Task: Determine Textual Entailment with Epistemic Reasoning

Instructions:
You are a logical reasoning system. Your task is to determine if the Premise sentence logically entails the Hypothesis sentence. Pay special attention to sentences about beliefs, knowledge, and perception.

**Key Definitions:**
- **Entailment:** The premise entails the hypothesis if, whenever the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true.
- **Factive Verbs:** Verbs like "knows", "learns", "sees", "realizes" imply that their embedded clause is a true fact. (e.g., "He knows that X" entails that X is true).
- **Non-Factive Verbs:** Verbs like "suspects", "believes", "assumes" do not imply that their embedded clause is true. The belief could be wrong.
- **Belief Propagation:** If a person holds a belief about a complex fact, they also hold beliefs about the components of that fact. This includes resolving pronouns and other anaphoric references within the believed clause. (e.g., If Alex believes "the tall chef is cooking," then Alex believes "a chef is cooking". If Alex believes "a woman is running," then Alex believes the runner is a woman).

**Reasoning Steps:** For each problem, follow these steps strictly:
1.  **Identify Structure:** Parse the Premise and Hypothesis. Identify the main subject and the epistemic verb (e.g., knows, suspects).
2.  **Check Factivity:** If the embedded clause in the premise uses a factive verb (knows, learns, sees), note that this clause entails the truth of its own embedded content.
3.  **Propagate Beliefs:** For any belief verb (suspects, believes, assumes), the content of the belief is what the person believes to be true. If that content contains a factive statement (e.g., "that Charles learns that X") or a specific detail (like a pronoun), that detail is part of their belief. A belief that "Y knows X" entails a belief that "X".
4.  **Compare:** Determine if the Hypothesis is a logical consequence of the Premise after applying the above rules.

**Final Output Format:** After your reasoning, your final answer must be exactly on a new line as one of the following:
<answer>entailment</answer>
<answer>non-entailment</answer>

Now, analyze the following:
Question: Premise: [PREMISE]
Hypothesis: [HYPOTHESIS]
Options:
entailment
non-entailment

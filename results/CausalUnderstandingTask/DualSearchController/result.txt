‚úÖ Best Prompt:
You are given a scenario about causality. Determine whether the specified action was **a cause** of the specified outcome. Your answer should reflect what the majority of people would conclude based on everyday notions of causality and responsibility.

**Reasoning Steps:**

1.  **Essential Requirement (But-for Test):** This is the definitive test. Ask: "Would the outcome have occurred **at the specific time and in the specific way it did** if the action had **not** happened?"
    *   If the answer is **Yes** (the outcome would have happened anyway), then the action is **not a cause**. **Stop your reasoning here and answer `No`.** (Example: A redundant cause).
    *   If the answer is **No** (the outcome would NOT have happened without the action), then the action is a **but-for cause**. Proceed to step 2 to check if people would still be *reluctant* to call it "a cause" due to normality or omission.

2.  **Assigning Salience:** If the action passes the But-for test, people are more likely to call it "a cause" and assign responsibility if it was:
    *   **Faulty:** A mistake, misconduct, or a deviation from instructions/plans.
    *   **Intentional:** Done on purpose to bring about the outcome.
    *   **Proximate:** The most direct and immediate event in the chain, not a distant background condition.
    *   **An Action:** People are more likely to attribute causation to actions than to omissions, unless the omission violated a clear duty to act.
    If the action was normal, non-faulty, and a distant background condition, people may be reluctant to call it "the cause," but it remains *a* cause.

**Final Decision Framework:**
*   If the action **fails the But-for test**, answer `No`.
*   If the action **passes the But-for test**, answer `Yes`, unless it was a **normal, non-faulty, distant background action or omission without a clear duty**. In these rare cases, answer `Ambiguous`.
*   If two or more actions are equally but-for causes and the scenario does not clearly make one more salient (faulty, intentional, proximate), answer `Ambiguous`.

**Ground your reasoning in the facts provided.** Do not invent detailed counterfactual scenarios or assume probabilities not stated in the question.

**Important Examples to Consider:**
- **Redundant Cause:** If a person does not change a setting, but the outcome would have happened anyway due to another condition, their inaction is `No`t a cause.
- **Redundant Cause (Double Prevention):** If two independent actors each provide a sufficient condition for an outcome (e.g., both buy the only battery needed), neither action is a but-for cause. The answer for each is `No`.
- **Normal vs. Faulty Action:** If a person buys an item normally (like a bookend) and this completes a pair only because another person stole a matching item, the purchase is a but-for cause. However, because the theft is faulty and salient, the majority would say the thief caused the possession of the pair, not the purchaser. The answer for the purchaser is `No`.
- **Multiple Causes:** If two gardeners each apply a different chemical, and the combination causes harm, both are but-for causes. If neither acted faultily in the application itself (e.g., one just forgot to relay a rule), causation is shared and the answer for each is `Yes`.
- **Pre-Existing Condition:** If a terminal illness guarantees death, and a medical error only changes the timing by a short period, the illness is the cause of the premature death (`Yes`), while the error is the cause of the immediate death.

After your reasoning, finalize your answer with `Yes`, `No`, or `Ambiguous`.

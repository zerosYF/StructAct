Determine whether the Premise entails the Hypothesis.

**Key Principles:**

1.  **Factive Verbs:** Identify verbs like *knows, understands, remembers, realizes*. These are **factive verbs**; they presuppose the truth of their embedded clause. If a person knows a proposition, that proposition is true.
2.  **Commonsense Inference:** Use reasonable real-world knowledge and pragmatic inferences to interpret the text. Make natural assumptions based on context (e.g., a "basket" in a "laundromat" is a laundry basket; "in the sun" suggests an outdoor setting like a beach). Do not invent far-fetched or bizarre counter-examples that defy common sense.
3.  **Core Action Focus:** Identify the core action or state in the Hypothesis. Entailment holds if the Premise supports this core fact. Minor, circumstantial details (e.g., a specific location) do not necessarily block entailment if they are highly compatible with the Premise.
4.  **Entailment Definition:** "Entailment" means that if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must be true or can be reasonably inferred to be true.

**Reasoning Steps:**
-   **Step 1:** Extract the factual content presupposed by the factive verb in the Premise.
-   **Step 2:** Paraphrase the Hypothesis to isolate its core claim.
-   **Step 3:** Compare the Premise and Hypothesis. Use commonsense to bridge gaps between related concepts (e.g., "bin or basket" → "laundry basket").
-   **Step 4:** Judge entailment based on the core claim. If the Hypothesis adds a significant, new element that cannot be reasonably inferred from the Premise, then it is non-entailment.

**Reason step-by-step, then provide your final answer.**

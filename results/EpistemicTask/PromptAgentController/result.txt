✅ Best Prompt:
Determine whether the Premise logically entails the Hypothesis. Follow these steps rigorously:

1. **Identify the core claim** in the Hypothesis.
2. Ask: "If the Premise is true, does it **necessarily guarantee** that the core claim in the Hypothesis is also true?"
3. **Critical Rule:** If the Premise only describes a person’s belief, assumption, or thought (e.g., “X thinks that Y”), it does **not** entail that the believed proposition (Y) is true. The person could be mistaken.
4. Ignore surface-level text similarity. Focus on truth conditions.

**Example to Avoid Common Error:**
- Premise: Thomas thinks that John assumes a man is riding up an escalator.
- Hypothesis: John assumes a man is riding up an escalator.
- Correct Analysis: The Premise reports Thomas’s belief about John’s assumption. It does **not** guarantee John actually holds that assumption. Thomas could be wrong.
- Correct Answer: non-entailment

Apply this logic to the current problem. Output only `entailment` or `non-entailment` as your final answer.

**Task:** Perform Natural Language Inference (NLI). Determine if the Premise entails the Hypothesis.

**Definition:** Entailment means that if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true.

**Core Principle:**
- A factive mental state (e.g., *knows, remembers, sees, realizes, is aware, notices, understands*) is one that, by definition, can only be true if its complement is true. Therefore, "X [factive verb] Y" logically entails Y is true.
- If the Premise states that [Person A] has a mental state (e.g., believes, suspects, thinks, assumes) that [Person B] is in a factive state regarding [Event Y], then it is entailed that [Person A] has that mental state regarding [Event Y].

**Critical Checks Before Reasoning:**
1.  **Subject Check:** If the main subject (the person holding the belief) in the Premise is different from the subject in the Hypothesis, the answer is **non-entailment**.
2.  **Verb Check:** If the embedded verb in the Premise is non-factive (e.g., *believes, thinks, suspects*), it **blocks entailment**.

**Reasoning Steps:**
1.  Identify the main subject and their mental state verb in both Premise and Hypothesis. **If subjects differ, output non-entailment.**
2.  Parse the Premise to find any embedded clauses. Identify the verb in the deepest clause.
    - If this verb is **non-factive**, the outer mental state does not apply to the fact itself. Entailment is blocked.
    - If this verb is **factive**, proceed.
3.  Apply the factivity principle: `[Subject] [Mental State] that [X factive-verb Y]` is logically equivalent to `[Subject] [Mental State] that Y`.
4.  Compare the derived statement to the Hypothesis. They must match in subject, mental state, and core proposition.
5.  Perform the guarantee test: "If the Premise is true, must the Hypothesis be true?" If any doubt exists, answer non-entailment.
6.  **Invariant:** Do not use real-world knowledge. Base analysis solely on logical structure and verb definitions.

**Examples for Guidance:**
- ‚úÖ Premise: "Joseph assumes that Amelia understands that P."  
  Hypothesis: "Joseph assumes that P."  
  Entailment: Yes. "Understands" is factive.

- ‚ùå Premise: "Taylor suspects that Olivia believes that P."  
  Hypothesis: "Taylor suspects that P."  
  Entailment: No. "Believes" is non-factive.

- ‚ùå Premise: "Charlotte thinks that John sees that P."  
  Hypothesis: "John sees that P."  
  Entailment: No. Subjects differ.

**Output Format:**
First, reason step by step. Then, output your final answer within the tags `<answer>entailment</answer>` or `<answer>non-entailment</answer>`.

**Now, analyze the following:**
Premise: {premise}
Hypothesis: {hypothesis}

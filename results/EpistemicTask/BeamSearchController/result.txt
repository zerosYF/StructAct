‚úÖ Best Prompt:
Determine textual entailment by analyzing the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis. Your analysis must be based strictly on the information presented, without external knowledge or assumptions.

**Core Principles:**
1.  **Agent Tracking is Paramount:** A change of agent is an absolute barrier to entailment unless logically bridged by the premise.
2.  **Verb Factivity Dictates Truth:** The semantics of the main verb in the premise are critical.
    *   **Factive Verbs (`knows`, `sees`, `realizes`):** Entail that the agent holds the belief **AND** the embedded proposition is **TRUE**.
    *   **Non-Factive Verbs (`thinks`, `believes`, `assumes`):** Entail **ONLY** that the agent holds the belief. The embedded proposition's truth is **UNKNOWN**.
3.  **Nested Belief Unpacking:** For nested structures (e.g., "A [verb1] that B [verb2] that X"), process from the outside in. The factivity of the outer verb determines the status of the entire inner clause.
4.  **No Belief Transference:** One agent's beliefs are never automatically shared by another agent.
5.  **Belief vs. Fact Distinction:** Meticulously separate claims about what an agent *believes* from claims about what *is objectively true*.

**Reasoning Steps:**
1.  **Parse:** Identify all agents, verbs, and embedded propositions in the premise and hypothesis. Pay extreme attention to nested structures.
2.  **Classify:** For the key verb governing the hypothesis-related content, determine if it is **Factive** or **Non-Factive**.
3.  **Apply:**
    *   **If the hypothesis is about an agent's belief (e.g., "B believes X"):** Verify the premise explicitly attributes that exact belief to that exact agent. A premise of "A believes B believes X" does **not** entail "B believes X" unless the outer verb is factive (e.g., "A knows B believes X").
    *   **If the hypothesis is about an objective fact (e.g., "X is true"):** Verify the proposition is embedded under a **factive verb** with **no intervening non-factive verbs** (e.g., "A knows that B thinks X" does **not** entail "X is true").
4.  **Conclude:** Entailment exists **only if** every element of the hypothesis is directly supported by the premise under these strict rules. Otherwise, it is non-entailment.

**Output Format:**
After your reasoning, conclude with exactly one of the following tags:
<answer>entailment</answer>
or
<answer>non-entailment</answer>

**Example to Analyze:**
Premise: {premise}
Hypothesis: {hypothesis}

‚úÖ Best Prompt:
You are given an SVG path element description and a list of candidate shapes. Decide which option(s) match the visualization of the path.

Important:
- The path may consist of multiple disconnected line segments. When visualized, these segments may form one or more shapes.
- A shape with n sides may be drawn using more than n lines (e.g., with collinear segments forming a single edge).
- Coordinates are rounded to 5 decimal places. Treat points as identical if the distance between them is less than 0.001 or 0.1% of the largest dimension, whichever is larger. Ignore slight misalignments.
- The path may contain lines that form multiple distinct shapes. Select all options that correspond to shapes clearly visible in the drawing (i.e., closed loops that are large, well-defined, and not obscured by other lines).
- For polygons, check if they are closed (either explicitly or via collinear segments). For pentagons, determine convexity by checking the cross product of consecutive edge vectors: if all cross products have the same sign, it is convex; otherwise, concave. Use the shoelace formula with consistent vertex ordering (clockwise or counterclockwise).
- If no candidate shape matches, choose the option that corresponds to "none of the above".
- If multiple shapes are present and the options include a combination that matches, select that combination. If not, choose 'none of the above'.

Steps to follow:
1. Identify connected components in the path. Ignore isolated segments that do not form part of a larger shape.
2. For each connected component, group segments that are collinear (within tolerance) to form single edges. Check collinearity using cross product (if cross product magnitude is near zero, points are collinear).
3. Look for closed loops that form polygons. A loop is closed if start and end points are within tolerance or connected via collinear segments.
4. Simplify the polygon by removing intermediate collinear points.
5. Consider the overall bounding shape formed by the outermost lines.
6. Match to the candidate shapes, ensuring no diagonals are drawn if required.
7. If multiple shapes are present, select all options that match any clearly visible shape. If the options do not include the exact combination, choose 'none of the above'.

Candidate shapes:
1. rectangle that is not a square and with no diagonals drawn
2. square with no diagonals drawn
3. triangle that is not a right triangle
4. right triangle
5. parallelogram that is not a rectangle and with no diagonals drawn
6. trapezoid with exactly one pair of parallel sides and with no diagonals drawn
7. irregular convex pentagon with no diagonals drawn
8. irregular concave pentagon with no diagonals drawn
9. regular pentagon with no diagonals drawn
10. regular hexagon with no diagonals drawn

Examples of common mistakes to avoid:
- Example 1: A path may form a heptagon (7 sides), which is not in the candidate list. In such cases, no option matches.
- Example 2: A right triangle may have its hypotenuse not drawn, so it does not qualify as a complete triangle.
- Example 3: A trapezoid must have exactly one pair of parallel sides. Verify parallelism by comparing slopes.
- Example 4: A shape may have multiple segments that are not collinear, leading to a higher-sided polygon. Always merge collinear segments to simplify the shape.
- Example 5: If the options do not include a combination of shapes that are present (e.g., both a rectangle and a pentagon), choose 'none of the above'.

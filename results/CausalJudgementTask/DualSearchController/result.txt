✅ Best Prompt:
Answer questions about causal attribution by following these steps:

1. **Identify the outcome mechanism:** Determine the exact conditions that trigger the outcome.
2. **Apply counterfactual necessity:** Ask: "If the action had not occurred, would the outcome still have happened?" If no, the action is a cause.
3. **Check for joint causation:** An action can be causal even if it was only one necessary part of a sufficient set of conditions.
4. **Prioritize proximate cause:** In chains of events, the most direct and intervening action (especially by an independent agent) is the primary cause.
5. **Ignore normative factors:** Permissions, prohibitions, intentions, or rules are irrelevant to factual causation.

Focus solely on the mechanistic conditions that produced the outcome.

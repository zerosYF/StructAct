‚úÖ Best Prompt:
You are an expert analyst in causal attribution and intentionality. Carefully reason through each question by following these steps:

1.  **Identify the Effect:** Precisely define the specific outcome being asked about. Pay close attention to modifiers (e.g., "premature death," "because of") which refine the effect.
2.  **Map the Conditions:** List all known factors, rules, and their logical relationships (e.g., Effect requires A AND B, or Effect occurs if A OR B).
3.  **Apply Causal Tests:**
    *   **Tailored Counterfactual Test:** For each factor, ask: "If this factor were absent or negated, would the specific effect (considering timing/manner) still have occurred?"
    *   **Causal Structure Check:** Determine if the scenario involves:
        - **Conjunction (AND):** The effect requires multiple factors. Each necessary factor is a cause.
        - **Overdetermination (OR):** Multiple factors are individually sufficient. Each sufficient factor is a cause, even if not counterfactually necessary.
    *   **Normative Deviance:** Identify if any action violated a rule. A deviant action is often the primary cause, but normative actions can still be causal factors.
4.  **Analyze Intent (if applicable):** For questions about intention, determine if the agent knew a side effect was certain. If so, it is intentional.
5.  **Synthesize:** An event is a cause if it was an actual and sufficient factor (in overdetermination) or a necessary component of a sufficient set (in conjunction). The "because of" question often points to the decisive factor‚Äîthe one that introduced uncertainty or was the proximate trigger. Causation is distinct from blameworthiness; normative or unintentional actions can still be causes.

**Key Principles from Examples:**
- In conjunction, all necessary factors are causes. The decisive factor is often the uncertain one.
- In overdetermination, all sufficient factors are causes. The proximate trigger is often the focus.
- A deviant action may preempt a normative one, but normative actions can still be causal.

Now, apply this framework rigorously to the new question. Conclude with your final answer within `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.

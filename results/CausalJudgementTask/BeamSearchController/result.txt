Answer questions about causal attribution by applying a structured causal framework. First, identify the key events, actions, norms, and outcomes. Then, analyze causation using these principles:

1.  **Counterfactual Necessity:** Would the outcome have occurred *if this specific event had not happened*? If no, the event is a necessary factor.
2.  **Causal Sufficiency:** Was the event, by itself, enough to cause the outcome given the scenario's rules? If yes, it is a sufficient cause.
3.  **Normative Breach:** Did the event violate an explicit rule or norm designed to prevent the outcome? If yes, this strongly indicates it is the primary cause.
4.  **Normality & Deviance:** Compare the event in question to other necessary factors. Was it statistically unlikely, unexpected, or a deviation from the default course of events? Deviant events are typically weighted more heavily as the cause.
5.  **Overdetermination/Preemption:** If multiple events were each sufficient to cause the outcome, then each one that actually occurred is considered a cause. The outcome's dependence on another sufficient cause does not negate this.

**Synthesis Procedure: Follow these steps in order.**

*   **Step 1: Check for Sufficient Causes.** If the event in question was sufficient (Principle 2) and occurred, it is a cause. Output "Yes". This applies even in overdetermined cases (Principle 5).
*   **Step 2: Check for Normative Breach.** If the event violated a rule or norm (Principle 3), it is the cause. Output "Yes".
*   **Step 3: Check Necessity and Deviance.** If the event was necessary (Principle 1) but not sufficient:
    *   Identify if it was the most **deviant** or **unlikely** factor compared to other necessary conditions (Principle 4).
    *   If the question is about the deviant event, output "Yes". If it is about a normal/expected event, output "No".
*   **Step 4: Final Default.** If all necessary events are equally normal and no norms are broken, the event is a cause. Output "Yes".

Synthesize your analysis strictly based on this procedure. Output your final answer as "Yes" or "No".

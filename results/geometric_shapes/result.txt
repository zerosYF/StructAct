✅ Best Prompt:
Identify the geometric shape represented by the provided SVG path.

As a logical analyst, you will analyze the SVG path data to determine the correct geometric shape.

Here are some examples to guide you:
- This SVG path element `<path d="M 73.00,72.00 L 9.00,72.00 L 9.00,37.00 L 73.00,37.00 L 73.00,72.00"/>` draws a rectangle.
- This SVG path element `<path d="M 54.80,39.10 L 47.35,52.12 M 47.35,52.12 L 45.84,37.85 L 36.25,25.96 L 49.96,33.50 L 56.84,29.55 L 70.14,30.00 M 70.14,30.00 L 54.80,39.10"/>` draws a heptagon.
- This SVG path element `<path d="M 20.00,24.00 L 39.00,57.00 L 82.00,55.00 L 20.00,24.00"/>` draws a triangle.

Follow these constraints:
- Provide the exact shape name based on the options given.
- Ensure your answer is accurate and matches the shape described by the SVG path.
- Avoid guessing; only provide answers based on the provided data.
- Do not include any additional information beyond the shape name.
- Stick to the provided options and do not invent new ones.
- If the SVG path does not clearly represent any of the provided shapes, state that it is unclear.
- Double-check your answer before submitting it.

Remember:
- Accuracy is crucial; take your time to analyze the SVG path carefully.
- Focus only on the shape and ignore any other elements.
- Ensure your response is concise and to the point.
- Verify that the shape you identify matches the provided SVG path.
- If you are unsure, recheck the path and the options.
- Maintain a logical and analytical approach throughout the process.
- Format your answer by first explaining your reasoning, then providing the shape name.

Task: Count the total number of distinct physical items described in the user's list.

Instructions:
1.  Parse the list carefully. Count each item based on how it is phrased.
2.  If an item is stated in the plural with a number (e.g., "four cauliflowers"), that number is its count.
3.  If an item is stated in the singular with "a" or "an" (e.g., "a potato", "an onion"), it counts as 1 item.
4.  Treat compound nouns as a single unit. For example:
    - "a head of lettuce" is 1 item.
    - "a stalk of celery" is 1 item.
    - "a clove of garlic" is 1 item.
    - "a bunch of carrots" is 1 item (unless a number is specified, e.g., "a bunch of 6 carrots").
5.  Do not break down compound items into smaller parts. Count them exactly as described.
6.  Ignore whether the items are logically related (e.g., all being "vegetables"). Your only task is to count the explicitly mentioned objects.

Examples:

User Input: "I have four cauliflowers, a lettuce head, a garlic, a yam, a cabbage, a stalk of celery, a head of broccoli, a potato, an onion, and a carrot."
Model Reasoning:
- "four cauliflowers" = 4 items
- "a lettuce head" = 1 item (treated as a compound noun, like "a head of lettuce")
- "a garlic" = 1 item
- "a yam" = 1 item
- "a cabbage" = 1 item
- "a stalk of celery" = 1 item
- "a head of broccoli" = 1 item
- "a potato" = 1 item
- "an onion" = 1 item
- "a carrot" = 1 item
Total: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13 items.

User Input: "There are three apples, two bunches of grapes, and a banana."
Model Reasoning:
- "three apples" = 3 items
- "two bunches of grapes" = 2 items (each "bunch" is a single unit)
- "a banana" = 1 item
Total: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 items.

User Input: "I see five ships, a car, and an bicycle."
Model Reasoning:
- "five ships" = 5 items
- "a car" = 1 item
- "an bicycle" = 1 item
Total: 5 + 1 + 1 = 7 items.

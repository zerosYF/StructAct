‚úÖ Best Prompt:
You are an expert at accurate counting and itemization. Your task is to count objects mentioned in a query, carefully handling plurals, quantifiers, and collective nouns.

### Instructions:
Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Extract and Expand:** Identify every noun phrase with a quantifier (e.g., "three apples", "a car") or collective noun (e.g., "two garlics", "a head of broccoli"). Create a bulleted list where you expand all groups into individual, countable items. Each bullet must represent one distinct instance.
    - **Critical:** Expand every group. Never list a group as a single item.
    - **Ignore descriptive units:** For collective nouns (e.g., "head of broccoli"), count the underlying item (broccoli) and discard the unit.
    - Example: "a car, three pianos" ‚Üí
        - car
        - piano
        - piano
        - piano

2.  **Categorize if Needed:** If the question specifies a type (e.g., "vegetables"), label each expanded bullet with its category using common knowledge. Only count items matching the requested category.
    - Example: For "How many fruits?" and input "a peach and a carrot":
        - peach (fruit) ‚Üí count
        - carrot (vegetable) ‚Üí exclude

3.  **Count and Verify:** Tally the number of relevant bullet points. Then, cross-check by summing all original quantifiers from the input for items that match the category (if applicable). The two totals must match. If they differ, re-examine your expansion.

### Final Output:
Always provide your final answer within <answer> tags.

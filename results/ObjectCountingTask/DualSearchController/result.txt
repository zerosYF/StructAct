✅ Best Prompt:
You are an AI that accurately counts physical items in a list, optionally filtered by category. Follow these steps:

1. **Parse the input:** Identify every noun phrase representing a physical item.
2. **Extract quantities:** For each phrase, extract the numerical quantity (default to 1 if no number is stated, e.g., "a car" → 1).
3. **Apply category filter:** If the question specifies a category (e.g., "musical instruments"), exclude items not belonging to it.
4. **Sum quantities:** Add the quantities of all relevant items.

**Key rules:**
- Unit descriptors (e.g., "a stalk of celery", "a head of broccoli") count as one physical item.
- If no category is specified (e.g., "objects" or "items"), count all physical items.

**Examples:**

**Example 1 (Category filtering):**
Input: I have two accordions, a car, a trumpet, and three clarinets. How many musical instruments?
Reasoning: 
- two accordions → 2 (musical instrument)
- a car → 1 (not a musical instrument, exclude)
- a trumpet → 1 (musical instrument)
- three clarinets → 3 (musical instrument)
Total = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6
Output: 6

**Example 2 (No category):**
Input: I have a chair, three couches, and a car. How many objects?
Reasoning: (count all items)
- a chair → 1
- three couches → 3
- a car → 1
Total = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5
Output: 5

**Example 3 (Unit descriptors):**
Input: I have a stalk of celery and a head of broccoli. How many vegetables?
Reasoning:
- a stalk of celery → 1 (vegetable)
- a head of broccoli → 1 (vegetable)
Total = 1 + 1 = 2
Output: 2

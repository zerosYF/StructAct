You are an expert at precise counting and enumeration. Your task is to count specific objects of a requested category within a statement.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Identify and Extract:** Read the input carefully. Identify every distinct mention of an object, paying close attention to commas and conjunctions like "and" to separate items.
2.  **Parse Quantities:** For each distinct mention, extract the exact quantity.
    - Explicit numbers (e.g., "three cows") → stated number.
    - Singular articles (e.g., "a bear", "an apple") → quantity 1.
    - Collective nouns (e.g., "a pack of dogs," "a bunch of grapes") → treat as 1 single item.
3.  **Category Filtering:** Verify which extracted objects belong to the requested category. Explicitly exclude and justify the exclusion of any non-matching items.
4.  **List and Sum:** Create a bulleted list of each distinct, category-appropriate mention with its parsed quantity. Then, sum all the quantities to get the final answer.
5.  **Output Format:** First, reason step-by-step following the instructions above. Then, box your final answer as `<answer>N</answer>`.

**Example:**
Input: "I have a bear, two rabbits, and a cat. How many animals?"
Output:
Let's list each distinct mention and its quantity:
- "a bear" -> Quantity: 1 (animal)
- "two rabbits" -> Quantity: 2 (animal)
- "a cat" -> Quantity: 1 (animal)
Sum: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

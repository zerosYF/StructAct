**Task:** Accurately count the number of specific items (e.g., fruits, vegetables, animals, instruments) from a provided list.

**Instructions:**
You must follow these steps precisely and in order. Do not combine or skip any steps.

1.  **Identify the Target Category:** Determine the category of items to be counted (e.g., "fruits", "vegetables", "animals", "musical instruments").

2.  **Exhaustive List Parsing & Quantification:**
    *   Read the input text meticulously. Identify and isolate every noun phrase that is a candidate for the target category.
    *   **For each candidate phrase, apply these invariant Decision Rules to extract its base item name and resolve its quantity:**
        *   **Rule 1: If preceded by "a", "an", or "one":** Quantity = 1 (e.g., "a piano" -> 1 piano).
        *   **Rule 2: If preceded by an explicit number (e.g., "three", "four"):** Quantity = that number (e.g., "three drums" -> 3 individual drums).
        *   **Rule 3: If a plural noun lacks a quantifier:** Use context cautiously. If it seems like a general statement, assume it refers to one collective unit.
        *   **Rule 4: For collective nouns and standard units:** Apply standard interpretations (e.g., "a garlic" = 1 head, "a pair of shoes" = 2 items if category is "shoes").

3.  **Resolve Ambiguity and Exclude Non-Target Items:**
    *   Use context to confirm if an item belongs to the target category.
    *   Formally exclude any items that do not belong.

4.  **Create the Final Item-Count List:**
    *   List each item or group with its resolved, unambiguous quantity.
    *   **CRITICAL INVARIANT: The final count is the SUM of these resolved quantities, not the number of entries in this list. A single entry like "four beds" contributes 4 to the total.**

5.  **Calculate and Verify the Sum:**
    *   Sum the resolved quantities with extreme care.
    *   **MANDATORY VERIFICATION: You MUST explicitly state the full addition equation and re-add the numbers step-by-step to ensure arithmetic accuracy.**

6.  **Final Output:**
    *   Output your final answer within `<answer>` tags.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Input: `I have a piano and three drums. How many instruments?`
        *   Process: piano (qty=1), drums (qty=3). Sum: 1 + 3 = 4.
        *   Output: `<answer>4</answer>`

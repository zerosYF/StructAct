‚úÖ Best Prompt:
Answer electrical and electronics engineering multiple-choice questions by following a rigorous, step-by-step problem-solving methodology. For each question, adhere to this protocol:

1.  **Contextual Analysis:** Carefully read the question to identify all given parameters, constraints, and required outputs. Determine the problem context: whether it requires fundamental theory application, precise calculation, or practical engineering approximation using standard values or simplified models common in textbook problems.
2.  **Strategic Formulation:** Before calculations, outline the solution approach. Select the most efficient and context-appropriate method. For applied problems, consider whether standard empirical correlations, typical value ranges, or simplified formulas are expected rather than full first-principles derivations.
3.  **Unit Consistency:** Convert all given quantities into a consistent unit system (preferably SI units: kg, m, s, A, V, Œ©, J, etc.) before computations. Explicitly show all necessary conversions.
4.  **Systematic Solution:**
    - **General Formulation:** Recall and state all pertinent physical laws, equations, and principles. Present general symbolic formulas before numerical substitution.
    - **Structured Computation:** Solve symbolically where possible. Substitute numerical values only into final expressions. Document all computational steps clearly, including arithmetic operations.
5.  **Validation & Sanity Checking:**
    - **Mathematical Verification:** When feasible, validate the answer by checking against original equations or using alternative methods.
    - **Physical Plausibility:** Assess whether results are physically reasonable. Compare calculated values to known typical ranges and the distribution of provided options. If results are outliers, re-evaluate method selection and assumptions.
6.  **Option Selection:** After verification, compare final results to provided choices. If no exact match exists but one option is consistently close to all calculated values, select it as the intended answer. Choose the letter corresponding to the best match.

Your final output must be structured precisely as follows:

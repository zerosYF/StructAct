‚úÖ Best Prompt:
You are given a snippet from a legal opinion that ends with a citation followed by a `<HOLDING>` placeholder. The placeholder must be filled with the **exact, verbatim holding** from the case that was just cited.

Your task is to select the single candidate option that is a direct quote from the specific case cited immediately before the `<HOLDING>` placeholder. Do not rely on the surrounding text for legal reasoning; use it only to identify the correct citation. Your decision must be based on a verbatim text match, not on which option best summarizes the legal concept.

**Reasoning Steps:**
1.  Locate the case citation that comes directly before the `<HOLDING>` tag.
2.  Match the text of the candidate options to the known, verbatim holding from that specific case.
3.  Ignore the context of the paragraph. The opinion snippet is merely quoting another case; your goal is to find that case's precise holding.
4.  Output only the numeric index of the correct option.

**Examples of Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
-   **Mistake:** Choosing an option that is a good summary of the paragraph's topic but not the quoted case's holding.
-   **Example:** In a snippet citing *Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing*, the model incorrectly selected a option about prosecutorial misconduct because it fit the broader topic of evidence, rather than the correct option about judging JMOL motions.
-   **Correct Approach:** The citation (*Reeves*) is the only clue. Find the option that is a direct quote from *Reeves*.

-   **Mistake:** Selecting the most comprehensive legal principle instead of the direct quote.
-   **Example:** In a snippet citing *Mead*, the model incorrectly chose a long, accurate summary of *Chevron* deference instead of the shorter, verbatim holding from the *Mead* decision.
-   **Correct Approach:** Prioritize a verbatim match over conceptual accuracy. The task is to complete the sentence with a quote, not to analyze the law.

Output your final answer as the numeric index wrapped in `<answer>` tags, e.g., `<answer>2</answer>`.

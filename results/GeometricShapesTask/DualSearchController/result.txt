‚úÖ Best Prompt:
Name the geometric shape drawn by an SVG path element. Choose from the provided options.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Preprocess the Path:**
    - Before parsing, check for redundant `M` commands. If an `M` or `m` command is followed by coordinates that are **identical to the current point**, treat it as a continuation of the previous path segment, not a new subpath. This is a common technique to ensure precision.

2.  **Parse the Path Commands:**
    - `M`/`m` (MoveTo): Lifts the pen and moves to a new location. **Only starts a new subpath if it moves to a location *different* from the current point.**
    - `L`/`l` (LineTo): Draws a straight line from the current point to a new point.
    - `Z`/`z` (ClosePath): Draws a straight line back to the first point of the *current continuous path*.

3.  **To identify the shape, follow these steps:**
    a. Break the path into separate **continuous paths**. A new continuous path begins only after an `M`/`m` that moves to a new, distinct location.
    b. For a continuous path to be a polygon, it must be a closed shape. It is closed either by a final `Z` command or by the last point being exactly equal to the very first point of that continuous path.
    c. **Crucially, count only the unique vertices in the continuous path.** The starting point (after an `M`) and all points from `L` commands are vertices. The final point that closes the shape (via `Z` or an `L` back to the start) is a duplicate and should **not** be counted again.
    d. A single `<path>` can contain multiple shapes. The overall shape is defined by the largest closed continuous path. If no continuous path is closed, the answer may be "line".

4.  **Avoid common mistakes:**
    - Do not simply count all coordinate pairs. You must interpret the commands.
    - An `M` that moves to a new location is the start of a new path and is not a vertex of the previous path.

**Examples of Common Errors and Corrections:**

*   **Error:** Treating all `M` commands as absolute breaks, missing a single continuous polygon.
    *   Path: `M A L B M B L C L D L A`
    *   **Old Incorrect Analysis:** Two subpaths (line AB and open path B->C->D->A). Answer: "line".
    *   **New Correct Analysis:** The `M B` is redundant (already at B). The path is continuous: `M A L B L C L D L A`. It is closed (ends at A) and has unique vertices A, B, C, D (4 vertices -> quadrilateral).

*   **Error:** Counting the closing point as an extra vertex.
    *   Path: `M A L B L C Z` (a triangle).
    *   Correct vertices: A, B, C (3 vertices -> triangle).
    *   Incorrect count: A, B, C, A (4 vertices -> wrong shape).

**Options:** circle, heptagon, hexagon, kite, line, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, triangle

**Now, analyze this path:**
<path d="[PATH_DATA]"/>

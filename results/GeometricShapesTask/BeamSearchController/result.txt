‚úÖ Best Prompt:
You are an expert geometric shape classifier. Your task is to analyze an SVG path string and identify the geometric shape it draws from a provided list of options.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**

1.  **Identify Subpaths:** First, parse the `d` attribute to identify all distinct subpaths. A new subpath starts with every non-redundant `M` (MoveTo) command.
    *   A redundant `M` command moves to the exact same coordinates as the current point. Ignore it; it does not start a new subpath.
    *   A non-redundant `M` command moves to a new location and always starts a new subpath.

2.  **Classify Based on Subpath Count:**
    *   **Multiple Subpaths:** If there are multiple distinct subpaths, the shape represents a "line" drawing (multiple separate segments).
    *   **Single Subpath:** Process this subpath as follows:

3.  **Reconstruct the Continuous Path:** Process all commands in order, ignoring redundant moves but preserving the path structure.
    *   Treat `Z` (ClosePath) as a line to the first point of the current subpath.

4.  **Extract a Clean Vertex List:** Build a list of all points that define the shape's corners.
    *   Start with the coordinates from the first `M` command.
    *   For every subsequent `L`, `C`, `Q`, or `A` command, add the endpoint to the list.
    *   **Remove consecutive duplicate points** (within 0.01 tolerance).

5.  **Check for Closure:** The shape is closed if the final vertex is identical to the first vertex (within 0.01 tolerance) OR if the path explicitly ends with a `Z` command. If not closed, the shape is "line".

6.  **Count Unique Vertices:** The number of vertices in your final cleaned list is the number of sides. Do not double-count the starting point.

7.  **Map Vertex Count to Shape:**
    *   3 vertices: triangle
    *   4 vertices: quadrilateral (proceed to step 8)
    *   5 vertices: pentagon
    *   6 vertices: hexagon
    *   7 vertices: heptagon
    *   8 vertices: octagon
    *   Many vertices or presence of `A` commands: "circle" or "sector"

8.  **Analyze Quadrilaterals:** For closed 4-sided shapes:
    *   **Rectangle:** Check for right angles using vector dot products (tolerance: 0.1 for near-zero values)
    *   **Kite:** Check if two distinct pairs of adjacent sides are equal in length (tolerance: 0.1)

9.  **Final Selection:** Choose the most specific correct shape name from the provided options. If multiple subpaths exist, the answer is "line".

**Reasoning Format:** Before answering, think step-by-step. You must:
- List all identified subpaths and their properties
- Show your cleaned vertex list for the main shape
- State whether the path is closed and why
- Justify your final shape conclusion

**Output Format:** Your final answer must be placed within the XML tag: `<answer>shape_name</answer>`

✅ Best Prompt:
Classify the given text into multiple hate speech labels. The labels include violence, directed_vs_generalized, gender, race, national_origin, disability, religion, and sexual_orientation. Each label should be assigned a value of 0 (not present) or 1 (present).

Assume the role of a Logical Analyst (Contextualized). Your analysis should be detailed and contextually informed.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** Two things are apparent: one, not a male and two, your ass is indeed sorry that it's been turned into a drive-in.
- **Analysis:** The text contains a gender-based insult ("not a male") and a sexual orientation reference ("your ass is indeed sorry"). There is no direct threat of violence, and no references to race, national origin, disability, religion, or other categories.
- **Output:** {"violence": 0, "directed_vs_generalized": 1, "gender": 1, "race": 0, "national_origin": 0, "disability": 0, "religion": 0, "sexual_orientation": 1}

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** If only he was black....He would be literally be behind bars faster than you can even imagine
- **Analysis:** The text contains a racial reference ("If only he was black") and implies a generalized bias against black individuals. There is no direct threat of violence, and no references to gender, national origin, disability, religion, or sexual orientation.
- **Output:** {"violence": 0, "directed_vs_generalized": 1, "gender": 0, "race": 1, "national_origin": 0, "disability": 0, "religion": 0, "sexual_orientation": 0}

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** FUCKING NIGGER GO BACK TO AFRICA
- **Analysis:** The text contains a racial slur ("FUCKING NIGGER") and a directive to leave the country ("GO BACK TO AFRICA"). There is no direct threat of violence, and no references to gender, national origin, disability, religion, or sexual orientation.
- **Output:** {"violence": 0, "directed_vs_generalized": 1, "gender": 0, "race": 1, "national_origin": 0, "disability": 0, "religion": 0, "sexual_orientation": 0}

### Constraints:
1. Ensure that the classification is based on the presence or absence of specific hate speech elements.
2. Provide a detailed analysis for each input to justify the classification.
3. Maintain objectivity and avoid personal biases in your analysis.

### Cautionary Notes:
1. Be mindful of the sensitivity of the content and handle it with care.
2. Avoid making assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated in the text.
3. Focus on the context and the specific language used to determine the presence of hate speech.
4. Ensure that your analysis is thorough and well-reasoned.
5. Maintain a professional and respectful tone throughout your analysis.

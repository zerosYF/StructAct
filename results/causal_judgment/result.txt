✅ Best Prompt:
You are an expert in causal reasoning. Analyze the following question to determine if the specified agent caused the specified outcome. Follow this reasoning framework strictly.

**CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**
*   **Focus on Factual Outcomes:** The "specified outcome" is the physical event described. Ignore all words describing intention, knowledge, or permission (e.g., "intentionally," "knowingly," "against the rules"). These are irrelevant for causation.
*   **The Counterfactual Test is Decisive:** Your primary task is to apply the counterfactual test. If it shows the outcome depended on the agent's action, conclude YES. An action can be a cause even if it required other factors.
*   **Causation ≠ Blame:** Ignore the agent's knowledge, intent, or whether they broke a rule. An unintentional or unknowing action can still be a cause.
*   **Strict Output:** Your final output must be nothing but `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.

**Reasoning Framework:**

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Clearly state the factual effect in question, excluding all normative or mental concepts.
2.  **Apply a Counterfactual Test:** Ask "If the agent had NOT performed the action, would the outcome still have occurred?"
    - If the answer is "No, the outcome would not have occurred," then the action was a cause. Conclude YES.
    - If the answer is "Yes, the outcome would have occurred anyway," proceed to step 3.
3.  **Analyze Over-determination and Preemption:**
    - **Over-determination:** If multiple sufficient causes exist, the agent's action is still a cause if it was part of the actual sequence. Conclude YES.
    - **Preemption:** If an action preempts a normal process, making the outcome inevitable, a subsequent action that merely completes the preempted chain is not a cause. Conclude NO for that agent.
    - **Fixed Outcomes:** If the outcome is determined by external factors (e.g., a curve) and the action does not change the actual sequence, conclude NO.
4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Weigh the results from the previous steps to form a final judgment.

Finally, output your answer strictly as either <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.

Answer questions about causal attribution by analyzing the relationships between events, actions, and outcomes. Your goal is to provide a judgment that aligns with pragmatic, everyday reasoning about causes, focusing on explanation and responsibility.

**Core Reasoning Process:**

1.  **First, Assess Counterfactual Dependence:** Determine if the outcome would have occurred if the agent had not acted (or omitted to act). A "No" strongly indicates causation.
2.  **Then, Apply Key Principles:**
    *   **Explanatory Salience:** An action is a cause if it is a strong, intuitive explanation for the outcome, even if not strictly necessary. This is paramount for deviant sufficient conditions.
    *   **Normative Deviance:** An action that violates a policy, rule, or expected behavior is a primary candidate for causal attribution. A conforming action is rarely singled out as *the* cause.
    *   **Multiple Causes:** For jointly sufficient causes, each necessary part of the set is a cause (use deviance to break ties). A preempted subsequent action is not a cause. An action that creates a novel, harmful pathway is a cause.
    *   **Omissions:** A decision not to act is a cause if the agent had the ability and obligation to act, and acting would have prevented the outcome.

**Response Structure:**
-   **Summary:** Briefly state the scenario and the causal question.
-   **Analysis:** Systematically apply the reasoning process above. Explicitly state the counterfactual, identify relevant norms, and apply the principles.
-   **Verdict:** Clearly state "Yes" or "No" and provide a concise justification, naming the decisive principle(s).

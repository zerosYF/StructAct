✅ Best Prompt:
Analyze the following scenario to determine causal attribution. Your goal is to decide if the outcome happened specifically because of the agent's mentioned action or inaction.

**Reasoning Framework:**
- The agent's action/inaction is a cause if it was necessary to enable the outcome. To test this, consider if the outcome would have been prevented had the agent done the opposite.
- The existence of other sufficient causes does not negate the causal role of the agent's specific decision. Focus on the action mentioned in the question.
- The agent's knowledge and intent matter. If they were aware of a state and chose to preserve it, this choice can be causal.

After your reasoning, provide your final answer as "Yes" or "No".

‚úÖ Best Prompt:
You are an expert data extraction and classification system. Your task is to analyze a paragraph about object ownership and answer a quantitative question about items owned by "I" (the speaker).

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FRAMEWORK:**

**STEP 1: EXTRACT OWNED ITEMS**
- Identify every item explicitly owned by "I" using phrases like "I have" or "I also have"
- Extract the quantity stated immediately after these phrases (the first number mentioned)
- Ignore all narrative explanations (e.g., "initially I had X...")
- Completely ignore items owned by others

**STEP 2: CATEGORIZATION PROTOCOL**
For each extracted item, classify it using these rules:

**A. Mobile Phones:**
- Count any item containing mobile-related terms: "mobile", "iphone", "samsung", "huawei", "pixel", or other recognizable phone brands/models
- Include common variants: "galaxy", "nova", "pura", etc.

**B. Musical Instruments:**
- Count only universally recognized instruments: "guitar", "piano", "drum", "violin", "harp", etc.
- Include specific ethnic instruments: "sitar", "koto", "oud", "tabla", etc.

**C. Ambiguity Resolution:**
- **Misspellings:** Correct common typos (e.g., "cherrys" ‚Üí cherries, "raspberrys" ‚Üí raspberries)
- **Unclear Terms:** If uncertain about categorization (e.g., "tars", "pipas"), check immediate context
  - If surrounded by similar category items ‚Üí COUNT
  - If isolated or surrounded by different categories ‚Üí SKIP
- **Compound Terms:** Skip nonsensical compounds (e.g., "clementinefigs")
- **Mixed Categories:** Skip entire entries with mixed categories (e.g., "5 apples and cars")

**STEP 3: CALCULATION & VERIFICATION**
- Sum quantities separately for each category
- Show intermediate calculations for verification
- Compute final answer as specified in question
- Double-check arithmetic

**QUESTION:** {Question}

**PARAGRAPH:** {Paragraph}

**BEGIN YOUR RESPONSE BY RESTATING THE QUESTION. THEN:**
1. List all items owned by "I" with quantities
2. Categorize each item with reasoning
3. Show summation steps for each category
4. Provide final answer in <answer> tags

**CRITICAL EXAMPLES FOR REFERENCE:**
- "tars" without instrument context ‚Üí SKIP
- "pipas" surrounded by instruments ‚Üí COUNT as instrument
- "nissan frintier" ‚Üí Car (not mobile or instrument)
- "5 apples and cars" ‚Üí SKIP entire entry
- "cherrys" ‚Üí COUNT as fruit (corrected spelling)

Use these examples to guide your classification decisions. When in doubt, apply conservative categorization and skip ambiguous items.

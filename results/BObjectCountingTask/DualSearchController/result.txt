✅ Best Prompt:
You are given a paragraph describing various objects. Your task is to compute the quantity requested in the question.

Important Instructions:
- Focus only on items explicitly stated as being owned by "I" (e.g., "I have", "I also have"). Ignore all items owned by others.
- For each item, classify it as either a "musical instrument" or an "animal/insect". If the question involves another category (e.g., cars, mobiles), identify that category as well.
- Use only the final quantity mentioned for each item. Ignore any backstory, explanations, or intermediate quantities.
- First, list all items that "I" have with their final quantities.
- Second, classify each item into the relevant categories based on the question's requirements.
- Third, sum the quantities for each required category.
- Finally, perform the requested operation (e.g., absolute difference) using these sums.

Think step by step. Be thorough to avoid missing any "I have" items.

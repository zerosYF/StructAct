‚úÖ Best Prompt:
You are given a paragraph describing various objects. Your task is to compute the quantity requested in the question.

**Follow these reasoning steps precisely:**

1.  **Identify Ownership:** Extract ONLY the items explicitly stated as "I have" or "I also have". Ignore all items belonging to other people.
2.  **Categorize:** For each item you have, classify it into the specific categories mentioned in the question (e.g., mobiles, musical instruments, animals).
3.  **Filter Narrative:** Ignore all narrative text (e.g., "feeling great," "funny story," explanations). Focus solely on the final quantity number.
4.  **Sum Quantities:** Calculate the total for each category by carefully summing the quantities step-by-step to avoid errors.
5.  **Compute the Answer:** Perform the final mathematical operation (e.g., sum, difference) specified in the question on the category totals.

**Key Rule:** If an item you have does not fit into any of the requested categories, exclude it from your calculations.

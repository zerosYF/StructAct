‚úÖ Best Prompt:
You are an expert hate speech classification AI. Analyze the text strictly according to these definitions and rules:

**CATEGORY DEFINITIONS:**
- **violence (1)**: Explicit calls for, glorification of, or celebration of physical harm, injury, or death (e.g., kill, murder, genocide, massacre, harm, beat, exterminate). Systemic issues (e.g., incarceration) alone do not qualify.
- **directed_vs_generalized**: 1 = targeted at specific individual(s) using "you" or names; 0 = targeted at broad group
- **gender (1)**: Attacks based on gender identity (man, woman, non-binary)
- **race (1)**: Attacks based on race or perceived race
- **national_origin (1)**: Attacks based on origin, nationality, or citizenship status
- **disability (1)**: Attacks based on physical/mental disabilities
- **religion (1)**: Attacks based on religious beliefs
- **sexual_orientation (1)**: Attacks based on sexual orientation

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. Be conservative: Only assign 1 if text unambiguously matches definition
2. Explicit mention required: Only label categories with explicitly mentioned identifiers
3. "Behind bars" refers to incarceration, not physical violence
4. Criticism of religion ‚â† automatic violence classification
5. A single phrase can trigger multiple categories simultaneously
6. Evaluate each category independently using explicit evidence

**LEARN FROM EXAMPLES:**

Example: "If only he was black....He would be literally be behind bars faster than you can even imagine"
‚Üí {"violence": 0, "directed_vs_generalized": 1, "gender": 0, "race": 1, "national_origin": 0, "disability": 0, "religion": 0, "sexual_orientation": 0}
Reason: Incarceration references ‚â† violence; explicit race mention

Example: "With a face like that I bet you could scare your HIV into remission."
‚Üí {"violence": 0, "directed_vs_generalized": 1, "gender": 0, "race": 0, "national_origin": 0, "disability": 1, "religion": 0, "sexual_orientation": 0}
Reason: Targeted attack ("you") with explicit disability mention

Example: "MASS BLACK WORLDWIDE GENOCIDE IS OUR ONLY HOPE"
‚Üí {"violence": 1, "directed_vs_generalized": 0, "gender": 0, "race": 1, "national_origin": 0, "disability": 0, "religion": 0, "sexual_orientation": 0}
Reason: Explicit genocide call (violence) targeting racial group (generalized)

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:**
Output ONLY valid JSON: {"violence": 0|1, "directed_vs_generalized": 0|1, "gender": 0|1, "race": 0|1, "national_origin": 0|1, "disability": 0|1, "religion": 0|1, "sexual_orientation": 0|1}

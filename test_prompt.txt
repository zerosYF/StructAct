You are an expert boolean expression evaluator. Your task is to determine which of five complex expressions (A through E) evaluates to True. Only one is true. Follow these enhanced steps precisely:\n\n### Step 1: Parse and Group with Explicit Parentheses\n- Before evaluation, rewrite each expression with explicit parentheses to ensure correct operator precedence and grouping.\n- Use a stack-based approach to track nested parentheses and negations systematically.\n- Example: Rewrite `A and B or C` as `(A and B) or C` to avoid ambiguity.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify Negations with a Counter\n- For each sub-expression, count consecutive `not` operations from innermost parentheses outward.\n- Maintain a negation counter: increment for each `not`, and when reaching a non-negated term, apply:\n  - Even number of `not`s → result is `X`\n  - Odd number of `not`s → result is `not X`\n- Record the negation count at each step in an evaluation log.\n- *Complete all negation simplification before proceeding to other steps.*\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Arithmetic with Precision\n- Compute arithmetic expressions step-by-step:\n  - First: `*` and `/` (left to right)\n  - Then: `+` and `-` (left to right)\n  - Respect negative signs and operator precedence.\n- For division, compute exactly using fractions where possible. If decimals are needed, retain at least 4 decimal places for intermediate calculations.\n- For comparisons: \n  - \"is greater than\" = `>`\n  - \"is less than or equal to\" = `<=`\n  - etc.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Factual Statements Strictly\n- Treat natural language statements (e.g., \"The capital of X is Y\") as booleans using this exact capital list:\n  - Afghanistan: Kabul\n  - Armenia: Yerevan\n  - Azerbaijan: Baku\n  - Belarus: Minsk\n  - Cameroon: Yaoundé\n  - Canada: Ottawa\n  - Colombia: Bogota\n  - Denmark: Copenhagen\n  - Gambia: Banjul\n  - Germany: Berlin\n  - India: New Delhi\n  - Iran: Tehran\n  - Jordan: Amman\n  - Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur\n  - Nepal: Kathmandu\n  - Nigeria: Abuja\n  - Norway: Oslo\n  - Turkey: Ankara\n  - UAE: Abu Dhabi\n- Any textual deviation from this list (including extra words, typos, or formatting differences) → `False`\n\n### Step 5: Apply Logical Operations with Care\n- Precedence: Highest `not`, then `and`, then `or`\n- Use parentheses to explicitly group sub-expressions\n- Short-circuit efficiently but cautiously:\n  - In `and`: If any part is False → stop early (whole False)\n  - In `or`: If any part is True → stop early (whole True)\n- *Exception: Do not short-circuit if negation simplification or arithmetic evaluation is incomplete in the current sub-expression*\n\n### Step 6: Step-by-Step Evaluation Protocol\n1. Start from innermost sub-expressions (arithmetic, facts, or negations)\n2. For each sub-expression:\n   - Simplify negations completely using the counter method\n   - Compute arithmetic results with precise fractional/decimal values\n   - Verify factual statements against the capital list exactly\n   - Record intermediate truth value in an evaluation log\n3. Work outward systematically, maintaining the log for each nesting level\n4. For deeply nested expressions, create a detailed evaluation log showing each step\n\n### Step 7: Consistency Check\n- If multiple expressions seem True, re-evaluate in this order:\n  - First: Expressions with deepest nesting or most negations\n  - Recount negations in problematic expressions using the counter method\n  - Recompute arithmetic with exact precision (use fractions)\n  - Reverify factual statements against capital list strictly\n- Remember: Only one expression is True\n\n### Step 8: Output Format\n- After complete evaluation, output only the correct label, e.g., `(C)`\n- If uncertain, re-evaluate before outputting\n\n### Critical Examples for Guidance (Learn from Common Errors):\n\n**Example 1 - Negation Depth:**\nInput: `not not not not not (True)`\nSimplify: 5 `not`s (odd) → `not True` = `False`\n\n**Example 2 - Arithmetic Precision:**\nInput: `-8 / -2 * 3 + 1`\nStep 1: `-8 / -2 = 4`\nStep 2: `4 * 3 = 12`\nStep 3: `12 + 1 = 13`\n\n**Example 3 - Factual Accuracy:**\nInput: `(The capital of Nigeria is Abuja.) and (The capital of Norway is Bergen.)`\nEvaluate: `True and False` = `False` (Bergen ≠ Oslo)\n\n**Example 4 - Short-Circuiting:**\nInput: `False and (complex expression)`\nEvaluate: Immediately `False` (short-circuit)\n\n**Example 5 - Nested Evaluation:**\nInput: `not (not (5 > 3) or (2 * 2 = 4))`\nStep 1: Innermost: `5 > 3` = `True`\nStep 2: `not True` = `False`\nStep 3: `2 * 2 = 4` = `True`\nStep 4: `False or True` = `True`\nStep 5: `not True` = `False`\n\n**Example 6 - Common Mistake (Grouping):**\nInput: `not A and B or C`\nIncorrect: `not (A and B) or C`\nCorrect: `((not A) and B) or C` (respect precedence)\n\n**Example 7 - Common Mistake (Factual Deviation):**\nInput: `(The capital of the Nigeria is Abuja.)`\nEvaluate: `False` (extra \"the\" is deviation from list)\n\nNow, evaluate the following expressions carefully using this enhanced protocol:"

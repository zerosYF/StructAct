You are an expert boolean expression evaluator. Your task is to determine which of five complex boolean expressions (A through E) evaluates to True. Only one expression is True.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. **Precompute all arithmetic and factual statements first**:\n   - Evaluate arithmetic expressions with correct precedence: multiplication/division before addition/subtraction. Double-check negative numbers and division (e.g., `-8/10 = -0.8`).\n   - Evaluate factual statements using the definitive fact list below. Replace with True or False immediately.\n   - **Fact list** (use only these):\n        - Canada: Ottawa\n        - Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur\n        - Iran: Tehran\n        - Colombia: Bogotá\n        - Turkey: Ankara\n        - Armenia: Yerevan\n        - Cameroon: Yaoundé\n        - Nepal: Kathmandu\n        - Norway: Oslo\n        - Azerbaijan: Baku\n        - Germany: Berlin\n        - Afghanistan: Kabul\n        - UAE: Abu Dhabi\n        - Iraq: Baghdad\n        - Denmark: Copenhagen\n        - Jordan: Amman\n        - Gambia: Banjul\n\n2. **Simplify logical expressions systematically**:\n   - Start from the innermost parentheses. Use a counter to verify pairings—every opening parenthesis must have a matching closing parenthesis.\n   - Apply logical operators strictly in this order: \n        - `not` (highest precedence). Simplify multiple `not`s immediately: even number of `not`s cancel out; odd number reduce to one `not` (e.g., `not not X = X`, `not not not X = not X`).\n        - `and` \n        - `or` (lowest precedence)\n   - All operators are left-associative. For ambiguous expressions, explicitly group from left: e.g., `A and B or C` is `(A and B) or C`.\n   - Apply short-circuiting aggressively: \n        - If you see `False and ...`, immediately return False (ignore the rest).\n        - If you see `True or ...`, immediately return True (ignore the rest).\n\n3. **Evaluation steps for each expression**:\n   - Step 1: Replace all arithmetic comparisons and factual statements with True/False.\n   - Step 2: Simplify innermost parentheses first, replacing them with their boolean values.\n   - Step 3: Apply `not` operators: simplify multiple `not`s as above.\n   - Step 4: Apply `and`/`or` with short-circuiting.\n   - Step 5: If more than one expression seems True, re-check from Step 1—focus on arithmetic signs, fact errors, and parenthesis grouping.\n\n4. **Output format**:\n   - For each expression, state the result after simplification: \n        Example: \"A: False\" \n   - After all expressions, conclude with: \"Therefore, expression [X] is True.\"\n\n### Few-shot examples demonstrating common failures:\n[Example 1: Expression A from previous failure]\nIncorrect: Evaluated `True and False` as True due to misgrouping.\nCorrect: Always group left-associatively: `(True and False) = False`.\n\n[Example 2: Expression E from previous failure]\nIncorrect: Computed `-5*10 = 50` (sign error).\nCorrect: `-5*10 = -50`. Then `-50 > 9` is False.\n\n[Example 3: Expression B from previous failure]\nIncorrect: Used \"Putrajaya\" for Malaysia's capital.\nCorrect: Use fact list—Kuala Lumpur is correct.\n\n[Example 4: Expression D from previous failure]\nIncorrect: Missed short-circuiting: evaluated entire `False and ...` expression unnecessarily.\nCorrect: Short-circuit—once you see `False and ...`, return False immediately.\n\n[Example 5: Negation chain]\nIncorrect: `not not not not False` evaluated as False.\nCorrect: `not not not not False` = `not not (not not False)` = `not not True` = True.\n\n### Critical reminders:\n- Never trust your memory for facts—use only the provided fact list.\n- Negative numbers: `-5 - 3 = -8` (not -2).\n- Division: `-8/10 = -0.8` (negative divided by positive is negative).\n- Range calculation: `max(a,b,c,d) - min(a,b,c,d)` is always non-negative.\n- If parentheses are ambiguous, assume left-to-right grouping for `and`/`or`.\n- For extremely nested expressions, consider breaking them down into smaller sub-expressions and labeling them for clarity.\n\nNow evaluate the following expressions. Show your results for each expression (A-E), and conclude with the correct answer.

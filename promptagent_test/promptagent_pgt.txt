Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.\n\nTo help you, follow these steps:\n1. **Extract the relevant data** from the table, specifying whether it is names, ages, heights, weights, or any other attribute.\n2. **Perform the required operation** (e.g., sorting, filtering, comparing, summing).\n3. **Identify the specific penguin or attribute** as needed, ensuring you are working with the correct table if multiple tables are provided.\n4. **Provide the answer in the specified format**, bracketed between `<answer>` and `</answer>`.\n\n**Additional Guidelines:**\n- If the question involves multiple tables, clearly specify which table to use for the operation.\n- If the answer is not among the provided options, recheck the options and identify the closest match.\n- Handle edge cases, such as missing data or no results meeting the criteria, by providing a default answer or indicating the issue.\n- Ensure that the final answer is clear and unambiguous.\n- If the table is modified (e.g., adding or deleting entries), ensure the updated table is used for the operation.\n\nExample:\nHere is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:\n\n```\nname, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\nLouis, 7, 50, 11\nBernard, 5, 80, 13\nVincent, 9, 60, 11\nGwen, 8, 70, 15\n```\n\nFor example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.\n\nWhat is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?\nOptions:\n(A) Louis\n(B) Bernard\n(C) Vincent\n(D) Gwen\n(E) James\n\nSteps:\n1. Extract the names: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen.\n2. Sort the names alphabetically: Bernard, Gwen, Louis, Vincent.\n3. Identify the last name: Vincent.\n4. Provide the answer: <answer>(C)</answer>\n\n**Additional Example with Multiple Tables:**\nHere is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:\n\n```\nname, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\nLouis, 7, 50, 11\nBernard, 5, 80, 13\nVincent, 9, 60, 11\nGwen, 8, 70, 15\n```\n\nAnd here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:\n\n```\nname, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\nJody, 5, 430, 620\nGladys, 10, 420, 590\nMarian, 2, 310, 410\nDonna, 9, 440, 650\n```\n\nWhat is the cumulated age of the giraffes?\nOptions:\n(A) 26\n(B) 29\n(C) 41\n(D) 55\n(E) 67\n\nSteps:\n1. Extract the ages of the giraffes: Jody (5), Gladys (10), Marian (2), Donna (9).\n2. Sum the ages: 5 + 10 + 2 + 9 = 26.\n3. Identify the correct option: (A) 26.\n4. Provide the answer: <answer>(A)</answer>\n\n**Edge Case Example:**\nHere is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:\n\n```\nname, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\nLouis, 7, 50, 11\nBernard, 5, 80, 13\nVincent, 9, 60, 11\nGwen, 8, 70, 15\n```\n\nWe now add a penguin to the table:\nJames, 12, 90, 12\n\nWhat is the name of the penguin that is 100 cm tall?\nOptions:\n(A) Louis\n(B) Bernard\n(C) Vincent\n(D) Gwen\n(E) James\n\nSteps:\n1. Extract the relevant data for height:\n   - Louis: 50 cm\n   - Bernard: 80 cm\n   - Vincent: 60 cm\n   - Gwen: 70 cm\n   - James: 90 cm\n\n2. Identify the penguin that is 100 cm tall:\n   - No penguin is 100 cm tall.\n\n3. Provide a default answer or indicate the issue:\n   - No penguin meets the criteria.\n\n4. Provide the answer: <answer>No penguin is 100 cm tall.</answer>

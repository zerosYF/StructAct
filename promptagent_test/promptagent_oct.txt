Questions that involve listing and counting objects of different types. The model should:\n1. List each object or type of object with its quantity using the format \"1. Object - Quantity\".\n2. Sum up the quantities and provide the total count.\n3. State the total number of objects clearly using the format \"Total: Sum\".\n4. If there are multiple quantities of the same object, list them separately.\n5. Ensure the model understands the category of objects (e.g., fruits, musical instruments, vegetables, animals).\n6. Use a numbered list for the enumeration and a clear statement for the total.\n7. After adding up the quantities, double-check the summation to ensure accuracy.\n8. When dealing with large numbers, break down the summation into smaller parts to avoid errors.\n9. Provide a clear and concise final statement of the total number of objects.\n10. If an object can belong to multiple categories, specify the primary category for counting purposes.\n11. If the input contains inconsistent or unclear information, ask for clarification before providing the response.\n\nExample Input:\nI have a table, three chairs, an oven, two toasters, a microwave, and a bed. How many objects do I have?\n\nExample Response:\nLet's list and count the objects you mentioned:\n1. Table - 1\n2. Chairs - 3\n3. Oven - 1\n4. Toasters - 2\n5. Microwave - 1\n6.

Pear - 1\n\nNow, let's add them up:\n1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 7\n\nTotal: 7\n\nSo, you have a total of 7 fruits.\n\nExample Input:\nI have a lettuce head, a head of broccoli, a carrot, a yam, an onion, and a potato. How many vegetables do I have?\n\nExample Response:\nLet's list and count the vegetables you mentioned:\n1. Lettuce head - 1\n2. Head of broccoli - 1\n3. Carrot - 1\n4. Yam - 1\n5. Onion - 1\n6. Potato - 1\n\nNow, let's add them up:\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\n\nTotal: 6\n\nSo, you have a total of 6 vegetables.\n\nExample Input:\nI have a cow, and a goat. How many animals do I have?\n\nExample Response:\nLet's list and count the animals you mentioned:\n1. Cow - 1\n2. Goat - 1\n\nNow, let's add them up:\n1 + 1 = 2\n\nTotal: 2\n\nSo, you have a total of 2 animals.\n\nExample Input:\nI have no apples, one banana, and two oranges. How many fruits do I have?\n\nExample Response:\nLet's list and count the fruits you mentioned:\n1. Apples - 0\n2. Banana - 1\n3. Oranges - 2\n\nNow, let's add them up:\n0 + 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTotal: 3\n\nSo, you have a total of 3 fruits.\n\nExample Input:\nI have a tomato, a cucumber, and a bell pepper. How many vegetables do I have? (Note: Tomato can also be considered a fruit, but for this count, we treat it as a vegetable.)\n\nExample Response:\nLet's list and count the vegetables you mentioned:\n1. Tomato - 1\n2. Cucumber - 1\n3. Bell pepper - 1\n\nNow, let's add them up:\n1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\nTotal: 3\n\nSo, you have a total of 3 vegetables.\n\nExample Input:\nI have a head of broccoli, a carrot, an onion, a cauliflower, a cabbage, a stalk of celery, a garlic, four potatoes, two yams, and a lettuce head.

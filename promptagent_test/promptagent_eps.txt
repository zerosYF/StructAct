Determine whether one sentence entails the next. Provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning, breaking down the premise and hypothesis into their components and analyzing the logical relationships between them. Specifically, consider the direction of belief and knowledge, the context, and the specific actions, beliefs, and observations mentioned in each statement. Ensure that you clearly distinguish between nested beliefs and direct beliefs, and verify that the premise logically necessitates the hypothesis for entailment to hold.\n\n### Key Points to Consider:\n1. **Nested Beliefs:** If A suspects that B knows C, then A likely suspects C.\n2. **Logical Necessity:** The premise must logically necessitate the hypothesis for entailment to hold.\n3. **Context:** Consider the broader implications of the statements.\n4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:** Break down the reasoning process into clear steps.\n\n### Additional Guidance:\n- **Nested Beliefs Example:** If James suspects that Amelia sees that three women sit together near woven walls, then James likely suspects that three women sit together near woven walls.\n- **Direct Beliefs Example:** If James suspects that three women sit together near woven walls, this is a direct belief about the situation.\n- **Logical Implications:** If someone suspects another person's observation, they are likely to suspect the observed fact.\n- **Clarifying Nested Beliefs:** When A believes that B believes C, it does not necessarily mean that B believes C. A's belief about B's belief is separate from B's actual belief.\n- **Contextual Clues:** Look for contextual clues that might indicate a logical connection between the premise and hypothesis.\n- **Direct vs. Indirect Beliefs:** Clearly distinguish between direct beliefs (A believes C) and indirect beliefs (A believes that B believes C).\n- **Avoiding Circular Reasoning:** Ensure that the reasoning does not rely on circular logic, where the conclusion is assumed in the premise.\n- **Considering All Possible Interpretations:** Explore all possible interpretations of the premise and hypothesis to ensure a thorough analysis.\n\nIdentify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.\nPremise: [Insert Premise Here]\nHypothesis: [Insert Hypothesis Here]\nOptions:\n- entailment\n- non-entailment

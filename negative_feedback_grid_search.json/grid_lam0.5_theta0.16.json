Only one is correct.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1.  **Work from the inside out:** Begin by evaluating the innermost parentheses or clauses. Simplify each step completely before moving outward.\n    - Use intermediate variables (e.g., P1, P2) to store results of inner clauses.\n    - Count parentheses carefully to avoid misgrouping.\n\n2.  **Resolve each component type:**\n    *   **Math Inequalities:** Calculate arithmetic carefully (mind negatives and fractions). Follow PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division (left to right), Addition/Subtraction (left to right). \"is greater than\" means `>`, \"is less than or equal to\" means `<=`.\n    *   **World Facts:** Use the following facts:\n        - Nepal: Kathmandu\n        - Canada: Ottawa\n        - Gambia: Banjul\n        - Jordan: Amman\n        - Armenia: Yerevan\n        - Afghanistan: Kabul\n        - India: New Delhi\n        - Denmark: Copenhagen\n        - Nigeria: Abuja\n        - Turkey: Ankara\n        - Iran: Tehran\n        - Cameroon: Yaoundé\n        - Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur\n        - Norway: Oslo\n        - Colombia: Bogota\n        - Iraq: Baghdad\n    *   **Logical Operations:** Apply `not`, `and`, `or` correctly. \n        - For `not` chains: \n            - If the number of `not` is even, the value is the same as the original.\n            - If odd, the value is the negation.\n        - `A and B` is true only if both are true. Short-circuit: if A is false, skip B.\n        - `A or B` is true if at least one is true. Short-circuit: if A is true, skip B.\n    *   **Max/Min Functions:** For `max(a,b,c,d) - min(a,b,c,d)`, list all numbers, find the largest and smallest, compute their difference, then evaluate the inequality.\n\n3.  **Simplify aggressively:** Use short-circuiting. If you find `False and ...`, the whole `and` is false. If you find `True or ...`, the whole `or` is true.\n\n4.  **Propagate truth values:** Keep track of the boolean result at every step using intermediate variables.\n\n5.  **Verify your answer:** Once you find a `True` expression, check all others to ensure they are `False`. Only one answer is valid.\n\n**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**\n- Do not misplace parentheses: Use a counter to match opening and closing parentheses.\n- Do not ignore negative signs in arithmetic: Double-check signs in multiplications.\n- Do not confuse world facts: Refer to the provided list.\n- Do not forget to apply short-circuiting: It saves computation and prevents errors.\n\n**Output Format:**\n- For each expression, provide a step-by-step reasoning with labeled subexpressions.\n- After evaluating all, conclude your final answer on a single line in the format: `<answer>(LETTER)</answer>`\n\n**Examples of Common Mistakes:**\n1.  **Example 1 (Nested `not` chains):** \n    - `not not not True` should be evaluated as: \n        - `not True = False`\n        - `not False = True`\n        - `not True = False`\n    - Incorrect: Assuming it equals `True`.\n\n2.  **Example 2 (Short-circuiting):**\n    - In `False and (complex expression)`, the entire clause is `False` without evaluating the complex part.\n    - Incorrect: Evaluating the complex expression anyway.\n\n3.  **Example 3 (Max/Min):**\n    - For `max(-1, 2, 6, 1) - min(-1, 2, 6, 1)`, the max is `6`, min is `-1`, difference is `7`.\n    - Incorrect: Misidentifying max or min (e.g., thinking min is `1`).\n\n4.  **Example 4 (World Facts):**\n    - \"The capital of Malaysia is Putrajaya\" is `False` (use Kuala Lumpur).\n    - Incorrect: Treating it as `True`.\n\n5.  **Example 5 (Arithmetic):**\n    - `-1 * 10 + -4 * 4` = `-10 + (-16)` = `-26`.\n    - Incorrect: Misapplying operator precedence or sign rules.\n\nBy following these instructions and avoiding common pitfalls, you will accurately determine the true expression."

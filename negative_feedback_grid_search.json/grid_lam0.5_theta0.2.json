  "best_prompt": "You are an expert in evaluating complex boolean expressions. Your task is to determine which of the given expressions (A through E) evaluates to True. Exactly one is true.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. **Factual Knowledge**: Use these truth values for capital statements:\n   - True: The capital of Denmark is Copenhagen, Azerbaijan is Baku, Turkey is Istanbul, India is New Delhi, Germany is Berlin, Afghanistan is Kabul, Canada is Ottawa, Norway is Oslo, Armenia is Yerevan, Colombia is Bogotá, Iraq is Baghdad, Malaysia is Kuala Lumpur, Nepal is Kathmandu, Gambia is Banjul, Jordan is Amman.\n   - False: Any other capital claim (e.g., \"The capital of Canada is Toronto\" or \"The capital of Afghanistan is Kandahar\").\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Evaluation**:\n   - **Phase 1: Preprocessing**\n     - Replace all capital statements with their truth values based on the provided list.\n     - Compute all mathematical expressions (e.g., `max`, `min`, arithmetic operations). For division, use exact fractions or decimals as needed.\n   - **Phase 2: Negation Simplification**\n     - Apply negation rules recursively from innermost to outermost:\n        `not not X` → `X`\n        `not not not X` → `not X`\n        (Continue pattern: even number of `not` cancels, odd number reduces to single `not`)\n   - **Phase 3: Logical Evaluation**\n     - Begin with innermost parentheses and work outward.\n     - For each sub-expression, state its value before proceeding.\n     - Use intermediate variables if needed for complex nesting.\n\n3. **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:\n   - Misinterpreting parentheses: Always verify grouping before evaluation.\n   - Arithmetic errors: Double-check calculations, especially with negative numbers and division.\n   - Factual errors: Remember that only countries in the list have True capital statements.\n   - Negation chains: Simplify completely before combining with other operations.\n   - Do not assume exactly one true until all expressions are fully evaluated.\n\n4. **Output Format**:\n   - After your reasoning, output exactly: `<answer>(X)</answer>` where X is the correct letter.\n\n### Examples for Guidance:\n\n[Example 1 - Correct Approach]\nInput: Expression with nesting and factual statements.\nEvaluation:\n   - Step 1: Replace \"The capital of Iran is Tehran\" → False (not in list).\n   - Step 2: Compute math: `max(5, -7, 5, -6) - min(5, -7, 5, -6) = 12`.\n   - Step 3: Simplify `not not not False` → `not not True` → `not False` → True.\n   - Step 4: Combine: `(True and True) → True`, then propagate outward.\n\n[Example 2 - Common Mistake]\nInput: Expression with UAE capital claim.\nCommon Error: Assuming \"The capital of UAE is Abu Dhabi\" is True (factually correct but not in list).\nCorrect Handling: Since UAE is not in the list, the statement is False.\n\n[Example 3 - Arithmetic Pitfall]\nInput: `-5 * 4 + 5 * 7`\nCommon Error: Miscomputing as `(-5*4) + (5*7) = -20 + 35 = 15` (correct) vs. wrong operator precedence.\nCorrect Approach: Follow standard arithmetic rules.\n\nNow, evaluate the following expressions. Remember: Only one is true. Show your work clearly with labeled steps."

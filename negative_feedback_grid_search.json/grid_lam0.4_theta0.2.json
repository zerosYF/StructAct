  "best_prompt": "You are an assistant that determines which boolean expression evaluates to True. Follow these steps to ensure accuracy:\n\n1. **Resolve factual statements**: Treat natural language claims (e.g., \"The capital of X is Y\") as boolean values based on factual correctness (e.g., \"The capital of Germany is Berlin\" → True).\n2. **Simplify negations**: Reduce chains of `not` operations:\n   - `not not X` ≡ `X`\n   - `not not not X` ≡ `not X`\n   - Higher even/odd chains cancel similarly.\n3. **Compute arithmetic carefully**: Evaluate all numerical expressions step-by-step, respecting operator precedence. Convert phrases like \"is greater than\" to `>`, \"is less than or equal to\" to `<=`, etc.\n4. **Handle `max` and `min`**: Compute the maximum and minimum of given lists, then find their difference.\n5. **Short-circuit logic**: Leverage `or` and `and` short-circuiting:\n   - If `A` in `A or B` is True, the expression is True.\n   - If `A` in `A and B` is False, the expression is False.\n6. **Simplify from inside out**: Start with innermost parentheses, replace subexpressions with boolean values, and propagate outward.\n7. **Identify obvious truths/falsehoods**: Use clearly true or false components (e.g., `True`, `False`, simple arithmetic truths) to simplify quickly.\n8. **Verify only one True**: After evaluation, ensure only one expression is True, as stated in the problem.\n\nProceed step-by-step, showing key simplifications and computations. Your final output must be the correct option (e.g., (A))."

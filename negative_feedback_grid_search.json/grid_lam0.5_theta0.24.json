  "best_prompt": "You are an assistant that determines which boolean expression evaluates to True. Only one expression is true.\n\n**Follow these steps precisely:**\n1.  **Simplify nested `not`s**: Count the number of `not`s. An odd number negates the expression; an even number cancels out (e.g., `not not X = X`, `not not not X = not X`).\n2.  **Evaluate arithmetic first**: Compute all mathematical expressions carefully, respecting operator precedence and negative numbers.\n3.  **Evaluate comparisons**: Translate phrases like \"is greater than\" to `>` and \"is less than or equal to\" to `<=`.\n4.  **Evaluate `max` and `min`**: Find the maximum and minimum values in the list, then compute their difference.\n5.  **Use factual knowledge**:\n    - **True statements**: \"The capital of Denmark is Copenhagen\", \"The capital of Germany is Berlin\", \"The capital of Turkey is Ankara\", \"The capital of Iran is Tehran\", \"The capital of Afghanistan is Kabul\".\n    - **False statements**: All other capital claims (e.g., \"The capital of Norway is Bergen\", \"The capital of Turkey is Istanbul\", \"The capital of Nepal is Pokhara\", \"The capital of Belarus is Grodno\") are false.\n6.  **Short-circuit logical evaluations**:\n    - For `or`, if any part is true, the whole is true.\n    - For `and`, if any part is false, the whole is false.\n7.  **Break down complex expressions** from the inside out, evaluating the smallest subexpressions first before combining results.\n\nProceed step-by-step and ensure your final answer identifies the single true expression."

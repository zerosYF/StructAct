  "best_prompt": "You are an expert assistant that evaluates complex boolean expressions. Only one of the given expressions evaluates to True. Follow these steps precisely:\n\n1. **Parenthesis and Structure**: \n   - Carefully match all parentheses to determine the correct grouping and operator precedence.\n   - Break down each expression into its innermost sub-expressions first.\n\n2. **Evaluation Order**:\n   - Evaluate arithmetic expressions step by step (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction, etc.).\n   - Evaluate comparisons (e.g., `<=`, `>`) and factual statements (e.g., \"The capital of X is Y\") next.\n   - Apply logical operators (`not`, `and`, `or`) from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n3. **Factual Statements**:\n   - Use accurate real-world knowledge for factual claims (e.g., \"The capital of Norway is Oslo\" is True, but \"The capital of Norway is Bergen\" is False).\n\n4. **Negation Handling**:\n   - Simplify sequences of `not` operators carefully:\n     - `not not X` = `X`\n     - `not not not X` = `not X`\n     - (and so on for longer sequences).\n\n5. **Avoid Short-Circuiting**:\n   - Do not stop evaluation early, even if a sub-expression seems decisive. Outer operators or negations may change the result.\n   - For `and`, if any part is False, the whole is False, but ensure all parts are evaluated if nested under other operators.\n   - For `or`, if any part is True, the whole is True, but again, consider outer operators.\n\n6. **Consistency Check**:\n   - After evaluating all expressions, verify that only one is True. If multiple appear True, recheck your work for errors.\n\n7. **Common Pitfalls**:\n   - Double-check arithmetic signs and operations (e.g., negative numbers, multiplication).\n   - Ensure factual statements are correct (e.g., the capital of Nigeria is Abuja, not Lagos).\n   - Watch for deep nesting; work from the inside out.\n\nExamples of common mistakes to avoid:\n- Misparsing parentheses, leading to incorrect grouping.\n- Simplifying negations without considering the full context.\n- Short-circuiting evaluation in nested expressions.\n- Arithmetic errors in complex expressions.\n\nNow, analyze the following expressions step by step. Only one evaluates to True. Which one is it?"

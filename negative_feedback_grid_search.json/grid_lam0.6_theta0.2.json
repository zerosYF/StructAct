Your task is to determine which one of the given boolean expressions evaluates to `True`.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1.  **Interpret the Syntax:**\n    *   Treat all phrases like `\"is greater than\"`, `\"is less than or equal to\"`, etc., as their standard Python operators: `>`, `<=`, etc.\n    *   Treat all statements about capitals (e.g., `\"The capital of Azerbaijan is Ganja.\"`) not as strings, but as boolean values. Determine their truth value based on real-world facts. For example, `\"The capital of Canada is Ottawa.\"` is `True`, while `\"The capital of Nigeria is Lagos.\"` is `False`.\n    *   `True` and `False` are literal boolean values.\n\n2.  **Simplification Rule:** Remember that multiple `not` operations cancel each other out. An even number of `not`s is equivalent to no operation. An odd number of `not`s is equivalent to a single `not`.\n\n3.  **Evaluation Strategy:**\n    a.  **Identify and Evaluate Innermost Expressions:** Start with the most deeply nested components, such as arithmetic calculations (`max(5, -8, -10, 10) - min(...)`), comparisons (`4 * -6 > -5`), and factual statements.\n    b.  **Substitute Values:** Replace these innermost expressions with their computed boolean results (`True`/`False`).\n    c.  **Apply Logical Operations:** Move outward, applying the `not`, `and`, and `or` operations to the simplified values from the previous step.\n    d.  **Repeat:** Continue this process of substitution and application until you have a single boolean value for the entire expression.\n\n4.  **Final Check:** Remember that according to the problem, only **one** of the options (A through E) will evaluate to `True`. If your initial analysis suggests more than one or zero are `True`, double-check your work, particularly your arithmetic and the truth values of capital statements.\n\n**Examples of Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n- **Incorrect Arithmetic:** Double-check calculations, especially with negative numbers and divisions (e.g., `-4 - (-5 / 1) = -4 - (-5) = 1`, not `-9`).\n- **Misapplying `not` Operations:** `not not not True` equals `not True` equals `False` (three `not`s = one `not`).\n- **Factual Errors:** Recall that the capital of Nigeria is Abuja, not Lagos. The capital of Cameroon is Yaoundé, not Douala.\n- **Ignoring the \"Only One True\" Constraint:** If you find zero or multiple `True` results, re-evaluate your steps.\n\nNow, analyze the following expressions step by step. Show your reasoning clearly and conclude with your final answer in the format `<answer>([LETTER])</answer>`."

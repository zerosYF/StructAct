  "best_prompt": "You are an assistant that determines which boolean expression evaluates to True. You are given five complex boolean expressions. Only one of them evaluates to `True`. Your task is to identify which one.\n\nImportant guidelines:\n1. Treat all natural language statements (e.g., \"The capital of X is Y\") as boolean expressions that evaluate to `True` or `False` based on real-world knowledge.\n2. Treat natural language comparisons as equivalent to standard operators:\n   - \"is greater than\" → `>`\n   - \"is less than\" → `<`\n   - \"is greater than or equal to\" → `>=`\n   - \"is less than or equal to\" → `<=`\n3. All expressions are intended to be valid boolean expressions; do not dismiss any as invalid.\n4. Evaluate arithmetic expressions carefully step by step. Pay attention to negative numbers and division. Remember: multiplications and divisions before additions and subtractions.\n5. Handle nested parentheses by evaluating from the innermost outward. Use intermediate results (assign temporary names) to simplify complex expressions.\n6. For chains of `not` operators:\n   - `not not X` is equivalent to `X`\n   - `not not not X` is equivalent to `not X`\n7. Logical operator precedence: `not` has the highest precedence, then `and`, then `or`. Use parentheses to disambiguate if needed.\n8. For `max(a, b, c, d)` and `min(a, b, c, d)`, find the maximum and minimum values in the set, then compute `max - min`.\n9. Verify real-world facts carefully (e.g., the capital of India is New Delhi, not Mumbai).\n10. After evaluating all expressions, ensure that only one is true. If you find more than one, recheck your work.\n\nTo assist you, here are examples of common mistakes to avoid:\n\n[Example 1: Nested Negation Error]\nInput: not not not (False)\nMistake: Incorrectly evaluating as True instead of True (since not not not False = not not True = not False = True)\nCorrection: Simplify step by step: not not not False = not not True = not False = True\n\n[Example 2: Arithmetic Error]\nInput: -1 - (8 / 5) > 7\nMistake: Calculating 8/5 = 1.6, then -1 - 1.6 = -2.6, but incorrectly evaluating -2.6 > 7 as True\nCorrection: -2.6 > 7 is False\n\n[Example 3: Factual Error]\nInput: The capital of Afghanistan is Kandahar.\nMistake: Evaluating as True\nCorrection: The capital is Kabul, so this is False\n\n[Example 4: Max/Min Error]\nInput: max(-9, -2, -10, -4) - min(-9, -2, -10, -4) > 7\nMistake: Incorrectly identifying max as -2 and min as -10 (diff = 8), but then evaluating 8 > 7 as False\nCorrection: 8 > 7 is True\n\n[Example 5: Operator Precedence Error]\nInput: not False and False\nMistake: Evaluating as False (if interpreted as not (False and False))\nCorrection: not has higher precedence: (not False) and False = True and False = False\n\nNow, analyze the following expressions and determine which one evaluates to `True`."

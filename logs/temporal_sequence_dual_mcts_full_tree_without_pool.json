Follow these steps precisely and methodically:\n\n### **Step 1: Initial Setup and Timezone Verification**\n- **Identify Timezone Differences**: First, scan all input text (including schedules and constraints) to identify any participants in different timezones. If found:\n  - Establish a common reference timezone (typically the first participant's timezone unless specified otherwise)\n  - Convert ALL schedules, work hours, and time-based constraints to this reference timezone using the appropriate offset\n  - **Critical**: Explicitly state the reference timezone being used and document all conversions\n- **Work Hour Adjustment**: For participants in different timezones, convert their work hours (typically 9:00-17:00 local) to reference time using the same offset. For example, if +1 hour ahead, 9:00-17:00 local becomes 8:00-16:00 reference time.\n\n### **Step 2: Free Time Calculation**\n- **Process Schedule Descriptions**:\n  - \"Free only\": Participant is only free during explicitly listed intervals; all other times within work hours are busy\n  - \"Booked\": Participant is busy only during explicitly listed intervals; all other times within work hours are free\n- **Account for Work Hours**: Only consider times within adjusted work hours (reference timezone)\n- **Handle Edge Cases**:\n  - Zero-duration intervals (e.g., \"10:15-10:15\") should be ignored\n  - Gaps between free intervals are treated as busy\n  - Ensure continuous availability - adjacent but separate intervals do not create continuous free time\n\n### **Step 3: Apply Individual Constraints**\n**Document all constraints clearly before proceeding:**\n- **Timezone-adjusted Constraints**: Ensure any time-based constraints (e.g., \"end before 4pm\") have been converted to reference timezone\n- **Flexibility Constraints**:\n  - Can miss first X minutes: Must be free from (start time + X) to (end time)\n  - Can miss last Y minutes: Must be free from (start time) to (end time - Y)\n- **Clearing Constraints**:\n  - Can clear meetings ≤ Z minutes: Treat any busy interval ≤ Z minutes as free (modify free time accordingly)\n  - Can clear morning schedule: Treat specified morning interval as free every day regardless of bookings\n- **Timing Requirements**:\n  - Requires free time before: Ensure (start time - W) to (start time) is free and within work hours\n  - Requires free time after: Ensure (end time) to (end time + V) is free and within work hours\n- **Day-specific Restrictions**: Note any constraints that only apply to specific days\n\n### **Step 4: Meeting Parameters**\n- **Start Times**: Only consider start times on the hour or half-hour (e.g., 9:00, 9:30, ..., 16:30) within common work hours\n- **Duration Limits**: Consider all constraints that may limit maximum duration (e.g., day-specific max duration limits)\n\n### **Step 5: Availability Analysis for Each Day and Start Time**\nFor each day and valid start time:\n1. **Verify Initial Availability**: Confirm all participants are free at the start time (considering constraints)\n2. **Determine Maximum Duration**:\n   - Find the earliest end time due to:\n     - End of common free period across all participants (considering flexibility constraints)\n     - Latest end time allowed by participants with post-meeting requirements\n     - Work hour boundaries (adjusted for timezone)\n     - Day-specific duration limits\n   - **Critical**: Ensure the entire interval [S, S+D] is continuously free for all participants (no gaps)\n3. **Validate Constraints**: Verify the meeting satisfies all individual constraints:\n   - Pre-meeting free time requirements\n   - Post-meeting free time requirements  \n   - Duration restrictions\n   - Flexibility constraints properly applied\n\n### **Step 6: Find Optimal Solution**\n- Track the longest possible meeting duration (X) across all days and start times\n- Count the number of start times (Y) that achieve this duration\n- **Note**: If multiple days have the same maximum duration, include all valid start times from all days in Y\n\n### **Step 7: Output**\n- Report X and Y separated by a comma (e.g., \"150, 1\")\n- If no meeting is possible, output \"0, 0\"\n\n### **Validation and Quality Assurance**\nBefore finalizing:\n- Double-check all timezone conversions have been applied consistently to schedules, work hours, and constraints\n- Verify all individual constraints have been properly implemented\n- Ensure continuous availability throughout the entire meeting duration for all participants\n- Confirm start times are on the hour or half-hour\n- Validate that the solution respects all participant constraints\n\n### **Examples of Common Mistakes to Avoid**\n1. **Timezone Errors**: In a previous case, the model failed to convert Yolanda's schedule when she was one hour ahead of others, leading to completely incorrect availability calculations.\n2. **Work Hour Adjustment**: Remember to adjust work hours for participants in different timezones (e.g., Lisa's 9:00-17:00 local becomes 8:00-16:00 reference time when +1 hour ahead).\n3. **Constraint Application**: Ensure constraints like \"can clear meetings ≤ 30 minutes\" actually modify the free time calculation by treating short busy intervals as free.\n4. **Continuous Availability**: If a participant has free intervals 9:00-10:00 and 10:05-11:00, a meeting from 9:55 to 10:05 is not possible due to the 5-minute gap.\n5. **Day-specific Restrictions**: Remember that constraints like \"only accepts meetings on Tuesdays and Fridays\" eliminate other days from consideration entirely.\n\nBy following these steps meticulously and verifying each calculation, you will produce accurate and reliable scheduling solutions.",

Only consider times within work hours unless extended availability is explicitly specified.\n- **Important**: Ensure gaps between free intervals are treated as busy. Do not assume continuity.\n\n### **Step 3: Apply Individual Constraints**\n- If a participant can miss the first or last X minutes:\n  - They must be free from start time to (end time - X) for missing last X minutes\n  - They must be free from (start time + X) to end time for missing first X minutes\n  - If meeting duration ≤ X, they must be free for the entire meeting\n- If a participant can clear meetings of Y minutes or less:\n  - Scan all busy intervals and treat any with duration ≤ Y minutes as free\n  - Recalculate free intervals accordingly\n- If a participant requires Z minutes of free time before/after:\n  - Ensure [start time - Z, start time] or [end time, end time + Z] is completely free and within work hours\n- If a participant can clear their morning schedule (e.g., 9:00-9:45):\n  - Treat that specific interval as free every day, regardless of actual bookings\n- **Note**: Constraints may be day-specific. Before processing a day, check if any participant restricts meetings on that day (e.g., only allows meetings if duration ≥ 30 min).\n\n### **Step 4: Meeting Start Times**\n- Only consider start times on the hour or half-hour (e.g., 9:00, 9:30, ..., 16:30) within the common work hours.\n- The latest possible start time is determined by the earliest end time constraint among all participants.\n\n### **Step 5: For Each Valid Day and Start Time**\n- Determine the maximum possible meeting duration by finding the earliest end time due to:\n  1. The end of the common free period across all participants (considering constraints like flexibility to miss time)\n  2. The latest end time allowed by participants with post-meeting free time requirements\n  3. Work hour boundaries (adjusted for extended availability)\n  4.

If a participant has free intervals 9:00-10:00 and 10:05-11:00, a meeting from 9:55 to 10:05 is impossible due to the 10:00-10:05 gap. Always check for continuous availability.\n\n**Timezone Example:**\n- If Participant A is in GMT+1 and requires \"end before 4pm local time,\" and reference timezone is GMT, then \"end before 4pm\" becomes \"end before 3pm\" in reference time.\n\n**Constraint Application Example:**\n- If a participant can miss last 10 minutes and has free time until 16:00, they can attend a meeting ending at 16:10 as long as they're free until 16:00.\n\nBy following these steps meticulously and verifying each constraint, you will avoid common pitfalls and produce accurate results.",

Follow these steps precisely and methodically:\n\n### 🔹 Step 1: Timezone Adjustment\n- **Identify Timezone Differences**: If participants are in different timezones, convert all schedules to a common reference timezone. **Always use the timezone of the participant who is different**. If multiple participants have different timezones, use the most common one or the one explicitly mentioned in the constraints.\n- **Adjust Work Hours**: Convert each participant’s work hours (9:00–17:00 local) to the reference timezone using the appropriate offset.\n- **Adjust Time-Based Constraints**: Convert any time-specific constraints (e.g., \"end before 4pm\") to the reference timezone using the same offset.\n- **Meeting Boundaries**: The meeting must occur within the intersection of all participants’ adjusted work hours in the reference timezone.\n\n### 🔹 Step 2: Free Time Calculation\n- For each participant, derive explicit free intervals within their work hours (adjusted to reference time):\n  - If \"Free only\" is stated, the participant is free **only** during the explicitly listed times; all other times are busy.\n  - If \"Booked\" is stated, the participant is free at all times **not** listed as booked.\n  - **Important**: Gaps between free intervals are busy.

Check for gaps or bookings within the interval.\n  - **Constraints Check**: Ensure the meeting satisfies all day-specific constraints (e.g., minimum length on certain days) and that any required buffers are fully within work hours.\n\n### 🔹 Step 6: Find X and Y\n- Track the longest possible meeting duration (X) across all days and start times.\n- Count the number of start times (Y) that achieve this exact duration X.\n\n### 🔹 Step 7: Output\n- Report X and Y separated by a comma (e.g., \"150, 1\"). If no meeting is possible, output \"0, 0\".\n\n### 🔹 Additional Guidance\n- **Be Meticulous**: Double-check timezone conversions, constraint applications, and continuity of free intervals.\n- **End Time Interpretation**: \"End before X:00\" means the meeting must end by X:00 – 1 minute (e.g., \"end before 16:00\" means end ≤ 15:59).\n- **Avoid Common Mistakes**:\n  - Do not assume availability between free intervals; gaps are busy.\n  - Ensure buffers are fully within work hours (e.g., if 10 minutes after required, end time ≤ 16:50).\n  - Always use the most restrictive constraint when calculating limits.\n\n### 🔹 Examples to Avoid Common Mistakes\n- **Example A**: If a participant has free intervals 9:00–10:00 and 10:05–11:00, a meeting from 9:55 to 10:05 is not possible due to the gap. Always check for continuous availability.\n- **Example B**: If a participant requires 10 minutes free after the meeting and work ends at 17:00, the meeting must end by 16:50.\n- **Example C**: When converting timezones, use the timezone of the participant who is different as the reference, and ensure the meeting is within the intersection of all adjusted work hours.\n\nBy following these steps carefully, you will avoid common pitfalls and produce accurate results.",

Follow these steps precisely:\n\n### Step 1: Timezone Handling\n- If participants are in different timezones, convert all schedules to the first participant's timezone (reference timezone). Adjust work hours accordingly (e.g., 9:00–17:00 local becomes 8:00–16:00 in reference time if one hour ahead).\n- If no timezone differences are specified, assume all participants are in the same timezone.\n\n### Step 2: Free Time Calculation\n- For each participant, derive free intervals within their work hours (9:00–17:00 local, adjusted to reference timezone).\n  - For \"free only\": only the specified times are free (within work hours).\n  - For \"booked\": only the specified times are busy; all other times within work hours are free.\n- Assume all intervals are inclusive of the start time and exclusive of the end time (e.g., 9:00–10:00 includes 9:00 but not 10:00).\n\n### Step 3: Apply Individual Constraints\n- After free time calculation, apply constraints to modify free intervals:\n  - If a participant can miss the first/last X minutes, they must be free from [start] to [end - X] or [start + X] to [end].\n  - If a participant requires free time before/after (Z minutes), ensure [start - Z, start] or [end, end + Z] is free and within work hours.\n  - If a participant can clear their morning schedule (e.g., 9:00–9:45), treat that interval as free every day.\n  - Apply day-specific constraints (e.g., only certain days allowed, or max/min duration per day). Prune invalid days early.\n\n### Step 4: Valid Start Times\n- Only consider start times on the hour or half-hour (e.g., 9:00, 9:30, ..., 16:30) within the common work hours.\n\n### Step 5: For Each Valid Day and Start Time\n- Check if the day is valid based on day-specific constraints. Skip invalid days.\n- For each valid start time, determine the maximum meeting duration by finding the earliest end time due to:\n  - The end of the common free period across all participants (considering constraints like flexibility to miss time).\n  - The latest end time allowed by participants with post-meeting free time requirements.\n  - Work hour boundaries.\n- The duration is the minimum of these limits.\n\n### Step 6: Find X and Y\n- Track the longest possible meeting duration (X) across all days and start times, and the number of start times (Y) that achieve this duration.\n\n### Step 7: Output\n- Report only X and Y separated by a comma (e.g., \"150, 1\"). If no meeting is possible, output \"0, 0\".\n\n### Additional Guidance:\n- Be meticulous with interval boundaries and constraint application.\n- Below are common failure examples to avoid:\n\n**Example 1 Failure**: \n- Input: Sarah (needs 10 min free before), Karen (needs 10 min free after), Emma (end before 4pm).\n- Mistake: Not ensuring Karen's post-meeting buffer is fully free (e.g., meeting ending at 12:50 requires Karen free until 13:00).\n- Correction: Always verify the entire buffer period is free.\n\n**Example 2 Failure**:\n- Input: Eve (only Tue/Fri, ≥30 min), Olivia (can miss last 10 min).\n- Mistake: Not integrating Olivia's constraint into free time calculation (she needs free from start to end-10).\n- Correction: Adjust free intervals for Olivia to [start, end-10] when checking availability.\n\n**Example 3 Failure**:\n- Input: Zoey (1 hour ahead), Ava (only Tue/Fri, ≥30 min).\n- Mistake: Not clipping Zoey's free intervals to her adjusted work hours (8:00–16:00).\n- Correction: Always truncate free intervals to work hours.\n\n**Example 4 Failure**:\n- Input: Olivia (only ≤60 min on Mon/Thu), Sophia (end before 4pm).\n- Mistake: Overlooking day-specific constraints when pruning days.\n- Correction: First filter days based on constraints before processing start times.\n\nPrioritize accuracy and clarity in your reasoning.

For example, if a participant only accepts meetings on Tuesdays and Fridays, skip all other days.\n3. **Faulty Constraint Integration**: Always check end-time constraints (e.g., S+L < 420) before calculating availability from free intervals.\n4. **Ambiguity in Interval Mathematics**: Ensure that intervals are half-open [start, end) and that constraints like \"free time before/after meeting\" are correctly checked (e.g., [S-10, S) must be entirely within a free interval).\n5. **Computational Complexity**: First determine each participant's consolidated free and busy intervals for the day. Before iterating through start times, identify if a day is invalid due to participant preferences.\n\nBy following these instructions and avoiding common mistakes, you will accurately determine the longest possible meeting length and the number of valid start times.",

All time intervals are inclusive of the start time and exclusive of the end time (e.g., 9:00–10:00 means free from 9:00 to 9:59:59).\n- **Time Zones**: If participants are in different time zones, convert all schedules to a common reference time (e.g., the time zone of the majority). Adjust each participant's work hours to their local time in the reference time zone. For example, if a participant works 9-17 in their local time and is 1 hour behind the reference, their work hours become 10-18 in reference time.\n- **Constraints**: Carefully apply each participant’s specific rules:\n  - **Clearing Short Meetings**: If a participant can clear meetings of ≤X minutes, treat any booked interval ≤X as free. For \"free only\" schedules, if a gap between free intervals is ≤X minutes, treat it as free; otherwise, it remains booked.\n  - **Missing Parts of Meeting**: If a participant can miss the first or last Y minutes, ensure the attended segment is free. For a meeting of duration D, they must attend at least max(0, D-Y) minutes. If D ≤ Y, they must attend the entire meeting.\n  - **Free Time Before Meeting**: If required, the participant must have Z minutes of free time just before the start (within [9:00, S)). If the meeting starts at 9:00, this is impossible.\n  - **Free Time After Meeting**: If required, the participant must have Z minutes of free time just after the end (within [E, 17:00)).

Note: \"free only at\" means only those intervals are free; \"booked at\" means only those intervals are booked.\n   - Consider every valid start time (on the hour or half-hour between 9:00 and 16:30).\n   - For each start time:\n     - Check if it satisfies any \"free time before\" rules (within [9:00, S)).\n     - Check if all participants are free at the start time (after applying rules).\n   - For valid start times, determine the **maximum meeting duration** by finding the earliest end time due to:\n     - Participant’s next booking (adjusted for rules).\n     - End of workday (17:00, unless extended).\n     - Rules limiting attendance (e.g., missing parts or day-specific limits).\n     - Ensure \"free time after\" rules are satisfied (within [E, 17:00)).\n3. **Track the longest meeting length (X) and count (Y)** across all days and start times.\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:\n- Do not assume continuous free time beyond the next booking; participants may have multiple disjoint free periods.\n- For \"missing parts\" rules, ensure the attended segment is within free time.\n- For day restrictions, only consider the allowed days, but verify all participants are available.\n- When counting meetings, ensure distinct start times and days for the same duration.\n- Strictly enforce end time exclusivity (e.g., 9:00-10:00 means up to 9:59:59).\n- Check all constraints simultaneously (e.g., end time before 4pm and free time after).\n\n### Examples of Common Mistakes:\n- **Example 1**: If a participant has \"free only at\" intervals, gaps between them are booked unless cleared by a rule. Don't assume they are free.\n- **Example 2**: When converting time zones, adjust work hours. A participant working 9-17 local time who is 1 hour ahead in reference time works 10-18.\n- **Example 3**: For \"missing parts\", if a meeting is 30 minutes and a participant can miss 10 minutes, they must attend at least 20 minutes within their free time.\n- **Example 4**: A meeting ending at 16:50 requires 10 minutes of free time after, so it must end by 16:50 to allow free time until 17:00.\n\n### Output:\nReport X and Y separated by a comma (e.g., \"90, 2\").

Convert extended hours to common time if needed.\n- **Miss Part of Meeting**: If a participant can miss the last T minutes, they only need to be free from S to max(S, E-T). Similarly, if they can miss the first T minutes, they only need to be free from min(S+T, E) to E.\n- **Clear Morning Schedule**: If a participant can clear their schedule from 9:00 to 9:45, treat them as free during [9:00, 9:45) every day, regardless of their original schedule.\n- **Lunch Break**: If a participant has a lunch break, block that interval in their schedule even if they are otherwise free.\n- **Meeting Length Preferences**: Apply length constraints (e.g., max 1 hour) only on the specified days.\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Convert all schedules and work hours to a common time zone** if necessary.\n2. **For each day (Monday–Friday)**:\n   - Preprocess each participant's schedule: apply \"clear morning schedule,\" lunch breaks, and other overrides.\n   - Compute each participant's free intervals within work hours (common time).\n   - Find common free intervals across all participants by intersecting their free intervals.

For a participant ahead by Δ, their work hours are [9-Δ, 17-Δ] in common time.\n- **Free Time Before**: The free time interval [S-Z, S) must be within [9:00, 17:00). For example, S=9:00 requires Z=10, but [8:50,9:00) is invalid.\n- **End Before Constraint**: \"End before 4pm\" means E < 16:00, not E ≤ 16:00.\n- **Flexible Attendance**: If a participant can miss the last T minutes, they only need to be free from S to E-T (if E-T ≥ S).

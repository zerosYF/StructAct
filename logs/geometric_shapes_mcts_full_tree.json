Path Normalization and Vertex Extraction:**\n    *   Process all path commands (`M`, `L`, `Z`) **in the exact order they appear** to reconstruct the complete path trajectory.\n    *   For each `M` (moveto) or `L` (lineto) command, add the specified point to a sequential list.\n    *   For a `Z` (closepath) command, explicitly add the starting point of the **current subpath** (the point from the last `M` command) to the list to close the shape.\n    *   This master list represents the full path sequence, including any intermediate points.\n\n**2.  Identify the Closed Polygon:**\n    *   A valid polygon is formed only if the path is closed. This occurs if:\n        a) The path ends with an explicit `Z` command, OR\n        b) The final point in the sequence is identical to the first point of the current subpath (within a tolerance of 0.001 units).\n    *   If closed, extract the unique vertices **in the order they are visited** along the perimeter. Remove the final duplicate point if it matches the start point. The count of these unique, ordered vertices determines the base polygon type.\n\n**3.  Geometric Analysis (For Closed Polygons):**\n    *   **Calculate Side Lengths:** Compute the Euclidean distance between consecutive vertices (V1→V2, V2→V3, ..., Vn→V1).\n    *   **Check for Right Angles:** For each vertex, calculate the dot product of the two vectors formed by its adjacent sides. A dot product with an absolute value **less than 0.001** indicates a right angle (90°).\n    *   **Check Parallel Sides:** For candidate pairs of sides, check if their direction vectors are scalar multiples (i.e., their cross product is zero, with |cross product| < 0.001).\n    *   **Check Equal Lengths:** Compare lengths of sides that should be equal using a relative tolerance: `abs(a - b) / ((a+b)/2) < 0.001`.\n\n**4.  Match to Options:**\n    *   Compare your findings to the provided options. A shape must meet **all** defining criteria.\n    *   **Key Classifications:**\n        *   **Rectangle:** 4 vertices, four right angles, two pairs of parallel sides.\n        *   **Kite (Quadrilateral):** 4 vertices, two distinct pairs of adjacent sides of equal length.\n        *   **Trapezoid:** 4 vertices, at least one pair of parallel sides.\n    *   If the path is not closed, the shape is a **line**.\n\n**Question:** This SVG path element <path d=\"PATH\"/> draws a\nOptions: [OPTIONS]",

A closing `Z` command does **not** count as a side.\n    *   **Vertices:**\n        *   Create a list of all points from the initial `M` and all subsequent `L` commands.\n        *   If the last point's coordinates are identical to the first point's (within tolerance), remove this duplicate closing point.\n        *   The count of the remaining points is the number of **unique vertices**.\n4.  **Classify the Shape:**\n    *   **Open Path:** If the path is not closed and has exactly 2 unique vertices → `line`.\n    *   **Closed Path with Straight Lines (No Arcs):**\n        *   3 vertices → `triangle`\n        *   4 vertices → Proceed to Step 5.\n        *   5 vertices → `pentagon`\n        *   6 vertices → `hexagon`\n        *   7 vertices → `heptagon`\n        *   8 vertices → `octagon`\n    *   **Closed Path with Arcs (A commands):**\n        *   **Single Arc:** If the path consists of one `A` command that returns to the start point → `circle` (if rx equals ry) or `ellipse` (if rx != ry).\n        *   **Sector:** If the path is `M [center] L [point1] A ... L [center] Z`, or equivalent, forming an arc connected to a center point by two lines → `sector`.\n        *   **Multiple Arcs:** If multiple arcs with equal radii form a full loop → `circle`.\n5.  **Refine Quadrilaterals (4 vertices):** For a closed shape with 4 unique vertices and only straight lines:\n    *   Calculate the distances between all consecutive vertices (side lengths).\n    *   **Kite:** If two distinct pairs of adjacent sides are equal (e.g., (d1==d2 and d3==d4) or (d2==d3 and d4==d1)) → `kite`.\n    *   **Rectangle:** If all four interior angles are approximately 90 degrees (check by calculating dot products of consecutive side vectors) → `rectangle`.\n    *   If neither condition is met, it is a general quadrilateral. (Note: Based on the provided options, `kite` is often the default assumption for a 4-sided shape that is not a rectangle).\n6.  **Final Selection:** Match the deduced shape to the provided options. The count of unique vertices is definitive for polygons.

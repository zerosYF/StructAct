You are an expert at analyzing SVG paths to identify geometric shapes. Follow these structured steps:

1. **Parse Commands**: Extract all points from M (move), L (line), and A (arc) commands. Note that M may start new subpaths, but the overall shape is defined by connectivity.
2. **Check Closure**: Verify the path ends at the starting point (explicitly or via "Z"). If not closed, consider "line".
3. **Count Vertices**: List distinct points in the connected loop. Ignore redundant moves.
4. **Handle Arcs**: If an A command exists with rx = ry (circular arc), check if straight lines connect arc endpoints to a common center (distances â‰ˆ radius). If so, it's a sector.
5. **Analyze Quadrilaterals**: For 4 vertices:
   - Compute side lengths and vectors.
   - Opposite sides equal and parallel â†’ parallelogram.
   - Dot product â‰ˆ 0 for adjacent sides â†’ rectangle.
   - Two pairs of adjacent equal sides â†’ kite.
6. **Classify Polygons**: N distinct vertices â†’ N-gon (e.g., 5: pentagon, 6: hexagon, 7: heptagon, 8: octagon).
7. **Match Options**: Eliminate impossibilities (e.g., curves exclude polygons, wrong side counts exclude n-gons).

You are an expert at analyzing SVG paths. Your task is to identify the geometric shape drawn by the path when rendered.
Follow these reasoning steps strictly:

1.  **List all commands** in the path (e.g., `M`, `A`, `L`, `Z`).
2.  **For each Arc (`A`) command:** Check if `rx` equals `ry`. **If `rx = ry`, the arc is circular. If `rx != ry`, it is elliptical.**
3.  **Determine if the path is closed:** Does it end at its starting point (either via a `Z` command or by matching the coordinate of the first `M` command)? **This is based on coordinate equality, not just the presence of `Z`.**
4.  **Check for straight lines:** Look for any line commands (`L`, `l`, `H`, `h`, `V`, `v`). **Their presence is a critical binary gatekeeper for the rules.**
5.  **Synthesize the shape** based on these rules:
    *   **Circle:** A closed path with **only circular arcs** (`rx = ry`) and **no straight lines**.
    *   **Sector:** A closed path that **must include two straight lines** (radii) and one circular arc.
    *   **Ellipse:** A closed path with **elliptical arcs** (`rx != ry`) and no straight lines.
    *   **Polygons (triangle, pentagon, hexagon, etc.):** A closed path with **only straight lines**. **Count the number of unique vertices/edges to determine the specific polygon. Ignore intermediate `M` commands if the path closes back to the original start point.**

**Crucial: The final visual result defines the shape, not the SVG syntax.** A circle can be drawn with multiple arcs. Multiple `M` commands may be present, but if the path closes back to the start, it is one single shape.

**You are an expert at analyzing SVG paths. Your task is to identify the geometric shape drawn by the path when rendered.**
**Follow these reasoning steps strictly and carefully:**

1.  **List all commands** in the path (e.g., `M`, `A`, `L`, `Z`).
2.  **Check for multiple subpaths:** If there are multiple `M` commands, the path contains disconnected elements. Analyze each subpath separately. The overall shape may be composite (e.g., multiple lines). However, if endpoints of subpaths align, they may visually form a single polygon.
3.  **For each Arc (`A`) command:** Check if `rx` equals `ry`. **If `rx = ry`, the arc is circular. If `rx != ry`, it is elliptical.**
4.  **Determine if the path is closed:** For each subpath, check if it ends at its starting point (via `Z` or matching the initial `M` coordinate). Note: `Z` closes the path without adding a new vertex.
5.  **Check for straight lines:** Identify all line commands (`L`, `l`, `H`, `h`, `V`, `v`). Their presence is critical.
6.  **Count vertices and sides accurately:**
    - For closed polygons, the number of sides equals the number of **unique vertices** (points). The closing segment (via `Z` or final `L` to start) does **not** add a new side.
    - Example: A path with `M` and 5 `L` commands that returns to start has 5 sides (pentagon).
7.  **Synthesize the shape** based on these rules:
    *   **Circle:** A closed path with **only circular arcs** (`rx = ry`) and **no straight lines**. A full circle can be drawn with one or more arcs.
    *   **Sector:** A closed path that **must include two straight lines** (radii) and one circular arc. Verify the start point is the center (distances to arc endpoints equal the radius).
    *   **Ellipse:** A closed path with **elliptical arcs** (`rx != ry`) and no straight lines.
    *   **Polygons:** A closed path with **only straight lines**. Use the vertex count to determine the type (e.g., 5 vertices = pentagon).
    *   **Line:** One or more disconnected straight line segments (open subpaths).
    *   **Composite:** If multiple subpaths exist and do not connect, the shape is composite (e.g., two lines).

**Important: The final visual result defines the shape. Ignore the number of commands; focus on the rendered geometry. Perform distance calculations if needed to verify geometric properties.**

**Examples for Reference:**

**Example 1 (Sector):**

- Commands: `M`, `A`, `A`
- Single subpath, closed.
- Circular arcs (`rx = ry`), no straight lines.
- Endpoints are diametrically opposite (distance = 7.32, diameter = 7.32).
- **Conclusion:** circle.

2. **Check Closure**: Verify the path ends at the starting point (via "Z" or within 0.01 units). If not closed, classify as "line".
3. **Count Vertices**: List distinct points (distance â‰¥ 0.01 apart) in the connected loop. Ignore redundant moves to same points. Check for colinearity: if three consecutive points have unit vector dot product >0.99 or <-0.99, merge them (reduce vertex count).
4. **Handle Arcs**: If an A command exists with rx â‰ˆ ry (within 1%), compute chord length between endpoints. If chord â‰ˆ 2*r (within 1%), the arc spans 180Â°. If two such arcs (same radius/center) form a closed loop, classify as "circle". If lines connect arc endpoints to a common center (distances â‰ˆ radius within 1%), classify as "sector".

2.  **Check for multiple subpaths:** If there are multiple `M` commands, check if they share endpoints (within Â±0.01). **If subpaths share endpoints, treat them as a single continuous path. Only treat as disconnected if endpoints do not match.**
3.  **For each Arc (`A`) command:** Check if `rx` equals `ry`. **If `rx = ry`, the arc is circular. If `rx != ry`, it is elliptical.**
4.  **Determine if the path is closed:** Check if the final point matches the initial `M` coordinate (within Â±0.01). **A path is globally closed if it returns to the start of the first subpath.**
5.  **Check for straight lines:** Identify all line commands (`L`, `l`, `H`, `h`, `V`, `v`). Their presence is critical.
6.  **Count vertices and sides accurately:**
    - For closed polygons, the number of sides equals the number of **unique vertices**. The closing segment (via `Z` or final `L` to start) does **not** add a new side.

7.  **Synthesize the shape** based on these rules:

        **For quadrilaterals, further analyze:**
        - Compute vectors between consecutive vertices.
        - **If opposite sides are parallel (vectors are scalar multiples within tolerance), it is a parallelogram.**

        - **If at least one pair of parallel sides, it is a trapezoid.**
    *   **Line:** One or more disconnected straight line segments (open subpaths).
    *   **Composite:** If multiple subpaths are truly disconnected (endpoints not within Â±0.01), the shape is not a single polygon.

            - **Square:** Same as rectangle with all sides equal (within tolerance).
            - **Kite:** Two pairs of adjacent sides equal.
            - **Trapezoid:** Exactly one pair of parallel sides (check slopes with tolerance).
            - **Parallelogram:** Both pairs of opposite sides parallel and equal.
        - For other polygons, the number of edges determines the name (e.g., 3 edges: triangle, 5: pentagon).

**Crucial: The final visual result defines the shape, not the SVG syntax.** A circle can be drawn with multiple arcs. Multiple `M` commands may be present, but if the path closes back to the start, it is one single shape. Use tolerance 0.01 for all coordinate and length comparisons.

1. **Extract Subpaths**: Split the path at each 'M' command. Each subpath starts with an 'M' and includes subsequent commands until the next 'M'. Treat each subpath independently.
2. **Check Closure per Subpath**: For each subpath, verify if it ends at its starting point (explicitly or implicitly). If not closed, classify it as "line" and ignore for shape classification. Only consider closed subpaths for further analysis.
3. **Count Distinct Vertices**: For each closed subpath, list all unique points in order. Merge collinear points (cross product magnitude < 1e-5) to avoid degeneracy.
4. **Handle Arcs**: If no 'A' commands, eliminate "circle" and "sector". If arcs exist with rx=ry, check for sector geometry.

**You are an expert at analyzing SVG paths. Your task is to identify the geometric shape drawn by the path when rendered.**
**Follow these reasoning steps strictly and carefully:**

1.  **List all commands** in the path (e.g., `M`, `A`, `L`, `Z`).
2.  **Check for multiple subpaths:** If there are multiple `M` commands, the path contains disconnected elements. Analyze each subpath separately. **However, if subpaths share endpoints and the overall path forms a continuous stroke, treat them as a single path for geometric analysis.**
3.  **For each Arc (`A`) command:** Check if `rx` equals `ry`. **If `rx = ry`, the arc is circular. If `rx != ry`, it is elliptical.**
4.  **Determine if the path is closed:** For each subpath, check if it ends at its starting point (via `Z` or matching the initial `M` coordinate). **Additionally, if the entire path ends at the same point as the start of the first subpath, the path is globally closed.** Note: `Z` closes the path without adding a new vertex.
5.  **Check for straight lines:** Identify all line commands (`L`, `l`, `H`, `h`, `V`, `v`). Their presence is critical.
6.  **Count vertices and sides accurately:**
    - For closed polygons, the number of sides equals the number of **unique vertices** (points). The closing segment (via `Z` or final `L` to start) does **not** add a new side.
    - Example: A path with `M` and 5 `L` commands that returns to start has 5 sides (pentagon).
7.  **Synthesize the shape** based on these rules:
    *   **Circle:** A closed path with **only circular arcs** (`rx = ry`) and **no straight lines**.
    *   **Sector:** A closed path that **must include two straight lines** (radii) and one circular arc.
    *   **Ellipse:** A closed path with **elliptical arcs** (`rx != ry`) and no straight lines.
    *   **Polygons:** A closed path with **only straight lines**. Use the vertex count to determine the type (e.g., 5 vertices = pentagon).
        **For quadrilaterals, analyze in this order:**
        - **Rectangle:** If opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, and all angles are 90Â° (vectors perpendicular, dot product within Â±0.5 of zero).
        - **Parallelogram:** If opposite sides are parallel and equal in length (but angles not all 90Â°).
        - **Kite:** If two pairs of adjacent sides are equal (lengths within Â±0.5).
        - **Trapezoid:** If at least one pair of parallel sides (within tolerance).
        *Note: A rectangle is a specific type of parallelogram. Choose the most specific available option from the provided list.*
    *   **Line:** One or more disconnected straight line segments (open subpaths).
    *   **Composite:** If multiple subpaths exist and are disconnected, the shape may not be a single polygon (e.g., two lines).

**Important: When comparing coordinates or vectors, consider values within Â±0.1 as equal to account for rounding errors. For perpendicularity, if the absolute dot product is less than 0.5, treat the vectors as perpendicular. The final visual result defines the shape. Ignore the number of commands; focus on the rendered geometry.**

**Additional Guidance:**
- **Always choose the most specific available option** when multiple classifications apply.
- **If mathematical calculations are ambiguous** (e.g., dot product between 0.1 and 0.5), consider the overall proportions and symmetry of the shape.
- **Remember that SVG paths often contain approximations** - focus on the visual intent rather than mathematical perfection.

**Examples for Reference:**

**Example 1 (Quadrilateral with Connected Subpaths):**
Path: `<path d="M 87.94,93.98 L 8.62,89.32 M 8.62,89.32 L 11.17,45.94 L 90.49,50.60 L 87.94,93.98"/>`

- Two subpaths, but share endpoint (8.62,89.32) â†’ continuous.
- Globally closed (ends at first point).
- Only straight lines.
- Vertices: (87.94,93.98), (8.62,89.32), (11.17,45.94), (90.49,50.60) â†’ 4 unique points.
- Vectors: AB = (-79.32, -4.66), BC = (2.55, -43.38), CD = (79.32, 4.66), DA = (-2.55, 43.38)
- AB || CD and BC || DA â†’ parallelogram.
- Dot product AB Â· BC â‰ˆ -0.196 â†’ absolute value < 0.5 â†’ perpendicular â†’ rectangle.

**You are an expert at analyzing SVG paths. Your task is to identify the geometric shape drawn by the path when rendered.**
**Follow these reasoning steps strictly and carefully:**

1.  **List all commands** in the path (e.g., `M`, `A`, `L`, `Z`).
2.  **Check for multiple subpaths:** If there are multiple `M` commands that move to disconnected points, the path contains separate elements. However, if a subsequent `M` jumps to a point already on the path, it may not be a new subpath. Analyze the overall visual shape.
3.  **For each Arc (`A`) command:** Check if `rx` equals `ry`. **If `rx = ry`, the arc is circular. If `rx != ry`, it is elliptical.**
4.  **Determine if the path is closed:** The path is closed if it ends with `Z` or if the final coordinate is identical to the initial `M` coordinate.
5.  **Check for straight lines:** Identify all line commands (`L`, `l`, `H`, `h`, `V`, `v`). Their presence is critical.
6.  **Count vertices and sides accurately:**
    - Extract all unique points from the path commands, ignoring redundant `M` moves. The number of unique vertices defines the polygon.
    - For closed polygons, the number of sides equals the number of **unique vertices**. The closing segment does **not** add a new side.
7.  **Account for floating-point precision:** SVG coordinates are often approximations. Use a tolerance (e.g., Â±0.1) when checking for equality, parallelism, or perpendicularity. Calculate vector dot products and cross products to check angles, but treat values close to zero (e.g., |dot| < 0.5) as zero.
8.  **Synthesize the shape** based on these rules:
    *   **Circle:** Closed path with **only circular arcs** (`rx = ry`) and **no straight lines**.
    *   **Sector:** Closed path with **two straight lines** (radii) and one circular arc. The start point must be the center.
    *   **Ellipse:** Closed path with **elliptical arcs** (`rx != ry`) and no straight lines.
    *   **Rectangle:** Closed quadrilateral with **only straight lines**. Both pairs of opposite sides must be parallel and approximately equal. Adjacent sides must be approximately perpendicular (dot product â‰ˆ 0).
    *   **Square:** A rectangle with all four sides approximately equal.
    *   **Other Polygons:** A closed path with **only straight lines**. Use the vertex count to name it (e.g., 4 vertices = quadrilateral, 5 = pentagon).
    *   **Line:** One or more disconnected straight line segments (open subpaths).
    *   **Composite:** Multiple disconnected subpaths.
9.  **Match to Available Options:** If your analysis yields a shape not listed (e.g., parallelogram), choose the closest logical match from the options (e.g., trapezoid). Re-check for coordinate rounding errors that may obscure the correct answer.

**Important: The final visual result defines the shape. Ignore the number of commands; focus on the rendered geometry. Perform distance and angle calculations with tolerance for floating-point imprecision.**

**Examples for Reference:**

**Example 1 (Rectangle with Rounded Coordinates):**
Path: `<path d="M 87.94,93.98 L 8.62,89.32 M 8.62,89.32 L 11.17,45.94 L 90.49,50.60 L 87.94,93.98"/>`
- Commands: `M`, `L`, `M`, `L`, `L`, `L`
- Single visual path (second `M` is redundant). Closed (ends at start).
- Only straight lines. 4 unique vertices.
- Vectors: AB(-79.32, -4.66), BC(2.55, -43.38), CD(79.32, 4.66), DA(-2.55, 43.38).
- Opposite sides parallel and equal.
- Dot product(AB, BC) â‰ˆ -0.15 â†’ within tolerance of 0 â†’ perpendicular.
- **Conclusion:** rectangle (not trapezoid).

**Example 2 (Circle):**
Path: `<path d="M 41.70,41.16 A 3.66,3.66 355.66 1,0 34.40,41.72 A 3.66,3.66 355.66 1,0 41.70,41.16"/>`
- Commands: `M`, `A`, `A`
- Single subpath, closed.
- Circular arcs (`rx = ry`), no straight lines.
- **Conclusion:** circle.

**Example 3 (Pentagon with Aligned Endpoints):**
Path: `<path d="M 55.27,43.17 L 39.90,47.03 M 39.90,47.03 L 83.50,52.86 L 63.31,42.15 L 60.40,25.99 M 60.40,25.99 L 55.27,43.17"/>`
- Commands: `M`, `L`, `M`, `L`, `L`, `L`, `M`, `L`
- Multiple `M` commands, but endpoints align to form a closed polygon.
- Only straight lines, 5 unique vertices.
- **Conclusion:** pentagon.

Answer questions about causal attribution by rigorously following this structured reasoning process:

1.  **Identify the Causal Rule:** Define the specific outcome and the explicit mechanism from the scenario that produces it. This rule is your ground truth.
2.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test (The Primary Determinant):** Ask "Would the outcome have occurred if the agent had NOT performed the specific action in question?"
    *   If **No**, the action is a cause. Proceed to step 3.
    *   If **Yes**, the action is not a cause. Conclude 'No'. **Trust this result.**
3.  **Check for Pre-emption (The Timeline Test):** Was the outcome already inevitable *before* the action took place? If a prior event had already guaranteed the outcome, the action is redundant and not causal. Conclude 'No'.
4.  **Distinguish Cause from Condition:** Determine if the action was the **active, decisive intervention** (the factor that made the difference) or merely a **passive, necessary condition** (a procedural step or formality that did not alter the outcome). If it is only a condition, it is not a cause. Conclude 'No'.
5.  **Align with the Specific Question:** Map your causal conclusion to the exact wording of the question. Carefully distinguish between *causing* an outcome (mechanistic), *intentionally causing* it (psychological), or *being responsible* for it (moral/legal).
6.  **Ignore Incidental Information:** Base reasoning strictly on the causal mechanism. Disregard all morally charged details, lucky outcomes, potential alternatives, legality, character judgments, or intentions that do not directly affect the causal link. **Be mechanistic.**

**Key Strategies for Success:**
-   **Anchor rigidly on the stated causal rule.** It is the foundation for all tests.
-   **The counterfactual test is decisive.** A "Yes" (outcome would have happened anyway) is a strong, often terminal indicator to conclude 'No'.
-   **Find the difference-maker.** The cause is the active intervention that changed the outcome, not a redundant condition.
-   **Answer the question asked.** Do not conflate causation with intent or responsibility.

**Output your final answer within <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer> tags.**

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution. Analyze each question carefully by following these structured steps:

### Step 1: Clarify the Question & Outcome
- Precisely identify the **specific outcome** being attributed.
- Identify the **specific action or omission** being evaluated as its cause.

### Step 2: Determine the Context of Attribution
- **Intention Questions** (e.g., "intentionally," "meant to"): Focus strictly on whether the outcome was part of the agent's goal or plan. **Crucially distinguish** between an **intended goal** (desired outcome) and a **foreseen side effect** (known but not desired). An effect is intentional only if it was pursued as an end or a means.
- **Causation Questions** (e.g., "caused," "because"): Apply the full causal analysis below. **Ignore intention and knowledge** for causation questions.

### Step 3: Apply Causal Tests (Prioritize Counterfactual)
- **Counterfactual Test (Necessity):** Would the outcome have occurred differently without the action? This is your primary test. A negative result strongly suggests no causation, unless overdetermination applies.
- **Causal Process:** Was the action part of the actual sequence leading to the outcome?
- **Normative Salience:** Did the action violate a norm or duty? (Most relevant for omissions)
- **Pragmatic Salience:** Within the narrative, is this action the most relevant or salient factor?

### Step 4: Handle Special Cases with Precision
- **Omissions:** An omission can be a cause **only if there was a duty or norm to act**. Otherwise, it is not causal.
- **Overdetermination:** An action can be a cause even if not strictly necessary if it was a sufficient and salient part of the causal story (e.g., accelerated timing of outcome).
- **Side Effects vs. Intentions:** Do not equate knowledge with intention. Use the test: "Was the outcome part of the agent's goal?" If not, it is a side effect.

### Critical Examples to Remember:
- **Henchman Example:** An agent who knows harm will occur but does not desire it acts unintentionally. Answer: <answer>No</answer> to "intentionally?"
- **Watch Example:** An agent's omission to act, when they have a duty to preserve a state, can be causal. Answer: <answer>Yes</answer> to "caused by not acting?"
- **Kate's Omission Example:** Without a duty to act, an omission is not causal. Answer: <answer>No</answer>

### Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude
Weigh the results from above. For intention, the outcome must have been a goal. For cause, decide if the action was a necessary and/or salient part of the causal story.

After thorough analysis, conclude with a final answer wrapped in <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer> tags.

**Key Reasoning Strategies to Apply:**
1. Always start with precise outcome/action identification
2. Use counterfactual as primary test for causation
3. For omissions, always check for duty to act
4. Separate causation from intention and knowledge
5. Handle overdetermination: acceleration or salience can establish causation
6. Conclude explicitly with required tags

Name the geometric shape drawn by the SVG path. Follow these steps:

1. **Parse the path**:
   - Extract all distinct points from M and L commands. Ignore redundant M commands that start at the previous endpoint.
   - For A (arc) commands, note rx, ry, rotation, and flags. If rx = ry, it indicates a circular arc.

2. **Check closure**:
   - The path is closed if it ends with Z or if the endpoint equals the start point (within Â±0.1 tolerance).
   - For multiple subpaths, the shape is closed only if the final point connects back to the initial start point.

- Compute dot products for right angles: |v1Â·v2| < 0.1

Options: circle, heptagon, hexagon, kite, line, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, triangle, trapezoid, ellipse
 Use a relaxed tolerance of 0.05 for dot products (angles) to account for near-right angles.
- For parallelism, check if the cross product magnitude of two vectors is â‰¤ 0.01.

Identify the geometric shape from the SVG path. Follow these steps meticulously:

1.  **Parse and Normalize Vertices:**
    *   Process all commands sequentially to generate a list of **absolute** coordinates. Convert any relative commands (lowercase `l`, `h`, `v`, `a`) to absolute.
    *   The initial `M` (or `m`) defines the first vertex.
    *   For each subsequent `L` (or `l`), `H` (or `h`), `V` (or `v`), or the endpoint of an `A` (or `a`) command, add a new vertex.
    *   **Crucial: Deduplicate consecutive points.** If a command's endpoint is identical to the current point (within a tolerance of 0.01), do not add a new vertex. The `Z` (or `z`) command does not add a vertex; it signifies a line back to the first vertex. The final vertex list must not include the starting point twice.
    *   **If multiple subpaths exist**, check if they form a continuous loop by comparing endpoints (within 0.01). If connected end-to-end, combine into one polygon.

2.  **Check if Path is Closed:**
    *   The path is closed if the final command is `Z`/`z`, or if the final endpoint is approximately equal (within 0.01) to the starting point `M`. If not closed, output "line".

3.  **Check for Arcs (A or a command):**
    *   If the path contains **exactly one** arc command and the entire path consists of **exactly three segments** (e.g., a straight line, the arc, and another straight line all meeting at a common center point), then output "sector".
    *   If the path contains **multiple arcs** that together form a full circle (e.g., two arcs each of approximately 180Â° with the same center and radius), output "circle".

4.  **For Closed Paths (Polygons):**
    *   Let `N` be the number of unique vertices in the list from Step 1. This is the number of sides.
    *   **N=3:** triangle.
    *   **N=4:** quadrilateral. Perform these checks **in order**:
        *   **Calculate Vectors:** For each side, compute the vector from vertex `i` to vertex `i+1`.
        *   **Check for Parallelism:** Two vectors `V1` and `V2` are parallel if `V1` is a scalar multiple of `V2` (i.e., the ratios of their x and y components are equal within 0.01 tolerance).
        *   **Check for Right Angles:** For each vertex, compute the dot product of the two adjacent side vectors. To determine if the angle is 90Â°, calculate the **normalized dot product**: `(V_i Â· V_j) / (|V_i| * |V_j|)`. If the absolute value of this result is less than `0.01` for all four vertices, the shape has right angles.
        *   **Check Side Lengths:** Calculate the squared Euclidean distance (`dxÂ² + dyÂ²`) for each side.
        *   **Decision Tree:**
            *   If the shape has two pairs of parallel sides (opposite sides parallel):
                *   If it also has right angles:
                    *   If all four sides are equal (squared distances equal within 0.01 tolerance), output "square" (if an option), else output "rectangle".
                *   Else, if all four sides are equal, output "rhombus".
                *   Else, output "parallelogram".
            *   Else if the shape has exactly one pair of parallel sides, output "trapezoid".
            *   Else if the shape has two distinct pairs of adjacent sides with equal lengths (within 0.01 tolerance), output "kite".
            *   Otherwise, output "quadrilateral".
    *   **N=5:** pentagon.
    *   **N=6:** hexagon.
    *   **N=7:** heptagon.
    *   **N=8:** octagon.

Options: [circle, heptagon, hexagon, kite, line, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, triangle]
Reasoning: The final `L 31.00,73.00` connects back to the start, so the path is closed. The list of unique, deduplicated vertices is: (31,73), (40,50), (55,53), (49,40), (77,50), (64,57), (64,76). This is 7 vertices, so it is a heptagon.

`, `recognizes`, `understands`) and their subjects in both Premise and Hypothesis. Note the exact nesting order of clauses and agents. This step is mandatory and must be performed explicitly.

2.  **Check for reversal:** Compare the hierarchy of agents. If the order of subjects is reversed between Premise and Hypothesis (e.g., Premise: `A verb1 that B verb2 X` vs. Hypothesis: `B verb2 that A verb1 X`), this is a primary indicator of **non-entailment**. If reversal is present, conclude `non-entailment`.

3.  **Classify verb types:**
    - **Non-factive (opaque) verbs:** `believes`, `thinks`, `assumes`, `suspects`. These do **not** imply the truth of their embedded clause.
    - **Factive (truth-entailing) verbs:** `knows`, `sees`, `understands`, `recognizes`. These imply the agent believes the proposition **and that it is true**.

4.  **Apply logical rules:**
    - **Axiom 1 (Opacity):** `A [non-factive verb] that [clause]` entails **nothing** about the truth of the embedded clause.
    - **Axiom 2 (Factivity):** `A [factive verb] that [clause]` entails that the entire embedded clause is **true**, regardless of the verbs inside it.
    - **Axiom 3 (No Reversal):** `A verb1 that B verb2 X` does **not** entail `B verb2 that A verb1 X`.

5.  **CRITICAL DECISION FLOW:** Answer these questions in order:

Determine whether the Premise logically entails the Hypothesis by following these reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify Structure:** Parse the Premise and Hypothesis to identify all subjects and their attitude verbs (e.g., `believes, knows, assumes, suspects, thinks, sees, remembers, understands`).

2.  **Classify Verbs:**
    -   **Factive Verbs (presuppose truth):** `knows, sees, remembers, realizes, understands, is aware that, discovered, regrets`.
    -   **Non-Factive Verbs (do not presuppose truth):** `believes, assumes, suspects, thinks, imagines, doubts`.

3.  **Apply Logical Rules:** For a Premise of the form "A **{verb1}** that B **{verb2}** that X":
    -   **Rule 1 (No Reverse Transfer):** The Premise **does not entail** "B **{verb2}** that X" **unless {verb1}** is **factive**.
    -   **Rule 2 (Belief Transfer):** The Premise entails "A **{verb1}** that X" **only if {verb2}** is **factive**.
    -   **Rule 3 (World Truth):** The Premise entails "X" **only if both {verb1}** and **{verb2}** are **factive**.

4.  **Conclude:** Based on the rules above, if the Premise forces the Hypothesis to be true, answer `entailment`. Otherwise, answer `non-entailment`.

**Quick Decision Guide:**
-   Hypothesis = "B **{verb2}** that X" â†’ Entailment **iff {verb1}** is factive.
-   Hypothesis = "A **{verb1}** that X" â†’ Entailment **iff {verb2}** is factive.
-   Hypothesis = "X" â†’ Entailment **iff both** verbs are factive.
-   Otherwise, **non-entailment**.

**Task:** Perform Natural Language Inference. Determine if the PREMISE entails the HYPOTHESIS. Your answer must be either "entailment" or "non-entailment".

**Key Reasoning Steps:**
1.  **Simplify:** Break down both sentences into their core propositions, explicitly identifying all agents and their attributed mental states. Ignore stylistic differences.
2.  **Check Factivity:** Identify the main verbs.
    - **Factive verbs** (e.g., *know, remember, see, realize*) imply the truth of their complement clause.
    - **Non-factive verbs** (e.g., *think, believe, suspect, assume*) do not imply truth; they express belief or opinion.
3.  **Track Perspectives (CRITICAL):** Entailment must respect the **scope and direction** of mental states. Apply these invariants:
    - **The Perspective Invariant:** A statement about Agent A's mental state **does NOT entail** a statement about Agent B's mental state. The beliefs of different agents are logically independent.
    - **The Directionality Rule:** A premise "A verbs1 that B verbs2 that P" does **NOT** entail a hypothesis "B verbs2 that A verbs1 that P". The direction of attribution cannot be reversed.
    - A factive statement about B's mental state establishes that mental state as a fact from the speaker's perspective.
4.  **Check Logical Containment:** If the premise and hypothesis describe the **same agent's** mental state, check if the hypothesis is a logical component or generalization of the premise's content. This is the only scenario where containment typically leads to entailment.
5.  **Final Judgment:** You must find a logical guarantee, not just a possibility. If the truth of the premise **guarantees** the truth of the hypothesis in every possible scenario, answer "entailment". If there is **any** scenario where the premise is true but the hypothesis is false, answer "non-entailment".

**Examples for Guidance:**
- **Example 1 (Cross-Agent, Non-Entailment):**
  Premise: Abigail sees that Sophia thinks that a group of female athletes are huddled together.
  Hypothesis: Sophia thinks that Abigail sees that a group of female athletes are huddled together.
  Analysis: The premise and hypothesis involve different agents and reverse the direction of mental states. The perspective invariant applies.
  Answer: `<answer>non-entailment</answer>`

- **Example 2 (Same-Agent, Entailment):**
  Premise: Joseph assumes that a man is jumping up in the air and splitting his legs.
  Hypothesis: Joseph assumes that a man is jumping.
  Analysis: Both share the same agent (Joseph) and mental state (assumption). The hypothesis is a logical component of the premise.

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution. Analyze each question carefully by following these structured steps:

### Step 1: Clarify the Question & Outcome
- Precisely identify the **specific outcome** being attributed.
- Identify the **specific action or omission** being evaluated as its cause.
- **Identify the Implicit Contrast:** Determine what the causal question is likely contrasting (e.g., "because of A" vs. "because of B"). Use narrative cues like "unlikely" or "likely" to identify this contrast.

### Step 2: Determine the Context of Attribution
- **Intention Questions** (e.g., "intentionally," "meant to"): Focus strictly on whether the outcome was part of the agent's goal or plan. **Crucially distinguish** between an **intended goal** (desired outcome) and a **foreseen side effect** (known but not desired). An effect is intentional only if it was pursued as an end or a means.
- **Causation Questions** (e.g., "caused," "because"): Apply the full causal analysis below. **Ignore intention and knowledge** for causation questions.

### Step 3: Apply Causal Tests (Prioritize Pragmatic Salience for "Because" Questions)
- **Counterfactual Test (Necessity):** Would the outcome have occurred differently without the action? A positive result indicates the action was a *necessary condition*, but **this does not automatically mean it is the correct answer to the causal question**. Use this result in conjunction with other tests.
- **Causal Process:** Was the action part of the actual sequence leading to the outcome?
- **Normative Salience:** Did the action violate a norm or duty? (Most relevant for omissions)
- **Pragmatic Salience (The "Why?" Test):** This is often the decisive test for "because" questions. Analyze the narrative to determine the most explanatory cause:
  - **Contrast:** What is the question implicitly contrasting?
  - **Normality & Likelihood:** Was the action/result normal/expected or abnormal/surprising? **An unlikely event is typically more salient than a likely one.**
  - **Expertise:** What would an expert point to as the key reason? What is the "interesting" part of the story?
  - **For conjunctive (AND) causes:** If one cause was highly probable and another highly improbable, the improbable cause is almost always the salient one referred to by "because."

### Step 4: Handle Special Cases with Precision
- **Omissions:** An omission can be a cause **only if there was a duty or norm to act**. Otherwise, it is not causal.
- **Overdetermination:** An action can be a cause even if not strictly necessary if it was a sufficient and salient part of the causal story (e.g., accelerated timing of outcome).
- **Side Effects vs. Intentions:** Do not equate knowledge with intention. U2025-09-09 23:30:52,187 - ðŸ“Š Current Template_description:

**Task:** Perform Natural Language Inference. Determine if the PREMISE entails the HYPOTHESIS. Your answer must be either "entailment" or "non-entailment". Follow these steps rigidly.

**Key Reasoning Steps:**
1.  **Simplify:** Identify the core propositions: `Agent Verb [that Complement]`.
2.  **Check Factivity (CRITICAL STEP):** Isolate the main verb of the premise.
    - **Factive verbs** (e.g., *know, remember, see, realize, learn*) **assert the truth** of their complement clause.
    - **Non-factive verbs** (e.g., *think, believe, assume, suspect*) **only describe a belief**; they do **not** guarantee the truth of their complement.
3.  **Track Perspectives (AGENT INVARIANCE):** Identify the agents. Mental states are **bound to their agents** and are **not transferable**.
    - A factive statement about B's mental state establishes that mental state as true.
    - A statement about A's belief regarding B's mental state does **not** entail anything about B's actual mental state.
    - **DIFFERENT AGENTS?** -> Default to *non-entailment*.
4.  **Check Logical Containment:** If the premise's truth guarantees the hypothesis's truth based on steps 2 and 3, then entailment holds. **CRITICAL: Do not use world knowledge;** rely only on logical structure and verb factivity. Ask: "Is there any possible scenario where the premise is true but the hypothesis is false?"
5.  **Final Judgment:** If the truth of the premise **must** make the hypothesis true, answer "entailment". If there is **any possible scenario** where the premise is true but the hypothesis is false, answer "non-entailment".

**Decision Rules:**
- **Main verb is FACTIVE?** -> The embedded clause is TRUE. Often leads to *entailment* if the hypothesis matches it directly.
- **Main verb is NON-FACTIVE?** -> The embedded clause is NOT asserted. Almost always leads to *non-entailment*.
- **Agents are DIFFERENT?** -> *Non-entailment* (unless a factive verb in the premise logically connects them, which is rare).
- **Nested beliefs?** -> Beliefs about beliefs do not entail direc2025-09-09 23:33:23,068 - ðŸ“Š Current Template_description:

Answer questions about causal attribution by rigorously following this structured reasoning process:

**Interpretation of 'Cause':** For this task, "cause" refers to **salient and responsible causation**. It asks whether the agent's action was a principal, fault-bearing, or decisive factor in bringing about the outcome, not merely a mechanistic link. Prioritize normative and intentional cues over pure physical necessity when they conflict.

1.  **Identify the Outcome and Causal Mechanism:** Precisely define the outcome in question and the general rule or mechanism that produces it (e.g., "If A and B, then C").

2.  **Establish the Actual Sequence and Context:** List the specific events that occurred, in order. Identify any relevant normative frameworks (e.g., policies, laws, standard procedures) that define expected behavior.

3.  **Check for Normative Deviance (The 'Fault' Filter):** If the scenario involves a violation of a stated policy, law, or standard procedure, identify the deviant agent.
    *   If the agent in question acted in full compliance with the norms and another agent's deviation created the dangerous situation, then the compliant agent is **not** considered the cause. Conclude 'No'.
    *   **Exception:** Do not apply this filter if the compliant agent's action was reckless or unreasonable given the information they actually had.

4.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test for Necessity:** Ask "Would the outcome have occurred **at the time and in the manner that it did** if the specific agent had NOT performed the action (or omission) in question?"
    *   **For Actions:** If the agent had not acted, would the outcome have been prevented? If **No**, the action is a *necessary cause*. Proceed to step 5.
    *   **For Omissions:** If the agent had performed the omitted action, would the outcome have been prevented? If **No**, the omission is a *necessary cause*. Proceed to step 5.
    *   If **Yes**, the action/omission is not necessary. Proceed to step 6 to check for other causal roles.

5.  **Check for Pre-emption (Inevitability):** Was the outcome already inevitable *before* the agent's action/omission? Was a sufficient condition for the outcome already permanently in place and unchangeable? If yes, the action is redundant. Conclude 'No'.

6.  **Check for Causal Sufficiency and Salience (The "Why This Outcome?" Test):** An action can be a cause even if not strictly necessary.
    *   **For Omissions in Overdetermined Scenarios:** If a sufficient condition for the outcome was already present, and the agent's omission was to *allow that condition to persist*, then the omission can be considered a cause. The question is often interpreted as asking if the state of the world the agent permitted was a cause.
    *   **For Overdetermination (Multiple Sufficient Causes):** If multiple factors were each sufficient to cause the outcome, then **each sufficient factor that was present and actively relied upon is considered a cause.** The question is likely asking if this agent was one of the causes.
    *   **Reinforcement of Normative Deviance:** If not already applied in Step 3, consider if the agent's action, while necessary, was a compliant response to a deviant situation created by others. If so, their action is typically not the salient cause.

7.  **For Questions About Intention:** The question "Did X intentionally cause Y?" is stricter than "Did X cause Y?".
    *   Conclude 'Yes' for intentional causation **only if** the outcome Y was part of the agent's goal state (their desired end) or an intended means to that end.
    *   Conclude 'No' if the outcome was merely a foreseen but unwanted side effect to which the agent was indifferent. Do not equate knowledge or foresight with intention.

8.  **Align with the Specific Question:** Map your conclusion to the exact wording of the question. Final answers must be based strictly on the causal analysis above.

9.  **Ignore Truly Incidental Information:** Disregard morally charged language, lucky outcomes, or character judgments that do not directly affect the causal mechanism, normative context, or the definition of intention.

**Consider the following examples to avoid common failures:**

*   **Example A (Omission & Overdetermination):** "Did David's clothes dry because he did not change the temperature?" -> **Yes**. The HIGH setting was a sufficient condition that David knowingly allowed to persist. The outcome was overdetermined, but his omission preserved a cause.
*   **Example B (Normative Deviance):** "Did Alice cause the email to be sent?" -> **No**. Zoe's policy violation created the dangerous situation. Alice's compliant action, though mechanically necessary, is not the salient cause.

e main verbs.
    - **Factive verbs** (e.g., *know, remember, see, realize*) imply the truth of their complement clause from the speaker's perspective.
    - **Non-factive verbs** (e.g., *think, believe, suspect, assume*) do not imply truth; they express belief or opinion.
3.  **Track Perspectives (CRITICAL):** Entailment must respect the **scope and direction** of mental states. Apply these invariants:
    - **The Perspective Invariant:** A statement about Agent A's mental state **does NOT entail** a statement about Agent B's mental state. The beliefs of different agents are logically independent.
    - **The Directionality Rule:** A premise "A verbs1 that B verbs2 that P" does **NOT** entail a hypothesis "B verbs2 that A verbs1 that P". The direction of attribution cannot be reversed.
    - A factive statement about B's mental state establishes that mental state as a fact from the speaker's perspective.
4.  **Check Semantic Containment (IMPROVED):** If the premise and hypothesis describe the **same agent's** mental state, analyze the relationship between the core propositions (P and Q).
    - **Use Commonsense Meaning:** Interpret all words and phrases according to their standard meanings in everyday language. Do not invent unusual or implausible definitions (e.g., an "indoor yard") to create counterexamples.
    - **Determine if P entails Q:** Ask: "If proposition P is true, does it **guarantee** that proposition Q is true, based on standard word meanings and commonsense facts?"
    - **If P entails Q,** then "A suspects P" entails "A suspects Q". Similarly, "A knows P" entails "A knows Q".
    - **If P does not entail Q,** then the overall entailment fails.
5.  **Final Judgment:** You must find a logical guarantee based on **standard linguistic and commonsense reasoning**. If the truth of the premise **guarantees** the truth of the hypothesis in every **plausible** scenario, answer "entailment". If there is **any plausible scenario consistent with the standard meanings of the words** where the premise is true but the hypothesis is false, answer "non-entailment".

- **Example 1 (Cross-Agent, Non-Entailment):**
  Premise: Abigail sees that Sophia thinks that a group of female athletes are huddled together.
  Hypothesis: Sophia thinks that Abigail sees that a group of female athletes are huddled together.
  Analysis: The premise and hypothesis involve different agents and reverse the direction of mental states. The perspective invariant applies.
  Answer: `<answer>non-entailment</answer>`

- **Example 2 (Same-Agent, Entailment):**
  Premise: Joseph assumes that a man is jumping up in the air and splitting his legs.
  Hypothesis: Joseph assumes that a man is jumping.
  Analysis: Both share the same agent (Joseph) and mental state (assumption). The hypothesis is a logical component of the premise based on commonsense meaning.
  Answer: `<answer>entailment</answer>`

- **Example 3 (Same-Agent, Semantic Entailment - CRITICAL):**
  Premise: Robert suspects that three adults are working in a garden near a fence in the yard.
  Hypothesis: Robert suspects that the three adults are outside in the garden.
  Analysis: Same agent (Robert) and mental state (suspects). The core proposition P ("in a garden near a fence in the yard") semantically entails Q ("outside in the garden") because a "yard" is, by standard definition, an outdoor area. Therefore, suspecting P entails suspecting Q.
  Answer: `<answer>entailment</answer>`

- **Example 4 (Same-Agent, Non-Entailment - Semantic):**
  Premise: David believes the cat is on the mat.
  Hypothesis: David believes the cat is asleep.
  Analysis: Same agent and mental state. However, the core proposition P ("cat is on the mat") does not entail Q ("cat is asleep") based on commonsense meaning. A cat can be on a mat without being asleep.

2.  **Identify the Outcome:** Clearly state the specific event that occurred.
3.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test:** For the agent's specific action (or inaction) at the specific time, ask: "If this agent had not performed this exact action, would the outcome still have occurred **according to the mechanism from step 1**?"
    - If **no**, the action was a cause. Answer **Yes**.
    - If **yes**, it was not. Answer **No**.
4.  **Uphold Key Invariants:** Base your reasoning solely on the physical causal chain. **You must ignore:**
    - Permissions, policies, instructions, or social roles.
    - The agent's knowledge, intentions, beliefs, or goals.

Answer questions about causal attribution and intentionality by following this structured process:

1.  **Identify the specific outcome and alleged cause/intent.**
    *   Precisely define the outcome based on the question's wording (e.g., "premature death" vs. "death").
    *   Clearly state the alleged cause or intent in question.

2.  **Apply the counterfactual ("but-for") test for causation:** Ask "Would the outcome have occurred in the exact way and at the exact time it did if the alleged cause had been absent?" A cause can be necessary even as part of an interactive set of conditions.
    *   **Critical Rule:** If the outcome would have occurred anyway due to other sufficient conditions, the alleged cause is not necessary. Focus on necessity, not sufficiency or blame.

3.  **For questions about intentionality, analyze the agent's mental state:** Determine if the outcome was a desired goal or merely a known side effect. An agent does not act intentionally if they are indifferent to the outcome.
    *   If the question is only about causation, explicitly state that intentionality is not being evaluated.

4.  **Evaluate the causal role:** Consider if the cause was a direct action, a decision, an authorization, or an omission. Ignore any information that is emotionally charged but causally irrelevant to the specific outcome.

5.  **Synthesize:** Conclude based on the specific question.
    *   **For causation:** The answer is "Yes" **only if** the but-for test is satisfied for the precisely defined outcome.
    *   **For intentionality:** Determine if the agent acted to bring about the outcome.

Answer questions about causal attribution and intentionality by following this structured process:

1.  **Identify the specific outcome and alleged cause/intent.**
    *   Parse the question precisely. What is the exact outcome? Who is the specific agent? What is the specific action?

2.  **For questions involving causation, apply the counterfactual ("but-for") test:**
    *   Ask: "Would the outcome have occurred *exactly as it did* if the alleged cause had been absent?"
    *   **Key Rule:** If the answer is "yes" (the outcome would have happened anyway), then the alleged cause was **not a necessary factor**. If the answer is "no" (the outcome would not have happened), then the alleged cause **was a necessary factor**.

3.  **For questions about intentionality, analyze the agent's mental state:**
    *   **Knowledge:** Did the agent know their action would lead to the outcome?
    *   **Desire:** Was the outcome a desired goal of the agent?
    *   **Attitude:** If the outcome was not desired, was the agent indifferent to it, or did they accept it as a known consequence?
    *   **Key Decision Rule:** An agent acts **intentionally** if the outcome was (a) a desired goal, or (b) a known consequence to which the agent was indifferent or which they accepted. An agent does **not** act intentionally if they were unaware of the outcome or if they were opposed to it but caused it unavoidably.

4.  **Evaluate the causal role:**
    *   Consider the nature of the cause: Was it a direct action, a decision, an authorization, or an omission? This helps apply the counterfactual correctly.

5.  **Synthesize your analysis to conclude:**
    *   For causation: Conclude "Yes" only if the action was a necessary factor (passes the but-for test).
    *   For intentionality: Conclude "Yes" only if the agent had knowledge and either desire or indifference.
    *   Ensure your final answer directly addresses the specific question asked.

Answer questions about causation or intentionality by following this structured process:

1.  **Identify the Question Type:** First, determine if the question is about **causation** (e.g., "did X happen because of Y?") or **intentionality** (e.g., "did agent Z do X intentionally?"). Your analysis will focus on this specific question.

2.  **For Causation Questions: Apply the Counterfactual Test**
    *   Identify the outcome and the specific alleged cause.
    *   Apply the "but-for" test: Ask, "Would the outcome have occurred **exactly as it did** if the alleged cause had been **absent**?"
    *   If **No**, then the alleged cause was a necessary factor. Conclude <answer>Yes</answer>.
    *   If **Yes** (the outcome would have happened anyway), then it was not a cause. Conclude <answer>No</answer>. Ignore whether the action was sufficient; focus on necessity.

3.  **For Intentionality Questions: Analyze the Agent's Mental State**
    *   Identify the outcome and the agent's action.
    *   Determine if the outcome was the agent's **goal** or a **means to their goal**. If yes, conclude <answer>Yes</answer>.
    *   If not, determine if the outcome was a **foreseen side effect** to which the agent was **indifferent**. If yes, conclude <answer>No</answer>. An agent does not intend outcomes they are indifferent to.

4.  **Synthesize:** Provide a final answer of <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>. Keep reasoning concise and focused on the relevant test above.
ar entities (e.g., 'a piano,' 'a car'), assume the plural noun refers to a similar singular entity (e.g., one drum *set*, one *pair* of glasses, one *set* of tools) and apply the stated quantity to that entity.
6.  **Category Filtering:** If asked for a specific category (e.g., "vegetables"), use common culinary definitions. If unsure, you may state your assumption.

**Reasoning Steps:**
1.  **Identify Items:** Parse the input for every noun phrase that refers to a physical object.
2.  **Contextual Disambiguation:** Analyze the list for any ambiguous terms (e.g., "drums"). Compare them to other items to determine the most likely intended granularity. Note your assumption.
3.  **Assign Quantity:** For each phrase, assign a quantity based on Rules 1-5.
4.  **Filter (if needed):** If the question specifies a category, identify which items belong to that category.
5.  **Tally:** Sum the quantities of all identified items (or only the categorized items, if a filter is applied).
6.  **Output:** Provide your final count. If your reasoning relied on interpreting an ambiguity, state your assumption clearly (e.g., "Assuming 'three drums' means three drum sets...").

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

Input: "I have three apples and two oranges. How many fruits do I have?"
Reasoning: "three apples" = 3 items. "two oranges" = 2 items. All are fruits. Total items = 3 + 2 = 5.
Answer: 5

Input: "I have a head of broccoli and a banana. How many vegetables?"
Reasoning: "a head of broccoli" = 1 vegetable (the head is the described unit). "a banana" = 1 fruit (not a vegetable). Total vegetables = 1.
Answer: 1

**Examples of Ambiguity Resolution:**

Input: "I have a piano, three drums, and a guitar. How many musical instruments?"
Reasoning: "a piano" = 1 instrument. "a guitar" = 1 instrument. The term "drums" is ambiguous. Given the context of listing large, singular instruments, it is most likely the user means three drum *sets*. "three drums" = 3 instruments. Total instruments = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5.
Answer: Assuming "drums" refers to drum sets, the count is 5.

Input: "I have a car, a truck, and two motorcycles. How many vehicles?"
Reasoning: "a car" = 1 vehicle. "a truck" = 1 vehicle. "two motorcycles" = 2 vehicles (each is a distinct vehicle, similar to the car and truck). Total vehicles = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
Answer: 4

You are an expert at precise counting and aggregation. The user will describe a collection of items. Your task is to count the total number of individual physical objects mentioned, carefully accounting for stated quantities and context.

**Critical Rules:**
1.  **Use Explicit Numbers:** "three apples" = 3 items.
2.  **Articles Imply ONE:** "a", "an", "the", or phrases like "a head of" indicate 1 item for the described unit.
3.  **Assume Singular:** An unquantified distinct object (e.g., "carrot") = 1 item.
4.  **Granularity:** Count items **as described, not their components.** A "bunch of grapes" is 1 item. Do not break down composite objects.
5.  **Contextual Unit Interpretation:** If an item is typically consumed, sold, or grouped as a unit (e.g., grapes, berries, bananas), interpret "a [noun]" as referring to one standard unit (e.g., "a grape" = 1 bunch; "a blackberry" = 1 berry). Use the context of other listed items to guide this.
6.  **Robust List Parsing:** The input may be ungrammatical. Split the text by commas and the word "and". A new noun phrase is often signaled by an article (a, an, the) or a number. For example, "a microwave an oven" contains two items: "a microwave" and "an oven".
7.  **Category Filtering:** If a category is specified (e.g., "fruits"), use common real-world knowledge to include/exclude items. State assumptions if unsure.

**Reasoning Steps (You MUST follow these):**
1.  **Parse the Input:** Carefully split the user's description into distinct noun phrases using commas and "and" as separators. Pay close attention to articles and numbers as signals for a new phrase.
2.  **List Items:** Identify every parsed noun phrase referring to a physical object.
3.  **Assign Quantities:** For each phrase, assign a number based on rules 1-3. Then, apply rule 5 to interpret ambiguous units based on context.
4.  **Filter:** If asked for a category, determine which items belong to it.
5.  **Tally:** Sum the quantities of all relevant items.
6.  **Output:** State your reasoning explicitly, then provide the final count.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

Input: "I have a drum, a plum, a blackberry, a trumpet, and an orange. How many musical instruments?"
Reasoning: **Parse:** Items are "a drum", "a plum", "a blackberry", "a trumpet", "an orange". **Assign:** "a drum" = 1 (instrument). "a plum" = 1 (fruit, exclude). "a blackberry" = 1 (fruit, exclude). "a trumpet" = 1 (instrument). "an orange" = 1 (fruit, exclude). **Tally:** Total instruments = 1 + 1 = 2.
Answer: 2

Input: "I have two pianos, an accordion, and a violin. How many objects?"
Reasoning: **Parse:** Items are "two pianos", "an accordion", "a violin". **Assign:** "two pianos" = 2. "an accordion" = 1. "a violin" = 1. **Tally:** Total objects = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.
Answer: 4

**Examples Avoiding Common Failures:**

Input: "I have two oranges, an apple, a peach, a plum, a grape, a blackberry, two raspberries, and a banana. How many fruits do I have?"
Reasoning: **Parse:** Items are "two oranges", "an apple", "a peach", "a plum", "a grape", "a blackberry", "two raspberries", "a banana". **Assign/Context:** "two oranges" = 2. "an apple" = 1. "a peach" = 1. "a plum" = 1. "a grape" = 1 (interpreted as one unit/bunch of grapes). "a blackberry" = 1 (interpreted as one blackberry unit). "two raspberries" = 2. "a banana" = 1. **Filter:** All are fruits. **Tally:** 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 10.
Answer: 10

Input: "I have a lamp, a microwave, a table, a fridge, a stove, four beds, a toaster, an oven, two couches, and a chair. How many objects?"
Reasoning: **Parse:** Items are "a lamp", "a microwave", "a table", "a fridge", "a stove", "four beds", "a toaster", "an oven", "two couches", "a chair". **Assign:** "a lamp"=1, "a microwave"=1, "a table"=1, "a fridge"=1, "a stove"=1, "four beds"=4, "a toaster"=1, "an oven"=1, "two couches"=2, "a chair"=1. **Tally:** 1+1+1+1+1+4+1+1+2+1 = 14.
Answer: 14

Now, apply this precise reasoning to the following question. Think step by step.

You are an expert at precise counting and aggregation. The user will describe a collection of items. Your task is to count the total number of individual physical objects mentioned, carefully accounting for stated quantities.

**Critical Rules for Interpretation:**
1.  **Explicit Quantities:** Always use the number directly stated (e.g., "three yams" = 3 items).
2.  **Articles imply ONE:** The articles "a," "an," or "the," and phrases like "a stalk of" or "a head of" indicate a quantity of 1 for the described unit.
3.  **Assume Singular:** If no quantity is mentioned for a distinct object, assume a quantity of 1.
4.  **Granularity Rule (MOST IMPORTANT):** Count the item **exactly as described by the user, not its components.** A "head of broccoli" is one item. A "bunch of grapes" is one item. A "garlic" is one bulb. **Never break down composite items.**
5.  **Category Filtering:** If asked for a specific category (e.g., "vegetables"), use common culinary definitions. If unsure, you may state your assumption.

**Reasoning Steps (MUST FOLLOW):**
1.  **Parse the List:** Carefully extract every single item from the user's input. Pay extremely close attention to commas and the word "and" to ensure you capture **every** mentioned object. Write out the *full, raw phrase* for each item (e.g., "two bananas").
2.  **Assign Quantity:** For each extracted phrase, assign a quantity based on Rules 1-3.
3.  **Verify Completeness:** Count the number of items you have identified. Double-check this number against the user's original list to ensure no item was missed or double-counted. This step is **critical**.
4.  **Filter (if needed):** If the question specifies a category, identify which items belong to that category.
5.  **Tally:** Sum the quantities of all identified items (or only the categorized items, if a filter is applied).
6.  **Verify Arithmetic:** Double-check your addition to ensure there are no calculation errors. This step is **critical**.
7.  **Output:** Provide your final count in the format `<answer>N</answer>`.

**Examples of Correct Granularity:**
- "a head of lettuce" = 1 item
- "a garlic" = 1 item (one bulb)
- "four cabbages" = 4 items
- "a carrot" = 1 item

**Examples of Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- **Input:** "I have a strawberry, a grape, a trombone, a nectarine, two bananas, three oranges, an apple, a plum, a clarinet, three blackberries, and an accordion."
  - **Pitfall:** Missing the final item ("an accordion") in the initial identification step. **Remember Step 3 (Verify Completeness).**

You are an expert at precise counting and aggregation. The user will describe a collection of items. Your task is to count the total number of individual physical objects mentioned, carefully accounting for stated quantities and resolving ambiguities.

**Critical Rules for Interpretation:**
1.  **Explicit Quantities:** Always use the number directly stated (e.g., "three yams" = 3 items).
2.  **Articles imply ONE:** The articles "a," "an," or "the," and phrases like "a stalk of" or "a head of" indicate a quantity of 1 for the described unit.
3.  **Assume Singular:** If no quantity is mentioned for a distinct object, assume a quantity of 1.
4.  **Granularity Rule:** Count the item **as described by the user, not its components.** A "head of broccoli" is one physical item. A "bunch of grapes" is one item. A "stalk of celery" is one item. Do not break down composite items into smaller parts.
5.  **Ambiguous Plurals:** For plural nouns that commonly represent a collection of items (e.g., 'drums,' 'tools,' 'glasses'), interpret them based on the context of the other items listed. If other items are singular entities (e.g., 'a piano,' 'a car'), assume the plural noun refers to a similar singular entity (e.g., one drum *set*, one *pair* of glasses, one *set* of tools) and apply the stated quantity to that entity.
6.  **Ambiguous Singular Units:** For singular nouns that can represent a composite item (e.g., 'a garlic,' 'a celery'), use the context of the other listed items to determine the intended granularity. If all other items are singular, discrete units (e.g., 'a carrot,' 'an onion'), assume the ambiguous term also refers to a single discrete unit (e.g., one garlic *clove*, one celery *stalk*). If no clear context exists, state your assumption.
7.  **Category Filtering:** If asked for a specific category (e.g., "vegetables"), use common culinary definitions. If unsure, you may state your assumption.

**Reasoning Steps:**
1.  **Identify Items:** Parse the input for every noun phrase that refers to a physical object.
2.  **Contextual Disambiguation:** Analyze the list for any ambiguous terms.
    - Check for ambiguous *plural* terms (e.g., "drums"). Compare them to other items to determine the most likely intended granularity.
    - **Crucially, check for ambiguous *singular* terms (e.g., "a garlic," "a celery") that might represent a composite item. Compare them to other items in the list to determine if the context implies a standard discrete unit.** Note your assumption.
3.  **Assign Quantity:** For each phrase, assign a quantity based on Rules 1-6.
4.  **Filter (if needed):** If the question specifies a category, identify which items belong to that category.
5.  **Tally:** Sum the quantities of all identified items (or only the categorized items, if a filter is applied).
6.  **Output:** Provide your final count. If your reasoning relied on interpreting an ambiguity, state your assumption clearly (e.g., "Assuming 'three drums' means three drum sets..." or "Assuming 'a garlic' means one clove...").

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

Input: "I have three apples and two oranges. How many fruits do I have?"
Reasoning: "three apples" = 3 items. "two oranges" = 2 items. All are fruits. Total items = 3 + 2 = 5.
Answer: 5

Input: "I have a head of broccoli and a banana. How many vegetables?"
Reasoning: "a head of broccoli" = 1 vegetable (the head is the described unit). "a banana" = 1 fruit (not a vegetable). Total vegetables = 1.
Answer: 1

**Examples of Ambiguity Resolution:**

Input: "I have a piano, three drums, and a guitar. How many musical instruments?"
Reasoning: "a piano" = 1 instrument. "a guitar" = 1 instrument. The term "drums" is ambiguous. Given the context of listing large, singular instruments, it is most likely the user means three drum *sets*. "three drums" = 3 instruments. Total instruments = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5.
Answer: Assuming "drums" refers to drum sets, the count is 5.

Input: "I have a cauliflower, a lettuce head, an onion, three carrots, a stalk of celery, a yam, a garlic, a potato, and a head of broccoli. How many vegetables do I have?"
Reasoning:
1.  **Identify Items:** cauliflower, lettuce head, onion, carrots, celery stalk, yam, garlic, potato, broccoli head.
2.  **Contextual Disambiguation:** "a garlic" is ambiguous. It could be one bulb or one clove. The context is a list of individual vegetable units: heads, a stalk, single tubers. This strongly suggests "a garlic" is intended to mean a single clove, the standard discrete unit in this context.
3.  **Assign Quantity:** "a cauliflower"=1, "a lettuce head"=1, "an onion"=1, "three carrots"=3, "a stalk of celery"=1, "a yam"=1, "a garlic"=1 (clove), "a potato"=1, "a head of broccoli"=1.
4.  **Category Filtering:** All items are vegetables.
5.  **Tally:** 1+1+1+3+1+1+1+1+1 = 11.
Answer: 11 (Assuming "a garlic" refers to a single clove based on the context of other discrete items).

Now, apply this precise reasoning to the following question. Think step by step.
al
- CD and DA differ by 0.007 > Îµ_rel â†’ not equal
- Check symmetric pairs: AB=BC and no other equal pairs â†’ not a kite
- No parallel sides â†’ output "quadrilateral"
Output: `<answer>quadrilateral</answer>`

Example 2 (True Kite):
Path: `M 0,0 L 2,0 L 3,2 L 1,2 L 0,0`
- Vertices: 4 points
- Side lengths: AB=2, BC=âˆš5â‰ˆ2.236, CD=2, DA=âˆš5â‰ˆ2.236
- AB=CD and BC=DA â†’ two pairs of adjacent sides equal
Output: `<answer>kite</answer>`

Example 3 (Trapezoid with Parallel Sides):
Path: `M 0,0 L 4,0 L 3,2 L 1,2 L 0,0`
- AB = (4,0), CD = (-2,0) â†’ parallel (cross product â‰ˆ0)
Output: `<answer>trapezoid</answer>`

Example 4 (Global Collinearity Check):
Path: `M 0,0 L 1,1 L 2,2 L 3,3 L 0,0`
- All points lie on line y=x â†’ output `<answer>line</answer>`

Example 5 (Heptagon, Not Line):
Path: `M 31.00,73.00 L 40.00,50.00 L 55.00,53.00 L 49.00,40.00 L 77.00,50.00 L 64.00,57.00 L 64.00,76.00 L 31.00,73.00`
- 7 distinct vertices after removing duplicate start/end
- Points not globally collinear â†’ not a line
- 7 vertices â†’ output `<answer>heptagon</answer>`

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Do not use absolute tolerance for large coordinates; always use relative tolerance Îµ_rel
- For kites, check all possible adjacent side pairs, not just consecutive ones
- The final point closing the path does not create a new vertex if within Îµ of start
- Never output "trapezoid" for quadrilaterals without parallel sides
- For angle calculations, use vectors pointing away from the vertex
- Check global collinearity using area of triangle method: for points A, B, C, if area(ABC) â‰ˆ 0 for all triplets, then all points collinear
- If multiple subpaths exist, analyze only the first subpath for shape classification

You are an expert in computational geometry and SVG format. Your task is to identify the geometric shape drawn by an SVG path element by analyzing its vertices.

**Instructions:**
1. Parse the `<path d="...">` string carefully, converting all relative commands to absolute coordinates.
2. Extract the complete sequence of vertices that define the polygon:
   - Initialize an empty list for vertices.
   - Process each command sequentially:
     - For `M x,y` (absolute moveto):
       - If this is the first command, add (x,y) to vertices.
       - Otherwise, if (x,y) is not equal to the last vertex (within tolerance 0.001), add it. If equal, skip (it's a duplicate).
     - For `L x,y` (absolute lineto): 
       - Add (x,y) unless it equals the last vertex (within tolerance).
     - For `Z` (closepath):
       - Do not add a new vertex, but mark the path as closed.
   - For other commands (H, V, C, S, Q, T, A), convert to absolute and extract their endpoint(s), adding each unless it duplicates the previous vertex.
3. After processing all commands, check if the path is closed:
   - If it ends with `Z`, or if the last vertex equals the first vertex (within tolerance), it is closed.
4. If closed, ensure the first and last vertices are not duplicates:
   - If the last vertex equals the first (within tolerance), remove the last vertex.
5. Count the number of unique vertices in order (removing only consecutive duplicates).
6. Map the vertex count to a shape name:
   - 1: point
   - 2: line
   - 3: triangle
   - 4: quadrilateral
   - 5: pentagon
   - 6: hexagon
   - 7: heptagon
   - 8: octagon
   - etc.

You are an expert in computational geometry and SVG format. Your task is to identify the geometric shape drawn by an SVG path element by analyzing its structure and vertices.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Parse the entire path:** Extract all commands from the `<path d="...">` string. Ignore subpath boundaries (`M` commands) and treat the entire path as a single shape if it forms a closed contour.
2.  **Extract vertices:** 
      - Only `L` (lineto) commands create vertices.
      - For curve commands (`C`, `Q`, etc.), always add the endpoint as a vertex (since it defines a corner).
      - For arc commands (`A`), add the endpoint as a vertex unless the arc is degenerate (span â‰ˆ 0Â°).
      - Use tolerance Îµ=0.001 to merge duplicate points (round coordinates to 3 decimal places).
3.  **Check for closed path:** If the path ends with `Z` or the final point is within Îµ of the start, consider it closed. Otherwise, it is open.
4.  **Count unique vertices:** Remove duplicates within tolerance.
5.  **Classify the shape:**
      - If open path: 
            * 1 vertex: `<answer>point</answer>`
            * 2 vertices: `<answer>line</answer>`
            * â‰¥3 vertices: `<answer>polyline</answer>`
      - If closed path:
            * If all vertices collinear (area of triangle method with Îµ_rel=0.001 * max_distance): `<answer>line</answer>`
            * Else:
                  - 3 vertices: triangle
                  - 4 vertices: classify quadrilateral (see below)
                  - 5 vertices: pentagon
                  - 6 vertices: hexagon
                  - 7 vertices: heptagon
                  - 8 vertices: octagon
                  - Other: n-gon
6.  **Quadrilateral classification:**
      a. Compute side lengths (Euclidean distance) and angles (dot product of vectors).
      b. Use relative tolerance Îµ_rel = 0.001 * max_side_length.
      c. Check in order:
            - All angles â‰ˆ90Â° (dot product < Îµ_rel): "rectangle"
            - Both pairs of opposite sides parallel (cross product < Îµ_rel): "trapezoid"
            - One pair of sides parallel: "trapezoid"
            - Two distinct pairs of adjacent sides equal: "kite"
            - Else: "quadrilateral"
7.  **Handle curves specifically:**
      - If the path contains arc commands (`A`) with equal radii and the start point is the center of the arc, output `<answer>sector</answer>`.
      - If the path is a single arc spanning â‰ˆ360Â°, output `<answer>circle</answer>`.
8.  **Output:** `<answer>shape_name</answer>`

**Critical Examples to Guide Reasoning:**

Example 1 (Multi-Subpath Path):

- Entire path is closed (ends at start).
- Vertices: 6 distinct points.
- Output: `<answer>hexagon</answer>`

Example 2 (Arc-Based Path):
Path: `M 88.24,69.26 L 80.27,95.00 A 26.94,26.94 107.20 0,1 92.49,42.66 L 88.24,69.26`
- Start point is center of arc (distances â‰ˆ26.94).
- Contains arc and two straight lines.
- Output: `<answer>sector</answer>`

Example 3 (Collinear Points):
Path: `M 0,0 L 1,1 L 2,2 L 3,3 L 0,0`
- All points collinear.
- Output: `<answer>line</answer>`

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Do not analyze only the first subpath; consider the entire path.
- For curves, always add the endpoint as a vertex (unless degenerate).
- Use relative tolerance (Îµ_rel) for all geometric comparisons.
- For sectors, verify the start point is the center (distances to arc endpoints equal within Îµ).

Now, analyze the following question.
sed on a property (e.g., alphabetical order):** Generate the required sorted list from the final table, then find the entity in the first or last position.
3.  **For counting questions:** Check each entity. For compound conditions (AND), an entity must satisfy **all** conditions to be counted.
4.  **For arithmetic operations (e.g., sum):** First extract all relevant numerical values from the final table into a list. Then compute the result **step-by-step** (e.g., 5+10=15, 15+2=17, 17+9=26).
5.  **Provide a concise, step-by-step explanation** that includes your built table and your iterative checks before giving your final answer enclosed in <answer> tags.

Answer questions about tables of animals (e.g., penguins or giraffes) and their attributes. Follow these steps precisely and without exception:

1.  **Build the Final Table:** Start with the original table for the animal mentioned. Process every modification instruction **in the exact order given**:
    *   **Add** any new entities (e.g., "We now add a...") by appending them to the end of the list.
    *   **Delete** any specified entities (e.g., "We then delete...") by removing the entity with that exact name.
    *   The resulting list of entities, in their strict order of appearance, is your **final table**. This is the only list you will use for reasoning. Ignore all other tables.

2.  **Iterate Through Every Entity:** For all questions, you must check each entity in your final table one by one. Do not assume or guess.
    *   **Lookup (e.g., "age of Bernard"):** Find the entity by name, then report its attribute.
    *   **Comparison (e.g., "older than Gwen"):** First, find the baseline entity's value. Then, for every other entity, check if its value satisfies the condition (e.g., greater than the baseline).
    *   **Superlative (e.g., "tallest"):** Extract the relevant value for every entity. Find the minimum or maximum value, then identify which entity has that value.
    *   **"First" or "Last":** Use the entity's position in the final table's order. The first entity is at the top, the last is at the bottom.
    *   **Counting:** For each entity, evaluate all conditions. An entity is only counted if it satisfies every condition (for AND). For OR, count if any condition is satisfied.
    *   **Arithmetic (e.g., sum):** First extract all relevant numerical values into a list from the final table. Then compute the result step-by-step.

3.  **Provide a Step-by-Step Explanation:** Your output must include:
    *   Your explicitly built final table (list all entities with their attributes).
    *   A record of your iterative checks for every entity (e.g., for counting: show each entity and whether it satisfies the conditions).
    *   Your final answer, enclosed in <answer> tags.

**Key Rule: The final table is sacred. You must iterate through every entity in it. There are no shortcuts.**

*Step: Final table: Louis (age=7), Bernard (5), Vincent (9), Gwen (8). Extract ages: 7,5,9,8. Minimum is 5. Entity with age=5 is Bernard.*
<answer>Bernard</answer>
id extract:** "that Taylor assumes that a cement worker is outside"
    *   Hypothesis: Taylor assumes that a cement worker is outside.
    *   **Judgment: <answer>non-entailment</answer>** (The Hypothesis is a direct assertion about Taylor, not the content of Emma's belief. Emma could be wrong about what Taylor assumes).

*   **Example B (Entailment - Embedded Factive):**
    *   Premise: Richard believes that David remembers that a man is on a bench.
    *   **Main Verb:** `believes` (Non-Factive).
    *   **Embedded Verb:** `remembers` (Factive). -> **Two valid extracts:**
        1.  "that David remembers that a man is on a bench"
        2.  "that a man is on a bench"
    *   Hypothesis: Richard believes that a man is on a bench.
    *   **Judgment: <answer>entailment</answer>** (The Hypothesis matches the factive-entailed content. If Richard believes David *remembers* it, he must believe it is true).

*   **Example C (Entailment - Factive Main Verb):**
    *   Premise: Amelia knows that Thomas discovered that a man is lifting a shovel.
    *   **Main Verb:** `knows` (Factive). -> **Extract:** "a man is lifting a shovel"
    *   Hypothesis: Amelia knows that a man is lifting a shovel.
    *   **Judgment: <answer>entailment</answer>**

You are an expert in natural language inference (NLI). Your task is to determine if the Premise sentence logically entails the Hypothesis sentence.

**Definition:**
- **Entailment** means that if the Premise is true, then the Hypothesis must also be true. Your goal is to see if the truth of the Premise guarantees the truth of the Hypothesis.

**Crucial Guidelines for Analysis:**
1.  **Analyze Beliefs and Knowledge with Precision:** Pay extremely close attention to sentences about beliefs, thoughts, assumptions, knowledge, suspicions, and other mental states (e.g., "X assumes that...", "Y thinks that...", "Z knows that...").
    - **Critical Distinction:** A belief *about another person's belief* is NOT automatically a belief *about the world*. The premise may describe what one person assumes about another's thoughts without committing to the truth of those thoughts.
        - **Example:** "Thomas assumes that Emma thinks it is raining" **does not entail** "Thomas assumes it is raining." Thomas could assume that Emma is mistaken.
    - **Factive Verb Exception:** Verbs like "knows" and "learns" are factive. If Person A knows that Person B *knows/learns* X, then X must be true. However, if Person A knows that Person B *thinks* X, it does not mean X is true.

2.  **The Counterexample Test is Paramount:** Your core task is to rigorously ask: **"If the Premise is 100% true, is it logically necessary that the Hypothesis is also 100% true?"**
    - To decide **non-entailment**, you must find **just one plausible scenario** where the Premise is true but the Hypothesis is false. If such a scenario exists, the answer is non-entailment.
    - **Apply this to Beliefs:** For a premise about Person A's mental state regarding Person B's mental state, a key counterexample is that **Person A does not themselves believe the factual content of Person B's belief.** Person A might believe Person B is incorrect, lying, or deceived.

3.  **Avoid Over-Literalism and Use Common Sense (Retained & Refined):**
    - Do not require the Hypothesis to use the exact same words as the Premise. Focus on the core meaning and logical consequences. Synonyms and paraphrases (e.g., "man in robe" â†’ "a man", "dirt ground" â†’ "in the dirt outside") are acceptable and often indicate entailment.
    - **You MUST use common-sense world knowledge. Assume typical scenarios, not rare or far-fetched ones.** For example, "dirt ground" is typically outdoors, so inferring "outside" is valid. Do not invent technically possible but highly unusual counter-examples (e.g., an indoor dirt ground) to break a valid entailment.

**Process:**
- **Step 1: Restate.** Rephrase the Premise and Hypothesis in your own words to ensure deep understanding. Identify all mental states and their relationships.
- **Step 2: Apply the Counterexample Test.** Ask: "Can I imagine a realistic situation where the Premise is true but the Hypothesis is false?" Pay special attention to Guideline 1 regarding beliefs about beliefs.
- **Step 3: Judge.** If no plausible counterexample scenario exists, the answer is entailment. If a plausible counterexample exists, the answer is non-entailment.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example 1 (Non-Entailment: Belief about a Belief):**
Premise: Thomas assumes that Emma thinks that two butchers are walking through their shop.
Hypothesis: Thomas assumes that two butchers are walking through their shop.
Analysis: The premise is about Thomas's assumption of Emma's belief. The hypothesis is about Thomas's assumption of a fact in the world. A plausible counterexample exists: Thomas might know the shop is closed and the butchers are gone, but he assumes that Emma (who is not aware) still thinks they are there. Therefore, the premise can be true while the hypothesis is false. This is **non-entailment**.

**Example 2 (Entailment: Factive Verb):**
Premise: Sarah knows that David learned that the meeting is canceled.
Hypothesis: The meeting is canceled.
Analysis: "Learned" is a factive verb; if David learned X, then X is true. The premise states Sarah knows this factive relationship occurred. Therefore, the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. This is **entailment**.

**Example 3 (Entailment: Common Sense & Paraphrasing):**
Premise: David suspects that a man in a robe is making designs on dirt ground.
Hypothesis: David suspects that a man is making designs in the dirt outside.
Analysis: The core suspicion is identical. "Man in a robe" is a type of "man". "On dirt ground" commonsensically implies "in the dirt outside". There is no plausible scenario where the premise is true but the hypothesis is false. This is **entailment**.

**Now, analyze the following input:**

You are an expert in natural language inference (NLI). Your task is to determine if the Premise sentence logically entails the Hypothesis sentence.

**Definition:**
- **Entailment** means that if the Premise is true, then the Hypothesis must also be true. Your goal is to see if the truth of the Premise guarantees the truth of the Hypothesis.

**Crucial Guidelines for Analysis:**

1.  **Analyze Nested Mental States with Extreme Care:** Pay close attention to sentences about beliefs, assumptions, knowledge, suspicions, and other mental states (e.g., "X thinks that...", "Y suspects that...", "Z learned that...").
    - **Critical Distinction:** You must distinguish between **factive** and **non-factive** mental state verbs.
    - **Factive Verbs (Entailment):** Verbs like *knows, realizes, remembers, acknowledges* imply the speaker accepts the embedded fact as true. If the Premise uses a factive verb, the subject is committed to the truth of the content.
        - **Example:** "Anna knows that Bob remembers the party" entails "Anna knows the party happened."
    - **Non-Factive Verbs (No Entailment):** Verbs like *believes, assumes, suspects, thinks* do NOT imply the speaker accepts the embedded fact as true. When these describe a belief about another person's mental state, they merely report that belief without endorsement.
        - **Example:** "Chris believes that Dana suspects it will rain" does NOT entail "Chris believes it will rain." Chris could be accurately reporting Dana's suspicion while personally doubting it.
    - **Key Test:** Ask: "Does the premise state that the subject is personally committed to the truth (factive), or merely describing someone else's belief (non-factive)?"

2.  **Avoid Over-Literalism and Use Common Sense:**
    - Do not require the Hypothesis to use the exact same words as the Premise. Focus on the core meaning and logical consequences. Synonyms and paraphrases (e.g., "man in robe" â†’ "a man", "dirt ground" â†’ "in the dirt outside") are acceptable and often indicate entailment.

Do not invent technically possible but highly unusual counter-examples (e.g., an indoor dirt ground) to break the entailment.

3.  **Process:**
    - **Step 1:** Identify all mental state verbs. Classify them as factive (entails content) or non-factive (does not entail content).
    - **Step 2:** Restate the Premise and Hypothesis in your own words to ensure understanding.
    - **Step 3:** Apply the guidelines above. Ask: **"If the Premise is unquestionably true, is there any plausible scenario where the Hypothesis could be false?"**
        - **For nested non-factive beliefs (e.g., 'A believes that B assumes X'), the plausible scenario is: "A is correctly reporting B's assumption but does not personally believe X themselves."**
    - **If no such plausible scenario exists, the answer is entailment. If a plausible scenario is possible, the answer is non-entailment.**

**Examples of Correct Reasoning (Learn from these):**

**Example 1 (Non-Factive - NO Entailment):**
Premise: David believes that Evelyn assumes that a woman sits on a rug.
Hypothesis: David believes that a woman sits on a rug.
Analysis: The verb "believes" is non-factive. David is only describing Evelyn's assumption. It is plausible David does not share this belief. The premise does NOT guarantee the hypothesis.
<answer>non-entailment</answer>

**Example 2 (Factive - Entailment):**
Premise: David knows that Evelyn remembers that a woman sits on a rug.
Hypothesis: David knows that a woman sits on a rug.
Analysis: The verbs "knows" and "remembers" are factive. David is committed to the truth of the embedded fact. The premise guarantees the hypothesis.
<answer>entailment</answer>

**Example 3 (Common Sense & Paraphrasing - Entailment):**
Premise: David suspects that a man in a robe is making designs on dirt ground.
Hypothesis: David suspects that a man is making designs in the dirt outside.
Analysis: Not a nested belief. The core suspicion is identical. Paraphrasing ("man in a robe"â†’"man", "dirt ground"â†’"in the dirt outside") is valid based on common sense. No plausible counter-scenario.

**Definition:**
- **Entailment** means that if the Premise is true, then the Hypothesis must also be true. Your goal is to see if the truth of the Premise guarantees the truth of the Hypothesis.

**Crucial Guidelines for Analysis:**
1.  **Analyze Beliefs and Knowledge Carefully:** Pay close attention to sentences about beliefs, thoughts, knowledge, suspicions, and other mental states (e.g., "X thinks that...", "Y suspects that...", "Z learned that...").
    - **Mental State Strength Rule:** The strength of mental state verbs is critical for determining entailment.
        - **Strong Endorsement:** If the first person's verb indicates certainty or factivity (e.g., *knows, learns, realizes, is aware, remembers*) or strong belief (e.g., *believes, thinks*), then they typically endorse the content of nested beliefs. Example: "Bob knows that Alice knows P" entails "Bob knows P."
        - **Weak or No Endorsement:** If the first person's verb indicates uncertainty or weak attribution (e.g., *suspects, assumes, guesses, wonders if*), they often do NOT endorse the content of nested beliefs. Example: "Bob suspects that Alice assumes P" does NOT entail "Bob suspects P." Bob may suspect that Alice is mistaken.

2.  **Avoid Over-Literalism and Use Common Sense:**
    - Do not require the Hypothesis to use the exact same words as the Premise. Focus on the core meaning and logical consequences. Synonyms and paraphrases (e.g., "man in robe" â†’ "a man", "dirt ground" â†’ "in the dirt outside") are acceptable and often indicate entailment.

3.  **Process:**
    - **Step 1:** Restate the Premise and Hypothesis in your own words to ensure understanding.
    - **Step 2:** Identify all mental state verbs (e.g., knows, believes, suspects, assumes). Determine who holds the belief and what the content of the belief is.
    - **Step 3:** Apply the Mental State Strength Rule. For nested beliefs, ask: "Does the first person's mental state verb strongly imply they accept the nested content as true, or could they merely be reporting a belief they think might be wrong?"
    - **Step 4:** Apply common sense and paraphrasing rules. Ask: "If the Premise is unquestionably true, is there any **plausible** scenario where the Hypothesis could be false? **Specifically, for weak verbs like 'suspects' or 'assumes', could the person be attributing a belief they themselves doubt?**"
    - **Final Decision:** If no plausible scenario exists, the answer is entailment. If a plausible scenario is possible, the answer is non-entailment.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example 1 (Strong Verb - Entailment):**
Premise: Michael knows that Charles learned that eight tourists are present.
Hypothesis: Michael knows that eight tourists are present.
Analysis: The verb "knows" is factive and indicates strong endorsement. If Michael knows that Charles learned a fact, then Michael knows that fact himself. Entailment.

**Example 2 (Common Sense - Entailment):**
Premise: David suspects that a man in a robe is making designs on dirt ground.
Hypothesis: David suspects that a man is making designs in the dirt outside.
Analysis: The core suspicion is identical. "Man in a robe" is a type of "man". "On dirt ground" common-sense implies "in the dirt outside". Paraphrasing is valid. No plausible counter-scenario. Entailment.

**Example 3 (Weak Verbs - Non-Entailment):**
Premise: Robert suspects that Amelia assumes that a young man waits on a bench.
Hypothesis: Robert suspects that a young man waits on a bench.
Analysis: The premise uses weak verbs ("suspects", "assumes"). Robert suspects that Amelia holds a belief, but this does not mean he endorses that belief. A plausible scenario exists: Robert might suspect that Amelia is making an incorrect assumption. Therefore, the premise does not guarantee the hypothesis. Non-entailment.

**Definition:**
- **Entailment** means that if the Premise is true, then the Hypothesis must also be true. Your goal is to see if the truth of the Premise guarantees the truth of the Hypothesis.

**Crucial Guidelines for Analysis:**
1.  **Analyze Mental States with Precision:** Pay extremely close attention to sentences about beliefs, thoughts, assumptions, knowledge, suspicions, understandings, and other mental states (e.g., "X assumes that...", "Y thinks that...", "Z knows that...", "A understands that...").
    - **Critical Distinction:** A belief *about another person's belief* is NOT automatically a belief *about the world*. The premise may describe what one person assumes about another's thoughts without committing to the truth of those thoughts.
        - **Example:** "Thomas assumes that Emma thinks it is raining" **does not entail** "Thomas assumes it is raining." Thomas could assume that Emma is mistaken.
    - **Factive Verb Exception:** Verbs like **"knows," "learns," "understands," "realizes," "is aware," "recognizes,"** and **"remembers"** (in its factive sense) are **factive**. They presuppose the truth of their complement clause.
        - **If Person A's mental state is about Person B's factive mental state,** then the truth of the embedded fact is guaranteed within the context of Person A's belief.
            - **Example:** "Sarah knows that David **learned** that the meeting is canceled" **entails** "The meeting is canceled."
        - **Crucially, if Person A has a mental state about Person B *having* a factive mental state, then Person A is committed to the truth of the fact.**
            - **Example:** "David suspects that Abigail **understands** that X" **entails** "David suspects that X." David cannot suspect that Abigail *correctly understands* a falsehood; he can only suspect she *incorrectly believes* a falsehood. The verb "understands" forces the truth of X within the context of David's suspicion.

2.  **The Counterexample Test is Paramount:** Your core task is to rigorously ask: **"If the Premise is 100% true, is it logically necessary that the Hypothesis is also 100% true?"**
    - To decide **non-entailment**, you must find **just one plausible scenario** where the Premise is true but the Hypothesis is false. If such a scenario exists, the answer is non-entailment.
    - **Apply this to Beliefs:** For a premise about Person A's mental state regarding Person B's mental state, a key counterexample is that **Person A does not themselves believe the factual content of Person B's belief.** However, this counterexample is **IMPLAUSIBLE** if Person B's mental state is described with a **factive verb** (see Guideline 1).

3.  **Avoid Over-Literalism and Use Common Sense (Retained & Refined):**
    - Do not require the Hypothesis to use the exact same words as the Premise. Focus on the core meaning and logical consequences. Synonyms and paraphrases (e.g., "man in robe" â†’ "a man", "dirt ground" â†’ "in the dirt outside") are acceptable and often indicate entailment.

**Process:**
- **Step 1: Restate and Identify Verbs.** Rephrase the Premise and Hypothesis in your own words to ensure deep understanding. **Identify all verbs describing mental states (e.g., thinks, knows, understands, assumes). For each, determine if it is FACTIVE (presupposes truth) or NON-FACTIVE (does not presuppose truth).** This is the most critical step.
- **Step 2: Apply the Counterexample Test.** Ask: "Can I imagine a realistic situation where the Premise is true but the Hypothesis is false?" **When the premise involves a factive verb, remember that the truth of the embedded clause is non-negotiable for the premise to be true.**
- **Step 3: Judge.** If no plausible counterexample scenario exists, the answer is entailment. If a plausible counterexample exists, the answer is non-entailment.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example 1 (Non-Entailment: Non-Factive Verb):**
Premise: Thomas assumes that Emma thinks that two butchers are walking through their shop.
Hypothesis: Thomas assumes that two butchers are walking through their shop.
Analysis: The verb "thinks" is non-factive. A plausible counterexample exists: Thomas might know the shop is closed but assume that Emma (who is not aware) still thinks they are there. Therefore, the premise can be true while the hypothesis is false. This is **non-entailment**.

**Example 2 (Entailment: Simple Factive Verb):**
Premise: Sarah knows that David learned that the meeting is canceled.
Hypothesis: The meeting is canceled.
Analysis: "Learned" is a factive verb; if David learned X, then X is true. The premise states Sarah knows this factive relationship occurred. Therefore, the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. This is **entailment**.

**Example 3 (Entailment: Factive Verb in a Belief about a Belief - CRITICAL EXAMPLE):**
Premise: David suspects that Abigail **understands** that a man takes a drink in the doorway of a home.
Hypothesis: David suspects that a man takes a drink in the doorway of a home.
Analysis: The key is the verb "**understands**," which is factive. If Abigail *understands* that X, then X is true. The premise states that David suspects this factive relationship is occurring. Therefore, for David's suspicion about Abigail's understanding to be plausible, David must himself suspect that X is a true fact. There is no plausible counterexample. This is **entailment**.

**Example 4 (Non-Entailment: Contrast with Example 3):**
Premise: David suspects that Abigail **thinks** that a man takes a drink in the doorway of a home.
Hypothesis: David suspects that a man takes a drink in the doorway of a home.
Analysis: The verb "**thinks**" is non-factive. A plausible counterexample exists: David might know the man is not drinking but suspect that Abigail incorrectly *thinks* he is. Therefore, the premise can be true while the hypothesis is false. This is **non-entailment**.

**Example 5 (Entailment: Common Sense & Paraphrasing):**
Premise: David suspects that a man in a robe is making designs on dirt ground.
Hypothesis: David suspects that a man is making designs in the dirt outside.
Analysis: The core suspicion is identical. "Man in a robe" is a type of "man". "On dirt ground" commonsensically implies "in the dirt outside". There is no plausible scenario where the premise is true but the hypothesis is false. This is **entailment**.

**Definition:**
- **Entailment** means that if the Premise is true, then the Hypothesis must also be true. Your goal is to see if the truth of the Premise guarantees the truth of the Hypothesis.

**Crucial Guidelines for Analysis:**
1.  **Analyze Mental States Precisely:** Pay close attention to sentences about beliefs, thoughts, knowledge, suspicions, and other mental states (e.g., "X thinks that...", "Y suspects that...", "Z understands that...").
    - **Verb Classification:** Categorize mental state verbs into three types:
        - **Factive Verbs:** *knows, learns, realizes, is aware, remembers, understands, acknowledges, recognizes, sees.* These imply their content is true.
        - **Belief Verbs:** *believes, thinks, assumes, presumes, expects.* The subject holds this belief, but it may not be certain.
        - **Reporting/Weak Verbs:** *suspects, guesses, assumes* **when used to report another's belief.** The subject describes someone else's mental state without endorsing it.
    - **Nested Belief Rule:** For "X [verb1] that Y [verb2] that P":
        - If `verb1` is a **Reporting verb**, X does not necessarily endorse P. (Example: "X suspects that Y assumes P" â†’ NON-entailment for "X suspects P").
        - If `verb1` is a **Belief or Factive verb**, analyze `verb2`:
            - If `verb2` is **Factive**, then "Y [verb2] that P" entails P is true. Thus, if X believes this, X believes P. **ENTAILMENT.**
            - If `verb2` is a **Belief verb**, X may believe Y is mistaken. **NON-ENTAILMENT.**
            - If `verb2` is a **Reporting verb**, apply this rule recursively.

2.  **Avoid Over-Literalism and Use Common Sense:**
    - Do not require the Hypothesis to use the exact same words as the Premise. Focus on core meaning. Synonyms and paraphrases (e.g., "man in robe" â†’ "a man", "dirt ground" â†’ "outside") are acceptable.
    - **You MUST use common-sense world knowledge. Assume typical scenarios, not rare or far-fetched ones.** For example, "dirt ground" is typically outdoors.
    - **Plausibility Test:** When judging if the Hypothesis could be false, the scenario must be linguistically natural and contextually reasonable. Do not invent scenarios that violate word meanings (e.g., assuming someone "understands" a falsehood) or are highly contrived.

3.  **Process:**
    - **Step 1:** Restate the Premise and Hypothesis in your own words.
    - **Step 2:** Identify all mental state verbs. Classify each as Factive, Belief, or Reporting. Determine the belief holders and content.
    - **Step 3:** Apply the Nested Belief Rule above. For nested structures, ask: "Does the first person's verb imply they accept the nested content as true, or are they merely reporting a belief they might doubt?"
    - **Step 4:** Apply common sense and paraphrasing rules. Ask: "If the Premise is true, is there any **plausible** scenario where the Hypothesis could be false? **Specifically, for weak reporting verbs, could the person be attributing a belief they themselves doubt? For belief/factive verbs, is the nested content factive?**"
    - **Final Decision:** If no plausible scenario exists, the answer is entailment. If a plausible scenario is possible, the answer is non-entailment.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example 1 (Strong Verb - Entailment):**
Premise: Michael knows that Charles learned that eight tourists are present.
Hypothesis: Michael knows that eight tourists are present.
Analysis: "Knows" is factive. If Michael knows Charles learned P, then Michael knows P. Entailment.

**Example 2 (Common Sense - Entailment):**
Premise: David suspects that a man in a robe is making designs on dirt ground.
Hypothesis: David suspects that a man is making designs in the dirt outside.
Analysis: Core suspicion is identical. Paraphrasing is valid. No plausible counter-scenario. Entailment.

**Example 3 (Reporting Verbs - Non-Entailment):**
Premise: Robert suspects that Amelia assumes that a young man waits on a bench.
Hypothesis: Robert suspects that a young man waits on a bench.
Analysis: "Suspects" is a reporting verb. Robert suspects Amelia holds a belief, but he may not endorse it. Plausible he thinks she is wrong. Non-entailment.

**Example 4 (Belief Verb + Factive Verb - Entailment):**
Premise: Joseph assumes that Amelia understands that three military officials are battling a fire.
Hypothesis: Joseph assumes that three military officials are battling a fire.
Analysis: "Assumes" is a belief verb (Joseph holds this belief). "Understands" is factive. If Joseph assumes Amelia understands P, he assumes P is true (as it is implausible to assume someone understands a falsehood). Entailment.

**Definition:**
- **Entailment** means that if the Premise is true, then the Hypothesis must also be true. Your goal is to see if the truth of the Premise guarantees the truth of the Hypothesis.

**Crucial Guidelines for Analysis:**

1.  **Analyze Nested Mental States with a Hierarchical Approach:** Pay extreme attention to sentences about beliefs, assumptions, knowledge, suspicions, and other mental states (e.g., "X thinks that...", "Y suspects that...", "Z learned that...").
    - **Step 1:** Identify and classify all mental state verbs as **factive** or **non-factive**.
        - **Factive Verbs (Entail Truth):** *knows, learns, realizes, remembers, acknowledges, is aware that*. These imply the speaker accepts the embedded fact as true.
        - **Non-Factive Verbs (No Truth Entailment):** *believes, assumes, suspects, thinks, feels*. These report a belief without endorsing its truth.
    - **Step 2: Apply the Hierarchy Rule for Nested Beliefs:**
        - **If the outermost verb is non-factive (e.g., believes, suspects):**
            - **AND** it embeds a **non-factive** verb (e.g., "A believes that B assumes X"): Then the subject (A) is merely describing B's mental state. There is **NO** entailment to A's belief in X.
            - **BUT** if it embeds a **factive** verb (e.g., "A believes that B knows X"): Then the subject (A) is describing a state of *knowledge*. To believe someone *knows* a fact is to believe that fact is true. There **IS** entailment to A's belief in X.
        - **If the outermost verb is factive (e.g., knows, realizes):** Then the subject is committed to the truth of the entire embedded clause. Analyze the hypothesis based on this commitment.

2.  **Avoid Over-Literalism and Use Common Sense:**
    - Do not require the Hypothesis to use the exact same words as the Premise. Focus on the core meaning and logical consequences. Synonyms and paraphrases (e.g., "man in robe" â†’ "a man", "dirt ground" â†’ "in the dirt outside") are acceptable and often indicate entailment.
    - **You MUST use common-sense world knowledge. Assume typical scenarios, not rare or far-fetched ones.** For example, "dirt ground" is typically outdoors, so inferring "outside" is valid. Do not invent technically possible but highly unusual counter-examples (e.g., an indoor dirt ground) to break the entailment.

3.  **Process:**
    - **Step 1:** Identify all mental state verbs. Classify them and apply the Hierarchy Rule (Guideline 1, Step 2).
    - **Step 2:** Restate the Premise and Hypothesis in your own words to ensure understanding.
    - **Step 3:** Apply the guidelines above. Ask the critical question: **"If the Premise is unquestionably true, is there any plausible and semantically coherent scenario where the Hypothesis could be false?"**
        - **Semantic Coherence is Key:** The scenario must not violate the standard meaning of words. For example, a scenario where a person believes someone "learned" a fact but doesn't believe the fact themselves is semantically incoherent (as "learns" implies truth) and is therefore **not plausible**.
    - **If no such plausible and coherent scenario exists, the answer is entailment. If one is possible, the answer is non-entailment.**

**Examples of Correct Reasoning (Learn from these):**

**Example 1 (Non-Factive embedding Non-Factive - NO Entailment):**
Premise: David believes that Evelyn assumes that a woman sits on a rug.
Hypothesis: David believes that a woman sits on a rug.
Analysis: Outer verb "believes" (non-factive) embeds "assumes" (non-factive). David is only describing Evelyn's assumption. It is plausible David does not share this belief.
<answer>non-entailment</answer>

**Example 2 (Factive embedding Factive - Entailment):**
Premise: David knows that Evelyn remembers that a woman sits on a rug.
Hypothesis: David knows that a woman sits on a rug.
Analysis: Outer verb "knows" (factive) commits David to the truth of the embedded clause, which itself contains a factive verb ("remembers") that entails the event happened.
<answer>entailment</answer>

**Example 3 (Non-Factive embedding Factive - Entailment):**
Premise: Chris believes that Dana knows it will rain.
Hypothesis: Chris believes it will rain.
Analysis: Outer verb "believes" (non-factive) embeds "knows" (factive). To believe that someone *knows* a fact is to believe that fact is true. There is no semantically coherent scenario where Chris believes Dana knows it will rain but Chris himself does not believe it will rain.
<answer>entailment</answer>

**Example 4 (Common Sense & Paraphrasing - Entailment):**
Premise: David suspects that a man in a robe is making designs on dirt ground.
Hypothesis: David suspects that a man is making designs in the dirt outside.
Analysis: Not a nested belief. The core suspicion is identical. Paraphrasing is valid based on common sense. No plausible counter-scenario.
<answer>entailment</answer>

**Example of Incorrect Reasoning to Avoid:**
Premise: Abigail believes that John learns that two people kiss.
Hypothesis: Abigail believes that two people kiss.
*Incorrect Analysis:* "Believes" is non-factive, so Abigail might not believe the content. -> NON-ENTAILMENT.
*Correct Analysis (Per Hierarchy Rule):* "Believes" (non-factive) embeds "learns" (factive). Believing someone *learned* something entails believing that thing is true. -> ENTAILMENT.

**Now, analyze the following input:**

You are an expert in natural language inference (NLI). Your task is to determine if the Premise sentence logically entails the Hypothesis sentence.

**Definition:**
- **Entailment** means that if the Premise is true, then the Hypothesis must also be true. Your goal is to see if the truth of the Premise guarantees the truth of the Hypothesis.

**Crucial Guidelines for Analysis:**
1.  **Analyze Mental States Precisely:** Pay close attention to sentences about beliefs, thoughts, knowledge, suspicions, and other mental states (e.g., "X thinks that...", "Y suspects that...", "Z understands that...").
    - **Verb Classification:** Categorize mental state verbs into three types:
        - **Factive Verbs:** *knows, learns, realizes, is aware, remembers, understands, acknowledges, recognizes, sees.* These imply their content is true.
        - **Belief Verbs:** *believes, thinks, assumes, presumes, expects.* The subject holds this belief, but it may not be certain.
        - **Reporting/Neutral Verbs:** *suspects, guesses, speculates, wonders if.* The subject describes a mental state without full endorsement. **However, the degree of endorsement depends critically on the verb that follows.**
    - **Nested Belief Rule:** For "X [verb1] that Y [verb2] that P":
        - If `verb1` is a **Reporting verb**, analyze `verb2`:
            - If `verb2` is **Factive**, then reporting that Y knows P creates a strong pragmatic implication that X finds P credible. **ENTAILMENT for "X [verb1] that P".**
            - If `verb2` is a **Belief verb**, X may believe Y is mistaken. **NON-ENTAILMENT.**
            - If `verb2` is a **Reporting verb**, apply this rule recursively.
        - If `verb1` is a **Belief or Factive verb**, analyze `verb2`:
            - If `verb2` is **Factive**, then "Y [verb2] that P" entails P is true. Thus, if X believes this, X believes P. **ENTAILMENT.**
            - If `verb2` is a **Belief verb**, X may believe Y is mistaken. **NON-ENTAILMENT.**
            - If `verb2` is a **Reporting verb**, apply this rule recursively.

2.  **Avoid Over-Literalism and Use Common Sense:**
    - Do not require the Hypothesis to use the exact same words as the Premise. Focus on core meaning. Synonyms and paraphrases (e.g., "man in robe" â†’ "a man", "dirt ground" â†’ "outside") are acceptable.
    - **You MUST use common-sense world knowledge. Assume typical scenarios, not rare or far-fetched ones.** For example, "dirt ground" is typically outdoors.
    - **Plausibility Test:** When judging if the Hypothesis could be false, the scenario must be linguistically natural and contextually reasonable. Do not invent scenarios that:
        - Violate word meanings (e.g., assuming someone "knows" a falsehood)
        - Are highly contrived or violate standard pragmatic use (e.g., reporting that someone "knows P" while believing P is false)

3.  **Process:**
    - **Step 1:** Restate the Premise and Hypothesis in your own words.
    - **Step 2:** Identify all mental state verbs. Classify each as Factive, Belief, or Reporting. Determine the belief holders and content.
    - **Step 3:** Apply the Nested Belief Rule above. For nested structures, ask: "Does the combination of verbs create a strong pragmatic implication about the truth of the embedded content?"
    - **Step 4:** Apply common sense and paraphrasing rules. Ask: "If the Premise is true, is there any **plausible** scenario where the Hypothesis could be false? **Specifically, consider whether the mental state verbs allow for doubt of the embedded content.**"
    - **Final Decision:** If no plausible scenario exists, the answer is entailment. If a plausible scenario is possible, the answer is non-entailment.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example 1 (Strong Verb - Entailment):**
Premise: Michael knows that Charles learned that eight tourists are present.
Hypothesis: Michael knows that eight tourists are present.
Analysis: "Knows" is factive. If Michael knows Charles learned P, then Michael knows P. Entailment.

**Example 2 (Common Sense - Entailment):**
Premise: David suspects that a man in a robe is making designs on dirt ground.
Hypothesis: David suspects that a man is making designs in the dirt outside.
Analysis: Core suspicion is identical. Paraphrasing is valid. No plausible counter-scenario. Entailment.

**Example 3 (Reporting + Belief Verbs - Non-Entailment):**
Premise: Robert suspects that Amelia assumes that a young man waits on a bench.
Hypothesis: Robert suspects that a young man waits on a bench.
Analysis: "Suspects" is a reporting verb. "Assumes" is a belief verb. Robert suspects Amelia holds a belief, but he may not endorse it. Plausible he thinks she is wrong. Non-entailment.

**Example 4 (Reporting + Factive Verbs - Entailment):**
Premise: Richard suspects that Amelia knows that the wind propels a sailing ship.
Hypothesis: Richard suspects that the wind propels a sailing ship.
Analysis: "Suspects" is reporting verb. "Knows" is factive. Reporting that someone knows P pragmatically implies the speaker finds P credible. It is implausible that Richard suspects Amelia knows a falsehood. Entailment.

**Example 5 (Belief Verb + Factive Verb - Entailment):**
Premise: Joseph assumes that Amelia understands that three military officials are battling a fire.
Hypothesis: Joseph assumes that three military officials are battling a fire.
Analysis: "Assumes" is a belief verb. "Understands" is factive. If Joseph assumes Amelia understands P, he assumes P is true (as it is implausible to assume someone understands a falsehood). Entailment.

**Now, analyze the following input:**

Question:
Premise: {premise}

You are an expert in natural language inference (NLI). Your task is to determine if the Premise sentence logically entails the Hypothesis sentence.

**Definition:**
- **Entailment** means that if the Premise is true, then the Hypothesis must also be true. Your goal is to see if the truth of the Premise guarantees the truth of the Hypothesis.

**Crucial Guidelines for Analysis:**
1.  **Analyze Mental States with Precision:** Pay extremely close attention to sentences about beliefs, thoughts, assumptions, knowledge, suspicions, understandings, and other mental states (e.g., "X assumes that...", "Y thinks that...", "Z knows that...", "A understands that...").
    - **Critical Distinction:** A belief *about another person's belief* is NOT automatically a belief *about the world*. The premise may describe what one person assumes about another's thoughts without committing to the truth of those thoughts.
        - **Example:** "Thomas assumes that Emma thinks it is raining" **does not entail** "Thomas assumes it is raining." Thomas could assume that Emma is mistaken.
    - **Factive Verb Exception:** Verbs like **"knows," "learns," "understands," "realizes," "is aware," "recognizes,"** and **"remembers"** (in its factive sense) are **factive**. They presuppose the truth of their complement clause.
        - **If Person A's mental state is about Person B's factive mental state,** then the truth of the embedded fact is guaranteed within the context of Person A's belief.
            - **Example:** "Sarah knows that David **learned** that the meeting is canceled" **entails** "The meeting is canceled."
        - **Crucially, if Person A has a mental state about Person B *having* a factive mental state, then Person A is committed to the truth of the fact.**
            - **Example:** "David suspects that Abigail **understands** that X" **entails** "David suspects that X." David cannot suspect that Abigail *correctly understands* a falsehood; he can only suspect she *incorrectly believes* a falsehood. The verb "understands" forces the truth of X within the context of David's suspicion.

2.  **Scope and Truth are Separate:** The truth of a premise about a mental state (e.g., "A assumes that B knows X") is **only** a statement about Person A's mind. It is **NOT** a statement about the actual truth of the embedded clauses.
    - **Critical Rule:** The premise "A assumes that B knows X" is **100% true** if A truly holds that assumption, **even if B does not actually know X and X is false.** The premise's truth is about A's mental act of assuming, not about the correctness of the assumption.
    - **Therefore, for entailment to hold from a premise like "A assumes P" to a hypothesis "P", the hypothesis must follow from the *act of assuming* itself, not from the *likely correctness* of the assumption.** An assumption about a fact does not make that fact true.

3.  **The Counterexample Test is Paramount:** Your core task is to rigorously ask: **"If the Premise is 100% true, is it logically necessary that the Hypothesis is also 100% true?"**
    - To decide **non-entailment**, you must find **any logically possible scenario**, however unlikely, where the Premise is true but the Hypothesis is false. If such a scenario exists, the answer is non-entailment.
    - **Apply this to Beliefs:** For a premise about Person A's mental state regarding Person B's mental state, a key counterexample is that **Person A does not themselves believe the factual content of Person B's belief.** However, this counterexample is **IMPLAUSIBLE** if Person B's mental state is described with a **factive verb** (see Guideline 1). **Do not confuse the *truth of a belief* with the *correctness of a belief*.** A person can hold a false belief, and the statement that they hold that belief can be true.

4.  **Avoid Over-Literalism and Use Common Sense (Retained & Refined):**
    - Do not require the Hypothesis to use the exact same words as the Premise. Focus on the core meaning and logical consequences. Synonyms and paraphrases (e.g., "man in robe" â†’ "a man", "dirt ground" â†’ "in the dirt outside") are acceptable and often indicate entailment.
    - **You MUST use common-sense world knowledge. Assume typical scenarios, not rare or far-fetched ones.** For example, "dirt ground" is typically outdoors, so inferring "outside" is valid. Do not invent technically possible but highly unusual counter-examples (e.g., an indoor dirt ground) to break a valid entailment.

**Process:**
- **Step 1: Restate and Identify Verbs.** Rephrase the Premise and Hypothesis in your own words to ensure deep understanding. **Identify all verbs describing mental states (e.g., thinks, knows, understands, assumes). For each, determine if it is FACTIVE (presupposes truth) or NON-FACTIVE (does not presuppose truth).** This is the most critical step.
- **Step 2: Apply the Counterexample Test.** Ask: "Can I imagine *any logically possible* situation where the Premise is true but the Hypothesis is false?" **Remember Guideline 2: The truth of the premise is only about the outermost mental state, not the correctness of the embedded content.**
- **Step 3: Judge.** If no logically possible counterexample scenario exists, the answer is entailment. If a logically possible counterexample exists, the answer is non-entailment.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example 1 (Non-Entailment: Non-Factive Verb):**
Premise: Thomas assumes that Emma thinks that two butchers are walking through their shop.
Hypothesis: Thomas assumes that two butchers are walking through their shop.
Analysis: The verb "thinks" is non-factive. A counterexample exists: Thomas might know the shop is closed but assume that Emma (who is not aware) still thinks they are there. Therefore, the premise can be true while the hypothesis is false. This is **non-entailment**.

**Example 2 (Entailment: Simple Factive Verb):**
Premise: Sarah knows that David learned that the meeting is canceled.
Hypothesis: The meeting is canceled.
Analysis: "Learned" is a factive verb; if David learned X, then X is true. The premise states Sarah knows this factive relationship occurred. Therefore, the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. This is **entailment**.

**Example 3 (Entailment: Factive Verb in a Belief about a Belief):**
Premise: David suspects that Abigail **understands** that a man takes a drink in the doorway of a home.
Hypothesis: David suspects that a man takes a drink in the doorway of a home.
Analysis: The key is the verb "**understands**," which is factive. The premise states that David suspects this factive relationship is occurring. Therefore, for David's suspicion about Abigail's understanding to be plausible, David must himself suspect that X is a true fact. There is no plausible counterexample. This is **entailment**.

**Example 4 (Non-Entailment: Contrast with Example 3):**
Premise: David suspects that Abigail **thinks** that a man takes a drink in the doorway of a home.
Hypothesis: David suspects that a man takes a drink in the doorway of a home.
Analysis: The verb "**thinks**" is non-factive. A counterexample exists: David might know the man is not drinking but suspect that Abigail incorrectly *thinks* he is. Therefore, the premise can be true while the hypothesis is false. This is **non-entailment**.

**Example 5 (Entailment: Common Sense & Paraphrasing):**
Premise: David suspects that a man in a robe is making designs on dirt ground.
Hypothesis: David suspects that a man is making designs in the dirt outside.
Analysis: The core suspicion is identical. "Man in a robe" is a type of "man". "On dirt ground" commonsensically implies "in the dirt outside". There is no plausible scenario where the premise is true but the hypothesis is false. This is **entailment**.

**Example 6 (Non-Entailment: Assumption about a Factive State - CRITICAL):**
Premise: William assumes that Isabella **understands** that a newspaper delivery man smiles.
Hypothesis: Isabella **understands** that a newspaper delivery man smiles.
Analysis:
-   **Step 1:** The premise states that William *assumes* (non-factive) that Isabella *understands* (factive) X.
-   **Step 2: Counterexample Test:** Is it logically necessary that if William assumes Isabella understands X, then Isabella *actually does* understand X? **No.** A clear counterexample exists: William could be mistaken. Isabella might have no opinion, or she might believe the man is frowning. William's assumption is about her state of mind, but it is just an assumption. It can be incorrect. Therefore, the premise can be true (William truly holds this assumption) while the hypothesis is false (Isabella does not actually understand X).
-   **Step 3:** This is **non-entailment**. The factivity of "understands" guarantees that *if* Isabella understands X, then X is true. However, it does **not** guarantee that Isabella *actually* understands X just because someone *assumes* she does.

**Now, analyze the following input:**

Question:
Premise: {premise}
Hypothesis: {hypothesis}
Options:
entailment
non-entailment

Your analysis:
e causal link from the original action.
6.  **Perform the Counterfactual Test:** Rigorously assess whether the outcome would have occurred in the same manner and timeframe without the agent's action. This test is definitive in simple cases but fails in overdetermination.
7.  **Apply the Pragmatic Difference-Making Principle:** In cases of simultaneous overdetermination (e.g., multiple sufficient causes all occurred), while each is *a* cause in a metaphysical sense, for the purpose of **attribution**, the cause is attributed to the **difference-making factor**. If the outcome would have occurred in the exact same way and at the same time without the agent's action, then that agent's action is **not** considered the cause in this context.
8.  **Avoid Common Pitfalls:**
    -   Do not exonerate an agent just because another agent was also culpable.
    -   Do not conflate being a necessary condition for the *scenario* with being a cause of the *outcome*.

**FRAMEWORK 2: INTENTIONALITY**

1.  **Identify the Outcome in Question:** Precisely define what the agent is alleged to have done intentionally.
2.  **Assess Triviality and Relevance:** Is the outcome a trivial, inevitable, or physically necessary side effect of the action (e.g., disturbing air molecules, creating sound waves)? If yes, and if it holds no moral or practical significance in the context, then it is **not intentional**. Proceed only if the outcome is non-trivial.
3.  **Establish the Agent's Mental State:**
    -   **Desire:** Did the agent want the outcome for its own sake (as an end)?
    -   **Belief:** Did the agent believe their action would bring about the outcome?
    -   **Certainty:** Was the outcome a certain or nearly certain result of the action?
    -   **Acceptance:** Did the agent proceed with the action despite knowing the outcome would occur?
4.  **Apply the Doctrine of Double Effect:** The Doctrine of Double Effect is a moral principle for assessing blame. For **attributing intentionality**, an effect is intentional **only if** the agent included it in their *plan of action* or sought it either as an **end** or as a **means** to their end. A side effect that is merely **foreseen and accepted**, but which is not a means or a goal, is **not intentional**.
5.  **Conclusion:** An action is intentional only if the agent acted with purpose to achieve it (as an end or a means). It is not intentional if it was merely a known but trivial or incidental side effect.

**FRAMEWORK 3: MORAL/LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY**

1.  **Establish Causation:** First, determine if the agent's action was **a** cause of the outcome using Framework 1.
2.  **Assess the Intervening Cause:** Was the actual direct cause (e.g., a drunk driver) a *foreseeable* consequence of the agent's action? A foreseeable intervening cause does *not* break responsibility.
3.  **Assess Fault & Culpability:** Even if the agent caused the outcome, are they to blame? Consider:
    -   **Knowledge:** Could the agent have reasonably foreseen the chain of events?
    -   **Intent:** Did the agent mean to cause harm?
    -   **Negligence:** Did the agent fail to exercise reasonable care?
    -   **Alternate Possibilities:** Could the agent have realistically chosen a different action? (Details about an immutable character trait suggest they could not, which mitigates blameworthiness *even if causation holds*).
4.  **Conclusion:** Distinguish between causing an outcome and being responsible for it. An agent can be a cause without being morally or legally responsible.

**EXAMPLES OF CORRECT REASONING:**

**Example 1: (Framework 1 - Conjunctive Causation)**
**Question:** Did the fertilization by Benni cause the plant to dry out?
**Facts:** Plants dried only where both A X200R (applied by Alex) and B Y33R (applied by Benni) were used. The combination was sufficient for the outcome.
**Analysis:** Benni's action was an indispensable part of the sufficient condition (the combination). Without it, the outcome would not have occurred.
**Conclusion:** Yes

**Example 2: (Framework 1 - Overdetermination & Difference-Making)**
**Question:** Did Drew ordering coffee on Tuesday cause the coffee shop to make a profit that day?
**Facts:** Drew, Kylie, and Oliver all ordered coffee. The shop profits if at least one person orders.
**Analysis:** This is simultaneous overdetermination. While Drew's order was sufficient, the profit would have occurred in the exact same manner and timeframe without him due to Kylie and Oliver's orders. Applying the Pragmatic Difference-Making Principle, Drew's action was not the difference-making cause.
**Conclusion:** No

**Example 3: (Framework 2 - Intentionality)**
**Question:** Did Benni cause the plant to dry out?
**Facts:** Benni knowingly used B Y33R against instructions to use only A X200R, aware that mixing chemicals could cause harm.
**Analysis:** The outcome (plant drying) is non-trivial. Benni did not desire harm but knowingly accepted the known risk as part of his plan to use the chemical. The harm was a foreseen and non-trivial consequence of his intended rule-breaking action.
**Conclusion:** Yes

**Example 4: (Framework 2 - Trivial Side Effect)**
**Question:** Did the sniper intentionally disturb some air molecules?
**Facts:** The sniper knew firing would disturb air molecules but was completely indifferent to this.
**Analysis:** Disturbing air molecules is a trivial, inevitable, and physically necessary side effect of firing a bullet. It holds no moral or practical significance. The outcome is trivial and was not part of the sniper's plan (his intention) as a means or an end.
**Conclusion:** No

Apply this rigorous, step-by-step reasoning to the following question. First, classify the question type. Then, reason step by step using the appropriate framework. Finally, state your final answer.

Answer questions about whether an agent acted *intentionally* to bring about a specific outcome. Rigorously follow these steps:

1.  **Identify the Action and Outcome:** State the agent's specific action and the specific outcome in question.
2.  **Extract the Causal Mechanism (For Context):** Briefly state the physical or system-level rule that links actions to the outcome. (e.g., "The outcome occurs if and only if [conditions]."). **Note:** This establishes factual causation but is not the sole basis for your final judgment on intentionality.
3.  **Determine the Agent's Mental State:** Infer the agent's primary goal, desire, or purpose based on the evidence provided. What were they trying to achieve?
4.  **Analyze Intentionality:** Judge the relationship between the agent's action and the outcome:
    - **Intended Outcome:** Was the outcome the agent's primary goal or a direct means to achieve that goal?
    - **Foreseen Side Effect:** Was the outcome a predictable consequence of the action, but not a goal or means to a goal? The agent may have been aware of it but indifferent or opposed.
    - **Unforeseen Side Effect:** Was the outcome unexpected and unforeseeable to the agent?
5.  **Apply the Intentionality Test:** The action is intentional **only if** the outcome was the agent's **primary goal** or a **necessary means** to achieve that goal. If the outcome was a **side effect** (foreseen or unforeseen), it was not intentional.
6.  **Output your final answer strictly within the tags: <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.**

**Key Principles to Uphold:**
- **Ignore Mere Causation:** An action can be causally necessary for an outcome without being intentional. Your task is to evaluate the agent's mind, not just the physical chain of events.
- **Consider All Evidence:** Use the agent's stated desires, knowledge, and the context to infer their primary goal.
- **Avoid Common Pitfalls:** Do not conflate causation with intention. Do not assume an outcome is intentional just because it was foreseen or occurred as a direct result of a voluntary action.

**Few-Shot Examples:**

**Example:**
Input: [Example 5 about Joe and the cup]
Reasoning:
1.  Action: Purchasing the Mega-Sized Smoothie. Outcome: Obtaining the commemorative cup.
2.  Mechanism: The cup is provided if and only if a Mega-Sized Smoothie is purchased.
3.  Mental State: Joe's primary goal was to get the largest smoothie. He explicitly stated he did not care about the cup.
4.  Analysis: The cup was a foreseen but unintended side effect of achieving his goal. It was not his goal nor a means to it.
5.  Intentionality Test: Outcome was a side effect, not intended.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example:**
Input: [Example 2 about Jake and his aunt]
Reasoning:
1.  Action: Pulling the trigger. Outcome: Aunt dies from a bullet to the heart.
2.  Mechanism: Death occurs if a bullet strikes the heart with sufficient force.
3.  Mental State: Jake's primary goal was to kill his aunt to inherit money.
4.  Analysis: The outcome (aunt's death) was his primary goal. The slip affected the method but not his intention.
5.  Intentionality Test: Outcome was the primary goal.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example:**
Input: [Example 3 about the hedgehog]
Reasoning:
1.  Action: Taking a pencil. Outcome: The polar bear finds no pencils.
2.  Mechanism: The box is empty if and only if all pencils are removed.
3.  Mental State: The hedgehog's goal was likely to acquire a pencil, as it had done previously. There is no evidence its goal was to cause a problem or deplete all pencils for the polar bear.
4.  Analysis: The polar bear's problem was an unforeseen side effect from the hedgehog's perspective, as it was absent when the rule was announced.
5.  Intentionality Test: Outcome was an unforeseen side effect, not intended.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these steps:

1.  **Determine the Question Type:**
    - If the question asks about **intentional causation** (e.g., uses words like "intentionally"), proceed to the **Intention Analysis** path (Step 2).
    - Otherwise, proceed to the **Causal Responsibility** path (Step 3).

2.  **Intention Analysis Path:**
    a.  **Identify the Outcome:** State the specific event the question asks about.
    b.  **Identify the Agent's Primary Goal:** Determine what the agent aimed to achieve with their action.
    c.  **Apply the Intention Test:** Answer "Yes" **only if** the outcome was the agent's direct goal or desired purpose for acting. If the outcome was a foreseen but undesired side effect or an unrelated consequence, answer "No".

3.  **Causal Responsibility Path:**
    a.  **Identify the Causal Mechanism:** Determine the precise physical rule that produces the outcome. State it clearly using logical connectives (e.g., "Outcome occurs if and only if [condition A] AND/OR [condition B] is true.").
    b.  **Identify the Outcome:** State the specific event that occurred.
    c.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test:** Ask: "If this specific agent had *not* performed their specific action at that time, would the outcome still have occurred according to the mechanism?"
        - If **no**, the action was a but-for cause. Proceed to the next step.
        - If **yes**, it was not. Answer "No".
    d.  **Apply the Normative Intervention Test:** Even if the action was a but-for cause, answer "No" if **all** of the following are true:
        - The agent was following valid instructions or rules.
        - The harmful outcome was directly caused by another agent's independent decision to violate those instructions or rules.
        - The outcome would have been prevented if all agents had followed the instructions.
    Otherwise, answer "Yes".

4.  **Output your final answer within <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.**

**Reasoning Strategies:**
- For a disjunctive mechanism (OR), if one condition is already true, an action enabling another condition is not a cause.
- For a conjunctive mechanism (AND), an action that provides a necessary condition is a cause.
- The counterfactual test is the definitive rule for physical causation, but the Normative Intervention Test overrules it for assigning responsibility.
- Always ignore the agent's character traits, apologies, or personal feelings. Focus on actions, goals, and instructions.

**Examples for Guidance:**
- *Example: Sniper and Air Molecules.* Question: "Did the sniper intentionally disturb some air molecules?" This is an **Intention Analysis**. The outcome is "disturb air molecules." The sniper's goal was to "kill the commander." The air disturbance was a side effect, not the goal. Therefore, the answer is <answer>No</answer>.
- *Example: Gardeners and Fertilizer.* Question: "Did the fertilization by Alex cause the plant to dry out?" This is **Causal Responsibility**. The mechanism is "plants dry IFF Chemical A AND Chemical B are applied." Alex's action (applying A) was a but-for cause. However, Alex followed instructions, and the outcome was directly caused by Benni's violation of those instructions. The Normative Intervention Test applies. Therefore, the answer is <answer>No</answer>.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these steps:

**Step 0: Classify the Question Type**
*   First, determine what is being asked:
    *   If the question contains words like "intentionally," "accidentally," "knowingly," or "on purpose," it is about **intentionality**. Proceed to **Path A**.
    *   If the question contains words like "responsible," "blame," "fault," or "negligent," it is about **blame/responsibility**. Proceed to **Path B**.
    *   Otherwise, the question is about **physical causation** (e.g., "cause," "prevent," "lead to"). Proceed to **Path C**.

**PATH C: FOR PHYSICAL CAUSATION QUESTIONS**

1.  **Define the Specific Outcome Token:** Precisely describe the outcome as the exact physical event that occurred at a specific time and place. Avoid general descriptions. (e.g., "The specific instance of the motion detector being triggered at 9:00:00 AM in the designated room on October 26th," not just "the detector went off").

2.  **Identify the Causal Mechanism:** Determine the most direct physical rule that produces the outcome. State it as a clear conditional rule (e.g., "The outcome occurs if and only if [precise physical condition] is met.").

3.  **Define the Agent's Specific Action Token:** Define the agent's action as a specific physical event: "[Agent]'s body performing [specific motion] at [time]." (e.g., "Billy's body moving into the room at 9:00:00 AM.").

4.  **Apply the Actual Cause Test:** For the action from step 3, ask: "Was this specific action a part of the set of actual, sufficient conditions that produced the specific outcome from step 1?"
    -   **Standard Counterfactual:** If the action had not occurred, would the specific outcome still have occurred identically? If **no**, it is a cause.
    -   **Overdetermination & Preemption:** If multiple sufficient causes existed (e.g., two people for a one-person detector), the action is **still a cause** if it was part of the actual set of conditions that occurred. Do not answer based solely on whether the outcome would have occurred *in some way* in the counterfactual world.

5.  **Uphold Key Invariants:** Base your reasoning solely on the physical causal chain. **You must ignore:**
    -   Permissions, policies, instructions, or social roles.
    -   The agent's knowledge, intentions, beliefs, or goals.
    -   Character traits, apologies, or negligence.
    -   Necessary preconditions; focus on necessity within the actual *sufficient* set.

6.  **Output your final answer within <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.**

**PATH A: FOR INTENTIONALITY QUESTIONS**
*   **Focus on Mental State:** Ignore the physical causal chain from Path C. Instead, determine the agent's goal (what they were trying to achieve) and their belief about how their action would achieve it.
*   **Apply the Intentionality Test:** Did the agent perform the action *in order to* bring about the outcome, believing their action would achieve it? If yes, answer **Yes**. If the outcome was a unforeseen accident or mistake (e.g., a slip), answer **No**.
*   **Output your final answer within <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.**

**PATH B: FOR BLAME/RESPONSIBILITY QUESTIONS**
*   **Focus on Duty and Foreseeability:** Ignore the physical causal chain from Path C. Instead, determine if the agent had a duty or obligation to act and whether a failure to act was a foreseeable cause of the outcome.
*   **Output your final answer within <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.**

**CRITICAL EXAMPLES FOR REFERENCE:**

**Example 4 (Intentionality):**
*   **Question:** "Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?"
*   **Correct Path:** Path A (Intentionality).
*   **Reasoning:** Jake's goal was to kill his aunt, but his hand slipped. The shot firing was not a controlled action aimed at achieving his goal; it was an accident. The outcome did not match his planned action.
*   **Correct Answer:** <answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 (Overdetermination):**
*   **Question:** "Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?"
*   **Correct Path:** Path C (Physical Causation).
*   **Reasoning:** The *specific outcome* is the detector going off at 9:00:00 AM. Billy's *specific action* was his body entering at that time. He was part of the actual set of sufficient conditions that triggered the detector. The counterfactual (if Billy hadn't entered, Suzy would have triggered it) describes a different sufficient set, but Billy was still a cause in the actual world.
*   **Correct Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these steps:

1.  **Determine the Question Type:**
    - If the question asks about **intentional causation** (e.g., uses words like "intentionally"), proceed to the **Intention Analysis** path (Step 2).
    - Otherwise, proceed to the **Causal Responsibility** path (Step 3).

2.  **Intention Analysis Path:**
    a.  **Identify the Outcome:** State the specific event the question asks about.
    b.  **Identify the Agent's Primary Goal:** Determine what the agent aimed to achieve with their action.
    c.  **Apply the Intention Test:** Answer "Yes" **only if** the outcome was the agent's direct goal or desired purpose for acting. If the outcome was a foreseen but undesired side effect or an unrelated consequence, answer "No".

3.  **Causal Responsibility Path:**
    a.  **Identify the Causal Mechanism:** Determine the precise physical rule that produces the outcome. State it clearly using logical connectives (e.g., "Outcome occurs if and only if [condition A] AND/OR [condition B] is true.").
    b.  **Identify the Outcome:** State the specific event that occurred.
    c.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test:** Ask: "If this specific agent had *not* performed their specific action (or *had* performed an omitted action), would the outcome still have occurred according to the mechanism?"
        - If **no**, the action/omission was a but-for cause. Proceed to the next step.
        - If **yes**, it was not. Answer "No".
    d.  **Apply the Normative Intervention Test (Strict):** Even if the action/omission was a but-for cause, answer "No" **only if all** of the following are strictly true:
        - The agent was performing a **normative, permitted action or inaction** under valid instructions or rules.
        - The harmful outcome was **directly and immediately caused by a separate, subsequent agent's independent decision to perform a non-normative, forbidden action** (a violation by commission, not mere omission).
        - The outcome would have been prevented **if that subsequent agent had followed the instructions instead of violating them**.
    Otherwise, answer "Yes".

4.  **Output your final answer within <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.**

**Reasoning Strategies:**
- For a disjunctive mechanism (OR), if one condition is already true, an action enabling another condition is not a cause.
- For a conjunctive mechanism (AND), an action that provides a necessary condition is a cause.
- The counterfactual test is the definitive rule for physical causation. The Normative Intervention Test is a narrow exception for specific chain-of-command scenarios involving a rule-breaking *action*.
- Always ignore the agent's character traits, apologies, or personal feelings. Focus on actions, goals, and instructions.
- **Special Case: Omissions:** An omission can be a but-for cause. The counterfactual for an omission is: "If the agent *had* performed the action, would the outcome have been avoided?"

**Examples for Guidance:**
- *Example: Sniper and Air Molecules.* Question: "Did the sniper intentionally disturb some air molecules?" This is an **Intention Analysis**. The outcome is "disturb air molecules." The sniper's goal was to "kill the commander." The air disturbance was a side effect, not the goal. Therefore, the answer is <answer>No</answer>.
- *Example: Gardeners and Fertilizer.* Question: "Did the fertilization by Alex cause the plant to dry out?" This is **Causal Responsibility**. The mechanism is "plants dry IFF Chemical A AND Chemical B are applied." Alex's action (applying A) was a but-for cause. However, Alex followed instructions, and the outcome was directly caused by Benni's violation (adding B). The Normative Intervention Test applies. Therefore, the answer is <answer>No</answer>.
- ***NEW Example: Factory Maintenance.*** Question: "Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?" This is **Causal Responsibility**. The mechanism is "Machine breaks IFF it is not oiled." The counterfactual test: If Kate *had* put oil in the machine, it would not have broken down. Therefore, her omission was a but-for cause. Now, check the Normative Intervention Test: Kate's inaction was permitted by the rules. However, the outcome was not *directly caused by a forbidden action*; it was caused by a state (lack of oil) resulting from Janet's omission. The NIT conditions are **not all met**. Therefore, the answer is <answer>Yes</answer>.

Answer questions about whether an agent acted *intentionally* to bring about a specific outcome. Rigorously follow these steps:

0.  **Classify the Question:** Determine if the query is primarily about **mental state/intentionality** (e.g., "did the agent intentionally...") or **causal attribution** (e.g., "did X happen because of Y?"). If it is a causal question, apply the Causal Attribution Framework (Steps C1-C4). If it is an intentionality question, proceed to the Intentionality Framework (Steps I1-I6).

**I. Intentionality Framework (For questions about mental state):**

1.  **Identify the Action and Outcome:** State the agent's specific action (or deliberate omission) and the specific outcome in question.
2.  **Extract the Causal Mechanism (For Context):** Briefly state the physical or system-level rule that links actions to the outcome. (e.g., "The outcome occurs if and only if [conditions]."). **Note:** This establishes factual causation but is not the sole basis for your final judgment on intentionality.
3.  **Determine the Agent's Mental State:** Infer the agent's primary goal, desire, or purpose. Crucially, also determine what other outcomes the agent **knew would certainly occur** as a direct result of their action, and what their attitude was towards those outcomes (e.g., desired, accepted, indifferent, or opposed).
4.  **Analyze Intentionality:** Judge the relationship between the agent's action and the outcome:
    - **Intended Outcome:** The outcome was the agent's primary goal or a direct means to achieve that goal.
    - **Knowingly Caused Outcome:** The outcome was **not** the agent's goal, but the agent knew it would occur as a **direct and certain** result of their action aimed at another goal.
    - **Foreseen Side Effect:** The outcome was a predictable but less certain or indirect consequence.
    - **Unforeseen Side Effect:** The outcome was unexpected and unforeseeable.
5.  **Apply the Intentionality Test:** The action is intentional **if** the outcome was:
    a) **Intended** (primary goal or necessary means), **OR**
    b) **Knowingly Caused** (a certain and direct result of the action, which the agent proceeded with in full knowledge of this outcome).
    If the outcome was a **side effect** (foreseen or unforeseen), it was not intentional.
6.  **Output your final answer strictly within the tags: <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.**

**C. Causal Attribution Framework (For "because" questions):**

C1.  **Define the Causal Mechanism:** Extract the precise physical or system-level rule that **directly and sufficiently** produces the outcome. State it as a clear, deterministic rule: **"The outcome occurs if and only if [minimal set of conditions]."**
C2.  **Identify the Outcome:** State the specific event that occurred.
C3.  **Apply the Minimal Counterfactual Test:** For the specific agent and action in question, ask: **"If [Agent] had not performed [Action] at [Time], and everything else had remained exactly the same, would the outcome still have occurred according to the mechanism from Step C1?"**
    - If **no**, then the action was a cause. Answer **Yes**.
    - If **yes**, then it was not. Answer **No**.
C4.  **Output your final answer strictly within the tags: <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.**

**Key Principles to Uphold:**
-   **Intentionality:** Ignore mere causation. An action can cause an outcome without the agent intending it. Your task is to evaluate the agent's mind.
-   **Causation:** Ignore mental state. Base causal judgments solely on the counterfactual test applied to the mechanistic rule.
-   **Consider All Evidence:** Use the agent's stated desires, knowledge, and context to infer their mental state for intentionality judgments.
-   **Avoid Pitfalls:** Do not conflate causation with intention. Do not assume an outcome is intentional just because it was foreseen; it must be intended or knowingly caused.

**Few-Shot Examples:**

**Example (Intentionality - Knowingly Caused):**
Input: [The Hunter and the Bird-watcher example]
Reasoning: [Classify: Intentionality]
I1. Action: Firing the gun at the deer. Outcome: The bullet hits a bird-watcher.
I2. Mechanism: A bullet fired on that trajectory will certainly pass through the deer and hit a person behind it.
I3. Mental State: Primary goal was to kill the deer and win. The agent knew with certainty that hitting a bird-watcher would directly result from this action. He was indifferent.
I4. Analysis: Hitting the bird-watcher was not the goal, but it was a **knowingly caused** outcome.
I5. Intentionality Test: Outcome was knowingly caused, therefore it was intentional.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example (Intentionality - Side Effect):**
Input: [Joe and the commemorative cup example]
Reasoning: [Classify: Intentionality]
I1. Action: Purchasing the Mega-Sized Smoothie. Outcome: Obtaining the cup.
I2. Mechanism: The cup is provided if and only if a Mega-Sized Smoothie is purchased.
I3. Mental State: Joe's primary goal was to get the largest smoothie. He did not care about the cup.
I4. Analysis: The cup was a foreseen side effect. It was not his goal, a means, nor knowingly caused (he didn't need to cause it to achieve his goal; it was a concurrent effect).
I5. Intentionality Test: Outcome was a side effect, not intended.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example (Causal Attribution):**
Input: [David and the Dryer example]
Reasoning: [Classify: Causal Attribution]
C1. Mechanism: The clothes dry in 60 minutes if and only if (cycle = MAX DRY OR temp = HIGH).
C2. Outcome: Clothes dried in 60 minutes.
C3. Counterfactual Test: If David *had* changed the temperature setting (e.g., to LOW), then the condition (temp = HIGH) would have been false. However, the other condition (cycle = MAX DRY) was still true, so the outcome would still have occurred. Therefore, his inaction was **not** a necessary cause.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example (Causal Attribution - Positive):**
Input: "A printer has a paper jam if both trays are empty. Alice checks tray 1, sees it's empty, but does not check or refill tray 2. The printer jams. Did the jam happen because Alice didn't refill tray 2?"
Reasoning: [Classify: Causal Attribution]
C1. Mechanism: Jam occurs if and only if (tray1 is empty AND tray2 is empty).
C2. Outcome: Printer jammed.
C3. Counterfactual Test: If Alice *had* refilled tray 2, then the condition (tray2 is empty) would be false, breaking the necessary AND condition. The jam would **not** have occurred. Therefore, her inaction was a cause.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these steps:

**Step 0: Classify the Question Type**
*   First, determine what is being asked:
    *   If the question contains words like "intentionally," "accidentally," "knowingly," or "on purpose," it is about **intentionality**. Proceed to **Path A**.
    *   If the question contains words like "responsible," "blame," "fault," or "negligent," it is about **blame/responsibility**. Proceed to **Path B**.
    *   Otherwise, the question is about **physical causation** (e.g., "cause," "prevent," "lead to"). Proceed to **Path C**.

**PATH C: FOR PHYSICAL CAUSATION QUESTIONS**

1.  **Define the Specific Outcome Token:** Precisely describe the outcome as the exact physical event that occurred at a specific time and place. Avoid general descriptions. (e.g., "The specific instance of the motion detector being triggered at 9:00:00 AM in the designated room on October 26th," not just "the detector went off").

2.  **Identify the Causal Mechanism:** Determine the most direct physical rule that produces the outcome. State it as a clear conditional rule (e.g., "The outcome occurs if and only if [precise physical condition] is met.").

3.  **Define the Agent's Specific Contribution:**
    *   **Action:** If the agent performed a specific physical motion, define it as: "[Agent]'s body performing [specific motion] at [time]." (e.g., "Billy's body moving into the room at 9:00:00 AM.").
    *   **Omission:** If the question is about the agent *not* doing something, ask: "Did the agent have a specific, contextually expected duty or ability to intervene and prevent the outcome?" If **no**, then the omission is a background condition, not a cause. If **yes**, then treat the omission as a potential cause and define it as: "[Agent]'s body refraining from [specific motion] at [time]."

4.  **Apply the Proximate Cause Test:** For the action/omission from step 3, ask: "Holding all other background conditions constant, was this specific contribution a **necessary element within the most proximate set of sufficient conditions** that produced the specific outcome?"
    -   **Standard Counterfactual:** If the contribution had not occurred, would the specific outcome still have occurred **in the exact same way, through the same proximate causal chain?** If **no**, it is a cause.
    -   **Overdetermination & Preemption:** If multiple sufficient causes existed and acted simultaneously, the action is **still a cause**. If one sufficient cause preempts another (making it redundant), focus on the cause that actually initiated the chain.

5.  **Uphold Key Invariants:** Base your reasoning solely on the physical causal chain. **You must ignore:**
    -   Permissions, policies, instructions, or social roles.
    -   The agent's knowledge, intentions, beliefs, or goals.
    -   Character traits, apologies, or negligence.
    -   Merely necessary preconditions; focus on necessity within the actual *proximate sufficient* set.

6.  **Output your final answer within <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.**

**PATH A: FOR INTENTIONALITY QUESTIONS**
*   **Focus on Mental State:** Ignore the physical causal chain from Path C. Instead, determine the agent's goal (what they were trying to achieve) and their belief about how their action would achieve it.
*   **Apply the Intentionality Test:** Did the agent bring about the outcome **knowingly**? That is, did they:
    a) **Believe** their action would certainly or very likely lead to the outcome?
    b) **Act** with the outcome as either their primary goal or a known and accepted side-effect?
    If both (a) and (b) are true, answer **Yes**. If the outcome was an unforeseen accident or mistake, answer **No**.
*   **Output your final answer within <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.**

**PATH B: FOR BLAME/RESPONSIBILITY QUESTIONS**
*   **Focus on Duty and Foreseeability:** Ignore the physical causal chain from Path C. Instead, determine if:
    a) The agent had a **duty or obligation** to act (or not act) in a certain way.
    b) The agent **breached** that duty.
    c) The breach was the **proximate cause** of the outcome (using the refined test from Path C).
    d) The outcome was **reasonably foreseeable**.
    If all four conditions are met, answer **Yes**. Otherwise, answer **No**.

**CRITICAL EXAMPLES FOR REFERENCE:**

**Example 4 (Intentionality - Side Effect):**
*   **Question:** "Did the sniper intentionally disturb the air molecules?"
*   **Correct Path:** Path A (Intentionality).
*   **Reasoning:** The sniper (a) knew with certainty that disturbing air molecules would result from his action, and (b) he willingly performed the action, accepting this outcome. Therefore, he did it knowingly.
*   **Correct Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 5 (Overdetermination):**
*   **Question:** "Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?"
*   **Correct Path:** Path C (Physical Causation).
*   **Reasoning:** The *specific outcome* is the detector going off at 9:00:00 AM. Billy's *specific action* was his body entering at that time. He was part of the actual set of sufficient conditions that triggered the detector. The counterfactual (if Billy hadn't entered, Suzy would have triggered it) describes a different sufficient set, but Billy was still a cause in the actual world.
*   **Correct Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 6 (Omission & Proximate Cause):**
*   **Question:** "Did Joe cause his son's injury by being late?"
*   **Correct Path:** Path C (Physical Causation).
*   **Reasoning:** Joe's omission (not arriving on time) is a but-for cause. However, applying Step 3.5, while Joe had a duty to pick up his son, his delay did not directly cause the injury. The **most proximate sufficient cause** was the drunk driver striking the car. Joe's action set the stage but is too distant to be considered the cause of the injury itself.
*   **Correct Answer:** <answer>No</answer>

**Example 7 (Redundant Cause - Omission):**
*   **Question:** "Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David did not change the temperature setting?"
*   **Correct Path:** Path C (Physical Causation).
*   **Reasoning:** David's *inaction* (refraining from changing the setting) is the focus. The MAX DRY setting was sufficient, making the HIGH setting redundant. However, David's omission *allowed* the HIGH setting to remain part of the actual, sufficient set of conditions that produced the outcome. The counterfactual test is applied to the omission itself: if he *had* changed it (to LOW), the outcome would have still occurred identically via MAX DRY. Therefore, his inaction was not necessary.
*   **Correct Answer:** <answer>No</answer>
onsistent with the other items in the list? (e.g., If every other item is a whole fruit, 'a blackberry' is likely one cluster, not one berry).
  2.  **Scale & Consistency Check:** Does my final count create a massive numerical imbalance? Ensure all items are on a roughly similar scale of 'what counts as one.'
  3.  **Contextual Keyword Check:** Did the user use any keywords that resolve ambiguity? Keywords like `single`, `piece of`, `one`, `bunch of`, `cluster of`, `head of` override all other rules.
  4.  **Accounting Check:** Ensure the list of items in your final reasoning is exhaustive and matches the items you are summing. Double-check your arithmetic.

**Step 6: Reason Step-by-Step**
- List each item you consider relevant and why (especially if filtering by category or resolving unit ambiguity).
- **Clearly state the quantity assigned to each item.**
- List each item you exclude and why.
- Show the arithmetic sum. **Ensure the number of item mentions in your list matches the count in your sum.**

**Critical Avoidance:**
- Do not count objects that are not physical items or are not relevant to the user's question.
- Do not count the number of *types* of objects; count the total number of *individual items*.
- Do not ignore the user's specified category. If they ask "how many vegetables?", only count vegetables.
- **Do not ignore context. If a literal interpretation creates an anomaly, use common sense to interpret the most likely intended meaning and justify your choice.**

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example 1 (Category Query):**
Input: "I have a lamp, a table, three toasters, two couches, and three ovens. How many kitchen appliances do I have?"
Reasoning: The user asks for "kitchen appliances."
- "lamp" (1): Not a kitchen appliance. Exclude.
- "table" (1): Not a kitchen appliance. Exclude.
- "toasters" (3): Toasters are kitchen appliances. Count: 3.
- "couches" (2): Not kitchen appliances. Exclude.
- "ovens" (3): Ovens are kitchen appliances. Count: 3.
Sum: 3 + 3 = 6.
Output: 6

**Example 2 (Resolving Unit Ambiguity):**
Input: "I have a cauliflower, a yam, a stalk of celery, a carrot, three cabbages, three garlics, a head of broccoli, a potato, a lettuce head, and an onion. How many vegetables do I have?"
Reasoning: The user asks for "vegetables." The term "three garlics" is ambiguous. In the context of other items listed with clear whole units ("head of broccoli," "lettuce head," "stalk of celery"), it is most reasonable to infer that "three garlics" refers to three whole bulbs of garlic. Therefore, we count it as 3.
- a cauliflower (1) â†’ vegetable. Count: 1
- a yam (1) â†’ vegetable. Count: 1
- a stalk of celery (1) â†’ vegetable. Count: 1
- a carrot (1) â†’ vegetable. Count: 1
- three cabbages (3) â†’ vegetable. Count: 3
- three garlics (3) â†’ vegetable (inferred as bulbs). Count: 3
- a head of broccoli (1) â†’ vegetable. Count: 1
- a potato (1) â†’ vegetable. Count: 1
- a lettuce head (1) â†’ vegetable. Count: 1
- an onion (1) â†’ vegetable. Count: 1
Sum: 1+1+1+1+3+3+1+1+1+1 = 14
Output: 14

**Example 3 (Handling Semantic Ambiguity - CRITICAL):**
Input: "I have a banana, a strawberry, a plum, an apple, a peach, a nectarine, four oranges, and a blackberry. How many fruits do I have?"
Reasoning: The user asks for "fruits." "A blackberry" is a high-ambiguity noun. In this context, it is listed among other whole fruits like apples and peaches. It is implausible that the user has one tiny berry alongside several larger fruits; it is far more likely that "a blackberry" refers to one cluster (a standard aggregate unit), which contains many small drupelets. However, for the purpose of counting *fruits*, we count the cluster as a single unit, just like we count an apple as a single unit.
- a banana (1) â†’ fruit. Count: 1
- a strawberry (1) â†’ fruit. (A strawberry is one individual fruit unit). Count: 1
- a plum (1) â†’ fruit. Count: 1
- an apple (1) â†’ fruit. Count: 1
- a peach (1) â†’ fruit. Count: 1
- a nectarine (1) â†’ fruit. Count: 1
- four oranges (4) â†’ fruit. Count: 4
- a blackberry (1) â†’ fruit (inferred as one cluster). Count: 1
Sum: 1+1+1+1+1+1+4+1 = 11
Output: 11

Now, apply this exact process to the user's query. Think step by step and state the final total.

*   If an item begins with a number word ("two", "three") or a digit ("2"), that number is the quantity (e.g., "three books" -> (book, 3)).
*   If an item begins with "a" or "an", the quantity is 1 (e.g., "an apple" -> (apple, 1)).
*   **Rule for Conjunctions:** For phrases like "two apples and pears", the number applies only to the first object. Treat it as (apple, 2) and (pear, 1). Only if stated as "two apples and two pears" do you get two pairs of (apple, 2) and (pear, 2).
*   **Rule for Containers:** Treat container phrases as the container itself. "A box of pencils" is (box, 1), not (pencil, X), unless the query specifically asks for the contents.
*   **Rule for Compound Nouns:** Treat hyphenated or multi-word nouns as a single object (e.g., "brother-in-law" -> (brother-in-law, 1)).

**Step 2: Categorize and Filter**
If the user's query specifies a category (e.g., "fruits"), you must filter the list.
*   Examine each (object, quantity) pair. Determine if the object belongs to the specified category using common sense and typical usage.
*   Create a new list containing **only** the pairs that are members of the category.
*   **Explicitly list the pairs you are keeping and the pairs you are discarding** to avoid hidden errors.

**Step 3: Enumerate and Calculate**
This step is critical. To prevent arithmetic errors, you must:
*   Extract **only the numerical quantities** from the filtered list of pairs.
*   List these numbers in a clear, comma-separated sequence (e.g., "1, 1, 2, 3").
*   **Perform the sum incrementally and out loud** in your reasoning. Double-check your addition by adding the numbers in a different order.

**Step 4: Output the Final Answer**
Present your final answer clearly within <answer> tags. You must show your complete working for Steps 1-3 before providing the answer.

### **Learn from These Examples to Avoid Common Failures**

**Failure Example 1: Arithmetic Error**
*   **Input:** "I have a strawberry, a grape, a trombone, a nectarine, two bananas, three oranges, an apple, a plum, a clarinet, three blackberries, and an accordion. How many fruits do I have?"
*   **Incorrect Output:** 12 (The model listed the correct numbers but summed 1+1+1+2+3+1+1+3 incorrectly as 12).
*   **Correct Process:**
    *   **Step 1:** (strawberry,1), (grape,1), (trombone,1), (nectarine,1), (banana,2), (orange,3), (apple,1), (plum,1), (clarinet,1), (blackberry,3), (accordion,1)
    *   **Step 2:**
        *   Keep (fruits): (strawberry,1), (grape,1), (nectarine,1), (banana,2), (orange,3), (apple,1), (plum,1), (blackberry,3)
        *   Discard (non-fruits): (trombone,1), (clarinet,1), (accordion,1)
    *   **Step 3:** Quantities: 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3.
        *   Sum: 1+1=2; 2+1=3; 3+2=5; 5+3=8; 8+1=9; 9+1=10; 10+3=13.
    *   **Step 4:** <answer>13</answer>

**Failure Example 2: Misparsing Conjunctions**
*   **Input:** "I have two apples and pears. How many fruits?"
*   **Incorrect Process:** Assuming "two apples and pears" means two of each, leading to (apple,2), (pear,2) and a sum of 4.
*   **Correct Process (Applying Rule for Conjunctions):**
    *   **Step 1:** This is parsed as two items: "two apples" -> (apple, 2) and "pears" -> (pear, 1). It does NOT mean "two pears".
    *   **Step 2:** Keep both (apple,2) and (pear,1).
    *   **Step 3:** Quantities: 2, 1. Sum: 3.
    *   **Step 4:** <answer>3</answer>

You are an expert at accurately parsing, contextualizing, and counting items from descriptive lists. Your task is to analyze the user's input, identify all mentioned objects and their quantities, and provide the correct total count based on a logical interpretation of the scenario.

**Follow this procedure precisely:**

1.  **Parse and Normalize:** Read the entire input. Break down the list into individual items. For each item, extract a clear **(object, quantity)** pair.
    *   If an item starts with a number word (e.g., "four", "two") or a digit (e.g., "4"), use that number as the quantity (e.g., "four beds" -> (bed, 4)).
    *   If an item starts with "a" or "an", the quantity is 1 (e.g., "a lamp" -> (lamp, 1)).
    *   **If an item is a plural noun with no preceding number (e.g., "drums", "chairs"), the default quantity is 1. Treat it as a single entity or category.**
    *   **Handle Common Phrases:**
        *   **"a pair of X" -> (X, 2)**
        *   **"a dozen X" -> (X, 12)**
        *   **"X and Y" (without quantities) -> (X, 1), (Y, 1)**

2.  **Categorize and Filter:** If the question specifies a type of object (e.g., "fruits"), determine which (object, quantity) pairs belong to that category. Ignore all others.

3.  **Contextual Disambiguation (CRITICAL STEP):**
    *   **Review the initial (object, quantity) pairs.**
    *   **Critically analyze the context of the entire input and the specific question being asked.**
    *   **A plural object (e.g., "drums") assigned a quantity greater than 1 based on its prefix (e.g., "three drums" -> (drum, 3)) should be interpreted as representing multiple discrete, countable items.** The word "drums" itself does not represent one single object; the quantity "3" defines how many of that object there are.
    *   **The final count must reflect the total number of discrete physical items or entities, not the number of descriptive phrases.**

4.  **List and Sum:** Mentally list all relevant and contextually disambiguated (object, quantity) pairs to ensure none are missed. Sum all the quantities from these pairs.

5.  **Output:** State the final total.

**Learn from these examples to avoid common pitfalls:**

**Example A (Incorrect - Phrase Miscounting):**
*   **Input:** "I have a lamp, a microwave, a table, a fridge, a stove, four beds, a toaster, an oven, two couches, and a chair. How many objects do I have?"
*   **Incorrect Process:** Adding the *phrases*: 1 (lamp) + 1 (microwave) + ... + 1 (four beds) + ... + 1 (two couches) + ... = 13.
*   **Correct Process:** The phrases "four beds" and "two couches" describe 4 and 2 objects, respectively.
    *   Pairs: (lamp,1), (microwave,1), (table,1), (fridge,1), (stove,1), (bed,4), (toaster,1), (oven,1), (couch,2), (chair,1)
    *   **Sum: 1+1+1+1+1+4+1+1+2+1 = 14**
    *   **<answer>14</answer>**

**Example B (Incorrect - Filtering Error):**
*   **Input:** "I have a raspberry, a blackberry, three nectarines, a banana, two clarinets, a peach, a plum, a strawberry, a violin, a grape, a trumpet, and an orange. How many fruits do I have?"
*   **Incorrect Process:** Missing the "orange" or including non-fruits.
*   **Correct Process:**
    *   Pairs: (raspberry,1), (blackberry,1), (nectarine,3), (banana,1), (clarinets,2)[ignore], (peach,1), (plum,1), (strawberry,1), (violin,1)[ignore], (grape,1), (trumpet,1)[ignore], (orange,1)
    *   Filter for fruits: (raspberry,1), (blackberry,1), (nectarine,3), (banana,1), (peach,1), (plum,1), (strawberry,1), (grape,1), (orange,1)
    *   **Sum: 1+1+3+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 11**
    *   **<answer>11</answer>**

**Example C (Incorrect - Contextual Disambiguation):**
*   **Input:** "I have a piano, three drums, a clarinet, a trumpet, an accordion, a violin, a trombone, and four flutes. How many musical instruments do I have?"
*   **Incorrect Process (Literal Parse):** (piano,1), (drum,3), (clarinet,1), (trumpet,1), (accordion,1), (violin,1), (trombone,1), (flute,4). Sum: 1+3+1+1+1+1+1+4 = 12.
*   **Error:** Failing to see that "three drums" means three individual instruments, not one phrase worth 3. The quantity '3' is the count for the object 'drum'.
*   **Correct Process (Contextual):** The question asks for a count of instruments. Each quantified object represents that many discrete items.
    *   Pairs: (piano,1), (drum,3), (clarinet,1), (trumpet,1), (accordion,1), (violin,1), (trombone,1), (flute,4)
    *   **Sum: 1 (piano) + 3 (individual drums) + 1 (clarinet) + 1 (trumpet) + 1 (accordion) + 1 (violin) + 1 (trombone) + 4 (individual flutes) = 13**
    *   **<answer>13</answer>**

**Now, apply this precise, step-by-step procedure to the user's query below.** First, parse the input into initial (object, quantity) pairs. Then, filter if necessary. Next, perform the critical **Contextual Disambiguation** step. Finally, sum the quantities to get your final answer.

You are an expert at accurately parsing and counting items from descriptive lists. Your task is to analyze the user's input, identify all mentioned objects and their quantities, and provide the correct total count.

**Follow this procedure precisely:**

1.  **Parse and Normalize:** Read the entire input. Break down the list into individual items. For each item, extract a clear **(object, quantity)** pair by following these rules in order:
    *   **Digits and Number Words:** If an item begins with a digit (e.g., "4") or a number word (e.g., "four", "two"), that number is the quantity. Identify the core object described (e.g., "four beds" -> (bed, 4)).
    *   **Indefinite Articles:** If an item begins with "a" or "an", the quantity is 1. Identify the core object described (e.g., "a lamp" -> (lamp, 1)).
    *   **Descriptive Units:** For items containing descriptive units (e.g., "a head of broccoli", "a stalk of celery", "a bunch of grapes"):
        *   The quantity is **always 1** for the entire phrase. Your task is to identify the core **[object]** (e.g., "a head of broccoli" -> (broccoli, 1); "a stalk of celery" -> (celery, 1)).
        *   **Exception for "pair of":** The phrase "a pair of [object]" is a special case and should be parsed as `([object], 2)` (e.g., "a pair of shoes" -> (shoes, 2)).
    *   **Final Object Identification:** Strip away descriptive words (e.g., "red", "big") and units ("head of", "stalk of", "bunch of") to find the core, countable object. The entire noun phrase should be treated as a single, countable unit unless the "pair of" exception applies.

2.  **Categorize and Filter:** If the question specifies a type of object (e.g., "fruits"), determine which (object, quantity) pairs belong to that category. Use common culinary or everyday classification if there is ambiguity (e.g., treat a tomato as a vegetable). Ignore all objects clearly not in the category.

3.  **List and Sum:** Mentally list all relevant (object, quantity) pairs to ensure none are missed. Sum all the quantities from these pairs.

4.  **Output:** State the final total.

**Learn from these examples:**

**Example A (Incorrect):**
*   **Input:** "I have a lamp, a microwave, a table, a fridge, a stove, four beds, a toaster, an oven, two couches, and a chair. How many objects do I have?"
*   **Incorrect Process:** Adding "four beds" as 1 item and "two couches" as 1 item: 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 10.
*   **Error:** The phrases "four beds" and "two couches" represent 4 and 2 objects *each*. Their quantities *are* the sum for that object type.
*   **Correct Process:**
    *   (lamp, 1), (microwave, 1), (table, 1), (fridge, 1), (stove, 1), (bed, 4), (toaster, 1), (oven, 1), (couch, 2), (chair, 1)
    *   Sum: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = **14**

**Example B (Incorrect):**
*   **Input:** "I have a raspberry, a blackberry, three nectarines, a banana, two clarinets, a peach, a plum, a strawberry, a violin, a grape, a trumpet, and an orange. How many fruits do I have?"
*   **Incorrect Process:** Missing the "orange" and not properly accounting for all fruit pairs.
*   **Correct Process:**
    *   Pairs: (raspberry,1), (blackberry,1), (nectarine,3), (banana,1), (clarinets,2)[ignore], (peach,1), (plum,1), (strawberry,1), (violin,1)[ignore], (grape,1), (trumpet,1)[ignore], (orange,1)
    *   Filter for fruits: (raspberry,1), (blackberry,1), (nectarine,3), (banana,1), (peach,1), (plum,1), (strawberry,1), (grape,1), (orange,1)
    *   Sum: 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **11**

**Example C (New - Demonstrating Units):**
*   **Input:** "I have a head of lettuce, a bunch of grapes, a stalk of celery, and a pair of apples. How many items do I have?"
*   **Process:**
    *   Parse:
        *   "a head of lettuce" -> (lettuce, 1)  // Unit "head of" is stripped, quantity is 1.
        *   "a bunch of grapes" -> (grapes, 1)    // Unit "bunch of" is stripped, quantity is 1 for the bunch.
        *   "a stalk of celery" -> (celery, 1)    // Unit "stalk of" is stripped, quantity is 1.
        *   "a pair of apples" -> (apples, 2)     // "Pair of" is a special case meaning two.
    *   Filter: The question asks for "items," so all are included.
    *   Sum: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **5**
*   **Explanation:** Note how units like "head", "bunch", and "stalk" are part of the description and do not change the quantity. Only "pair of" has a specific numerical meaning. Each phrase represents one countable unit.

**Now, apply this precise, step-by-step procedure to the user's query below.** First, parse the input into (object, quantity) pairs. Then, filter if necessary. Finally, sum the quantities to get your final answer.
cient to bring about the outcome?"** A good test is: "If we described how the outcome actually happened, would describing the agent's action/inaction be a relevant and non-redundant part of that story?"
    *   **Special Case for Overdetermination (Redundant Causes):** If multiple sufficient pathways exist (A OR B), the outcome can be attributed to an action/inaction if it was part of the sufficient set that *actually* operated. It does not matter if another sufficient set existed but was not used.
    *   **Special Case for Conjunctive Causes (A AND B):** If the outcome requires multiple independent factors, a single necessary action is still *a* cause. However, use caution if attributing the outcome to one factor would be misleading because other factors were equally vital and active. A necessary action is typically a cause unless it was a mere background condition.
    *   **If yes:** Then the outcome can be attributed to the action/inaction. Proceed to step 4.
    *   **If no:** Then the outcome did not happen because of it.

4.  **Evaluate causal proximity and salience:**
    *   A cause, even if necessary or sufficient, may be too remote if its connection to the outcome is superseded.
    *   Check for a **new, independent, intentional agent** (e.g., a person making a free choice) or an **unforeseeable event** that breaks the direct chain of causation.
    *   **Also consider:** Is there another cause that is **overwhelmingly more dominant or salient** (e.g., a terminal illness, a highly improbable event) that reduces the importance of the agent's action in explaining the specific outcome?

5.  **Synthesize and conclude:**
    *   An action/inaction is a cause if it was a **salient and important difference-maker** for the specific outcome. It must be either necessary *or* part of the actual sufficient set that operated, **and** it must not be preempted by a more proximate, intervening, or dominant cause.
    *   Avoid attributing causation if the action was merely one of many equally necessary conditions in a conjunctive setup *and* other factors were equally active, making single attribution misleading, or if the outcome was destined to happen in almost the same way regardless.

**Guidance Examples:**

**Example 1: Necessary Action (Conjunctive Cause)**
Question: Did Jim turning on his lamp cause the circuit breaker to fail? (Context: Breaker fails if 3+ lamps are on. Jim, Carol, and Bob all turned on their lamps.)
Reasoning: The outcome is "breaker failed at that moment." If Jim had not acted, only two lamps would be on, and the breaker would not have failed (necessary). Jim's action was part of the actual sufficient set (Jim+Carol+Bob) that operated. All three were active, but Jim's action was a genuine difference-maker.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2: Overdetermined Inaction (Not a Cause)**
Question: Did the motorboat start because Ned did not change the position of the motor? (Context: Start condition is neutral OR lock. Gear was neutral, motor was lock.)
Reasoning: The outcome is "boat started when Ned turned the key." If Ned had changed the motor's position, the boat would still have started due to the neutral gear (not necessary). The outcome was achieved through the mechanism of the neutral gear. The motor lock was a redundant condition; Ned's inaction did not contribute to the actual causal chain.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3: Overdetermined Inaction (Is a Cause)**
Question: Did the device charge because Anna did not unplug it? (Context: It was on a charging pad, but a backup battery was also available.)
Reasoning: The outcome is "the device charged." If Anna had unplugged it, the backup would have charged it (not necessary). However, the outcome occurred *through the mechanism* of it being left plugged in; the backup was not used. Her inaction was part of the actual sufficient set.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4: Intervening Cause**
Question: Did Joe cause his son's injury? (Context: Joe's delay led to his neighbor driving the child, and a drunk driver hit the neighbor's car.)
Reasoning: The outcome is "son's injury." Joe's delay was necessary for the child to be in the car. However, the **intervening, intentional, and unforeseeable act of the drunk driver** is the proximate and salient cause, superseding Joe's remote action.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 5: Temporal Specificity**
Question: Did misadministration of medication cause John's premature death? (Context: John had terminal cancer but died immediately from a drug error.)
Reasoning: The specific outcome is "premature death at that moment." If the nurse had *not* administered the wrong medication, John would *not* have died at that moment. The action was necessary for this specific outcome. The cancer is a background condition.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 6: Conjunctive Causes (Misleading Attribution)**
Question: Did Joe's first choice cause him to win a dollar? (Context: Winning requires a green ball from the left box AND a blue ball from the right box.)
Reasoning: The outcome is "winning a dollar." Joe's first choice was necessary. However, the win required two independent events. The outcome was achieved through the mechanism of *both choices combined*. The first choice alone is not a sufficient explanation for the win; the second choice is an equally necessary and active part of the causal story. Therefore, single attribution is misleading.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

After your reasoning, output your final answer as <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.

Answer questions about causal attribution by evaluating whether an outcome occurred because of a specific agent's action or inction. Follow these reasoning steps carefully:

1.  **Identify the agent's action/inaction and the outcome.**
    *   Precisely define the **outcome** based on the question's wording. Pay close attention to the specificity and timing of the event.
    *   **Identify the normative context:** Are there rules, permissions, or social norms that define expected behavior?

2.  **Determine the nature of the causal question:**
    *   Is the question asking if the action/inaction was a *necessary condition* for the outcome (a "but-for" cause)?
    *   Or is it asking if the action/inaction was a *relevant part of the actual causal process* that led to the outcome (an "actual cause")?

3.  **Apply dual-path reasoning:**
    *   **Path A: Counterfactual Necessity ("But-for" Cause)**
        *   Consider what would have happened if the agent had done the *opposite* of their actual action/inaction.
        *   **If the outcome would have been prevented or significantly different,** then the action/inaction was a necessary cause. This supports a "Yes" answer.
        *   **If the outcome would have occurred in the exact same way regardless** due to another sufficient condition, then it was not a necessary cause. This supports a "No" answer.
    *   **Path B: Actual Causation & Agency**
        *   **B1. Causal Process:** Was the agent's action/inaction part of the **actual set of conditions** that were sufficient for the outcome?
        *   **B2. Intentional & Normative Agency:** Did the agent have **knowledge and intent** relevant to the outcome?
            *   For **inaction**: Did the agent *know* a condition was sufficient and chose not to change it?
            *   For **action**: Was the agent **aware of the relevant rules, norms, and likely consequences?** An action that is *permitted, routine, or ignorant* is less likely to be considered "the cause" compared to a *forbidden, abnormal, or knowing* action.
        *   **B3. Superseding Cause:** Did a new, independent event **intervene** between the agent's action and the outcome, becoming the direct proximate cause?

4.  **Synthesize the paths to reach a final judgment:**
    *   Weigh the results of all paths. **Apply the following hierarchy:**
        *   **First, check for Superseding Causes (B3).** If present, they typically negate prior causes for the specific outcome.
        *   **Next, apply the Normative Salience Filter.** **Even if an action is an actual cause (B1) or a but-for cause (Path A), if it is a *normal, permitted, or routine* part of the background context, and the outcome was directly made salient by an *abnormal, violating* action, then attribute causation to the abnormal action. Answer "No" for the routine action.**
        *   **Then, weigh the evidence:**
            *   **Typically answer "Yes" if:**
                *   The action was a but-for cause (Path A) **AND** it is normatively salient (not a routine background condition), **OR**
                *   The action was part of the actual sufficient set (B1) **AND** the agent's involvement was knowing and intentional (B2) within the context.
            *   **Typically answer "No" if:**
                *   The action was not a but-for cause (Path A) **AND** it was not a knowing part of the actual sufficient set (fails B2), **OR**
                *   It was a but-for cause but is a normal background condition overshadowed by a more salient, abnormal cause (Normative Salience Filter).
    *   **Special Case - Multiple Sufficient Causes:** If multiple actions are actual causes (B1), the more *unlikely*, *abnormal*, or *active* factor is the primary cause. Attribute causation to the violating or unexpected action.

5.  **Focus on the specific action mentioned:** Ensure your reasoning directly addresses the action cited in the question.

**Guidance from Examples:**

**Example 1 (Informed inaction as cause, even with another sufficient condition):**
Question: Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Reasoning:
- *Path A (Counterfactual):* If Wayne had moved the device, it would still have been charged by the plug. It was not a necessary condition.
- *Path B (Intentional):* Wayne checked the device's position and *knowingly* chose not to move it. This informed inaction was a deliberate decision to preserve a sufficient condition for the outcome.
- *Synthesis:* Although not necessary, the inaction was a knowing contribution. Therefore, it happened because of his action.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Inaction not a cause due to sufficiency of another condition):**
Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David did not change the temperature setting?
Reasoning:
- *Path A (Counterfactual):* If David had changed the temperature, the clothes would still have dried on the MAX DRY cycle. His inaction was not necessary.
- *Path B (Intentional):* The scenario does not emphasize David's knowledge or intent regarding the sufficiency of the MAX DRY cycle. His inaction is not portrayed as a key, knowing contribution.
- *Synthesis:* The inaction was neither necessary nor a salient part of the causal process.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Failure Case - Ignorant Inaction Overridden by Necessity):**
Question: Did the houseplant die because Sarah did not water it?
*Assume Sarah was on vacation and unaware the automatic watering system had broken.*
Reasoning:
- *Path A (Counterfactual):* If Sarah had watered it, the plant would not have died. Her inaction was a necessary condition.
- *Path B (Intentional):* Sarah was ignorant of the need to water the plant. Her inaction was not a knowing choice.
- *Synthesis:* The strong signal from Path A (necessity) overrides the lack of intent. The outcome happened because she did not water it.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Failure Case - Salience of an Unlikely Cause):**
Question: Did Joe's first choice cause him to win a dollar? (He drew a likely green ball from the left box and an unlikely blue ball from the right box to win).
Reasoning:
- *Path A (Counterfactual):* Both choices were necessary. Without the green ball, he would not have won.
- *Path B (Actual Cause):* Both actions were part of the actual causal process.
- *Synthesis:* However, drawing the green ball was a likely, normal background condition. Drawing the unlikely blue ball was the salient, difference-making cause. Therefore, the win did not happen *because of* the first choice.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 (Normative Salience Overrides Physical Causation):**
Question: Did the administrative assistant cause the problem? (Pens scenario)
Reasoning:
- *Path A (Counterfactual):* The assistant's action may have been necessary for the depletion, depending on the initial number of pens.
- *Path B (Actual Cause):* The assistant's action was part of the actual causal process (B1). However, her action was *permitted and routine* (B2). The professor's action was *forbidden and abnormal*.
- *Synthesis:* Applying the **Normative Salience Filter**: The "problem" is defined by the violation of the rule. The assistant's action is a normal background condition. The outcome did not happen *because of* her action, but because of the professor's.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 6 (Ignorance Mitigates Causal Attribution):**
Question: Did the hedgehog cause the problem? (Pencils scenario)
Reasoning:
- *Path A (Counterfactual):* The hedgehog's action was a necessary (but-for) cause. Without it, pencils would remain.
- *Path B (Actual Cause):* The action was part of the sufficient set (B1). However, the hedgehog was **ignorant of the rule** (B2). The bear, who knew the rule, also took pencils.
- *Synthesis:* The hedgehog's action was necessary, but his lack of knowledge (B2) reduces his agential role. The bear's informed action is more salient. The problem was not caused *because of* the ignorant hedgehog's action.

Answer questions about causal and intentional attribution by carefully evaluating the agent's action or inaction, the context, and the outcome. Your goal is to determine if the agent's action was a cause of the outcome, considering both factual necessity and normative factors. Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify key elements:**
    -   **Agent:** Who is the question about?
    -   **Action/Inaction:** What did the agent do or fail to do?
    -   **Outcome:** What was the result?
    -   **Context:** Note relevant rules, permissions, obligations, and the agent's knowledge.

2.  **Apply counterfactual reasoning for factual cause:**
    -   First, apply the **"but-for" test**: Consider what would have happened if the agent had done the opposite.
    -   If the outcome would have been prevented or significantly different, the agent's action was a **necessary cause**.
    -   **If the outcome would have occurred anyway (overdetermination):** Determine if the agent's action was part of the **actual sequence** of events that brought about the outcome. If it was a sufficient condition that actually occurred, it is a **contributing factual cause**.
    -   **Also consider:** What would have happened if other relevant agents had acted differently? This helps identify if multiple actions were necessary or if the outcome was overdetermined.

3.  **Evaluate norms and permissions to determine normative status:**
    -   Determine if the action was permitted, obligatory, or forbidden.
    -   **Key Question:** Was the agent's action the **abnormal** or **norm-violating** factor?
    -   **Primary Principle:** When multiple factual causes exist, the action that violated a rule or obligation is often considered the **primary cause** for blame. Permitted or obligatory actions are typically **not** considered blameworthy.
    -   **Critical Distinction:** An action can be a *factual cause* even if it was permitted. The question "Did X cause Y?" often asks about factual causation. The question "Is X responsible for Y?" asks about normative blame. Interpret the question based on this distinction.

4.  **Evaluate intentionality (if applicable):**
    -   For questions about "intentionally" causing an outcome, assess the agent's knowledge and goals.
    -   **Intentional:** The outcome was part of the agent's goal or plan.
    -   **Knowing/Foreseen:** The agent knew the outcome was certain or nearly certain, but it was not their goal. This is often **not** "intentional" in the common-sense meaning of the word, though it may be reckless.
    -   **Unintentional/Reckless:** The outcome was a mere possibility or risk. The agent did not know it was certain.
    -   **Pay close attention to probability words:** 'definitely' vs. 'likely' vs. 'possibly'. Reserve 'intentional' for outcomes the agent aimed to produce.

5.  **Synthesize and conclude:**
    -   Combine insights from above steps.
    -   **For causation:** The agent **caused** the outcome if their action was a factual cause. An action is a factual cause if:
        1.  It was **necessary** for the outcome (passes the "but-for" test). OR
        2.  It was **sufficient** for the outcome and was part of the **actual sequence** of events that produced it, even if other sufficient causes were present (symmetric overdetermination).
    -   This is true even if the action was permitted.
    -   **For blameworthiness:** The agent is **normatively responsible** only if their action was a factual cause *and* violated a norm or obligation.
    -   **For intentionality:** The agent **intentionally** caused the outcome only if it was their goal or plan. If the outcome was merely foreseen as certain but not desired, it is typically **not intentional**.

**How to Interpret the Question:**
-   If the question uses words like "cause", "lead to", or "result in", focus primarily on **factual causation**.
-   If the question uses words like "responsible", "blame", "fault", or "praise", focus on **normative responsibility**.
-   If the question uses "intentionally" or "on purpose", focus on **intentionality**.
-   **Default:** If the question is ambiguous, assume it is asking for factual causation unless the context is heavily normative.

Use the following examples to guide your understanding:

**Example 1 (Intentionality - Foreseen Side Effect):**
Question: Did the sniper intentionally disturb some air molecules?
Reasoning:
- Agent: Sniper. Action: Fired bullet. Outcome: Air molecules disturbed. Context: Disturbance was a certain, known side effect, but not the agent's goal.
- Intentionality: The sniper did not act in order to disturb molecules; it was a foreseen but irrelevant byproduct. This lacks the element of purpose.
- Conclusion: The outcome was not intentional.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 2 (Causation - Symmetric Overdetermination):**
Question: Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on?
Reasoning:
- Agent: Design studio. Action: Arrived at 8:45 am. Outcome: System turned on. Context: Their arrival was permitted and obligatory. The travel agency's arrival was also sufficient.
- Counterfactual: The design studio's arrival was not necessary for the outcome. However, in the actual world, their action was part of the set of events that produced the outcome.
- Norms: No norm violation. The action was normal and expected.
- Conclusion: While not the sole cause, their action was a contributing factual cause in the actual sequence of events.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 3 (Intentionality - Risk vs. Certainty):**
Question: Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?
Reasoning:
- Agent: Hunter. Action: Shot deer. Outcome: Bird-watcher hit. Context: Hunter knew the bullet "*could possibly*" hit a bird-watcher, not that it was certain.
- Intentionality: The agent foresaw a risk, not a certainty. The outcome, while not surprising, was not known to be inevitable. This is recklessness, not intentional action.
- Conclusion: The outcome was not intentional.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 (Causation - Overdetermination & Factual Cause):**
Question: Did Drew cause the coffee shop to make a profit?
Reasoning:
- Agent: Drew. Action: Ordered coffee. Outcome: Profit. Context: Profit requires one order. Kylie and Oliver also ordered. Ordering is permitted.
- Counterfactual: Drew's order was not necessary; profit would have occurred from Kylie or Oliver's orders.
- Actual Sequence: In the actual world, the profit was produced by the set of actions that included Drew's order. His action was a sufficient condition that actually occurred.
- Norms: No norm violation. The question is about factual causation.
- Conclusion: Drew's action was part of the actual causal chain. Therefore, he was a cause of the outcome.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 5 (Causation vs. Blame - Norm Violation):**
Question: Did the security guard cause the prison break?
Reasoning:
- Agent: Security Guard. Action: Did his rounds (obligatory). Outcome: Prison break. Context: A second guard was asleep (forbidden).
- Counterfactual: If the first guard had skipped rounds, the break might have been prevented. However, if the second guard had been awake, it would have been prevented.
- Norms: The first guard was fulfilling his obligation. The second guard violated his duty.
- Conclusion: The sleeping guard's violation is the primary cause. The guard doing his job correctly did not cause the problem.

Answer questions about causal attribution by evaluating whether an outcome occurred because of a specific agent's action or inaction. Follow these reasoning steps carefully and precisely:

1.  **Identify the agent's action/inaction and the specific outcome:** Specify the agent and the exact action or inaction. Crucially, define the outcome **exactly as stated in the question, including its specific timing and context**.

2.  **Apply the counterfactual test for necessity:**
    *   Consider what would have happened if the agent had done the *opposite* of the cited action (e.g., if they acted instead of being inactive, or vice versa).
    *   **Anchor this test to the specific outcome from Step 1.** If the outcome would have been prevented or significantly different, then the action/inaction is a *necessary cause*. Proceed to step 4.
    *   If the outcome would have occurred *unchanged*, then the action/inaction is *not necessary*. Proceed to step 3.

3.  **Evaluate for sufficiency and the actual causal mechanism:**
    *   Even if not necessary, an action/inaction can be a cause if it was part of the actual, sufficient set of conditions that operated.
    *   Ask: **"In the actual sequence of events, was the agent's action/inaction a component of the set of conditions that were sufficient to bring about the outcome?"** A good test is: "If we described how the outcome actually happened, would describing the agent's action/inaction be a relevant and non-redundant part of that story?"
    *   **Special Case for Overdetermination (Redundant Causes):** If multiple sufficient pathways exist (A OR B), the outcome can be attributed to an action/inaction if it was part of the sufficient set that *actually* operated. It does not matter if another sufficient set existed but was not used.
    *   **Special Case for Conjunctive Causes (A AND B):** If the outcome requires multiple independent factors, a single necessary action is still *a* cause. **However, resist attributing the outcome solely to one factor if doing so would provide a misleading or incomplete explanation.** Specifically, if the outcome is best explained by the *combination* of factors, and no single factor is overwhelmingly more salient, improbable, or intentional than the others, then answer "No" to a question asking if one specific factor "caused" the outcome.
    *   **If yes:** Then the outcome can be attributed to the action/inaction. Proceed to step 4.
    *   **If no:** Then the outcome did not happen because of it.

4.  **Evaluate causal proximity and salience:**
    *   A cause, even if necessary or sufficient, may be too remote if its connection to the outcome is superseded.
    *   Check for a **new, independent, intentional agent** (e.g., a person making a free choice) or an **unforeseeable event** that breaks the direct chain of causation.
    *   **Also consider:** Is there another cause that is **overwhelmingly more dominant or salient** (e.g., a terminal illness, a highly improbable event) that reduces the importance of the agent's action in explaining the specific outcome?

5.  **Check for Misleading Single Attribution (Critical for Conjunctive Causes):**
    *   Even if an action is a necessary part of the actual sufficient set, consider if attributing the outcome solely to it would be misleading.
    *   Ask: **"Does identifying this single action as the 'cause' give a distorted picture of how the outcome actually happened?"**
    *   **Key test:** "If we said 'The outcome happened because of [the action]', would a reasonable person be led to believe that this action was the primary or sufficient reason, thereby overlooking other crucial and independent factors that were equally required?"
    *   **If yes,** then the outcome should **not** be attributed to that single action.

6.  **Synthesize and conclude:**
    *   An action/inaction is a cause if it was a **salient and important difference-maker** for the specific outcome. It must be either necessary *or* part of the actual sufficient set that operated, **and** it must not be preempted by a more proximate, intervening, or dominant cause, **and** single attribution must not be misleading.
    *   Avoid attributing causation if the action was merely one of many equally necessary conditions in a conjunctive setup *and* other factors were equally active, making single attribution misleading, or if the outcome was destined to happen in almost the same way regardless.

**Guidance Examples:**

**Example 1: Necessary Action (Conjunctive Cause)**
Question: Did Jim turning on his lamp cause the circuit breaker to fail? (Context: Breaker fails if 3+ lamps are on. Jim, Carol, and Bob all turned on their lamps.)
Reasoning: The outcome is "breaker failed at that moment." If Jim had not acted, only two lamps would be on, and the breaker would not have failed (necessary). Jim's action was part of the actual sufficient set (Jim+Carol+Bob) that operated. All three were active, but Jim's action was a genuine difference-maker. Single attribution is not misleading here as all actions are symmetrical parts of the same causal mechanism.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2: Overdetermined Inaction (Not a Cause)**
Question: Did the motorboat start because Ned did not change the position of the motor? (Context: Start condition is neutral OR lock. Gear was neutral, motor was lock.)
Reasoning: The outcome is "boat started when Ned turned the key." If Ned had changed the motor's position, the boat would still have started due to the neutral gear (not necessary). The outcome was achieved through the mechanism of the neutral gear. The motor lock was a redundant condition; Ned's inaction did not contribute to the actual causal chain.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3: Overdetermined Inaction (Is a Cause)**
Question: Did the device charge because Anna did not unplug it? (Context: It was on a charging pad, but a backup battery was also available.)
Reasoning: The outcome is "the device charged." If Anna had unplugged it, the backup would have charged it (not necessary). However, the outcome occurred *through the mechanism* of it being left plugged in; the backup was not used. Her inaction was part of the actual sufficient set.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4: Intervening Cause**
Question: Did Joe cause his son's injury? (Context: Joe's delay led to his neighbor driving the child, and a drunk driver hit the neighbor's car.)
Reasoning: The outcome is "son's injury." Joe's delay was necessary for the child to be in the car. However, the **intervening, intentional, and unforeseeable act of the drunk driver** is the proximate and salient cause, superseding Joe's remote action.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 5: Temporal Specificity**
Question: Did misadministration of medication cause John's premature death? (Context: John had terminal cancer but died immediately from a drug error.)
Reasoning: The specific outcome is "premature death at that moment." If the nurse had *not* administered the wrong medication, John would *not* have died at that moment. The action was necessary for this specific outcome. The cancer is a background condition.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 6: Conjunctive Causes (Misleading Attribution)**
Question: Did Joe's first choice cause him to win a dollar? (Context: Winning requires a green ball from the left box AND a blue ball from the right box.)
Reasoning: The outcome is "winning a dollar." Joe's first choice was necessary. However, the win required two independent events. The outcome was achieved through the mechanism of *both choices combined*. The first choice alone is not a sufficient explanation for the win; the second choice is an equally necessary and active part of the causal story. Therefore, single attribution is misleading. Saying "Joe won because of his first choice" implies his first choice was sufficient or primary, which is false.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 7: Conjunctive Cause with Salient Difference-Maker (Contrast to Example 6)**
Question: Did the sniper's shot cause the victim's death? (Context: The victim was simultaneously injected with a fast-acting lethal poison by another assassin. Both the bullet and the poison were individually sufficient to cause death at that exact moment.)
Reasoning: The outcome is "death at that moment." This is overdetermination (sufficient causes). The sniper's shot was sufficient and part of the actual causal chain. The poison was also sufficient but redundant. The outcome can be correctly attributed to the sniper's shot. Single attribution is not misleading here because the shot alone provides a complete and accurate explanation for the death.

Answer the following question. First, you must determine what type of question it is:

*   **Type 1: Causal Attribution Question:** The question asks if an outcome occurred *because of* a specific agent's action or inaction. (e.g., "Did X happen because Y did Z?").
*   **Type 2: Intentionality Question:** The question asks if an agent performed a specific action *intentionally*. (e.g., "Did Y do Z intentionally?").

**If the question is a Type 1 (Causal Attribution) question, proceed with the following steps:**

1.  **Identify the agent's action/inaction and the outcome.**
    *   Precisely define the **outcome** based on the question's wording. Pay extreme attention to the specificity and timing of the event.
    *   **Identify the normative context:** Are there rules, permissions, or social norms that define expected behavior?

2.  **Determine the nature of the causal question:**
    *   Is the question asking if the action/inaction was a *necessary condition* for the outcome (a "but-for" cause)?
    *   Or is it asking if the action/inaction was a *relevant part of the actual causal process* that led to the outcome (an "actual cause")?

3.  **Apply dual-path reasoning:**
    *   **Path A: Counterfactual Necessity ("But-for" Cause)**
        *   Consider what would have happened if the agent had done the *opposite* of their actual action/inaction.
        *   **If the outcome would have been prevented or significantly different,** then the action/inaction was a necessary cause. This supports a "Yes" answer.
        *   **If the outcome would have occurred in the exact same way regardless** due to another sufficient condition, then it was not a necessary cause. This supports a "No" answer.
    *   **Path B: Actual Causation & Agency**
        *   **B1. Causal Process:** Was the agent's action/inaction part of the **actual set of conditions** that were sufficient for the outcome?
        *   **B2. Intentional & Normative Agency:** Did the agent have **knowledge and intent** relevant to the outcome?
            *   For **inaction**: Did the agent *know* a condition was sufficient and chose not to change it?
            *   For **action**: Was the agent **aware of the relevant rules, norms, and likely consequences?** An action that is *permitted, routine, or ignorant* is less likely to be considered "the cause" compared to a *forbidden, abnormal, or knowing* action.
        *   **B3. Superseding Cause:** Did a new, independent event **intervene** between the agent's action and the outcome, becoming the direct proximate cause?

4.  **Synthesize the paths to reach a final judgment:**
    *   Weigh the results of all paths. **Apply the following hierarchy:**
        *   **First, check for Superseding Causes (B3).** If present, they typically negate prior causes for the specific outcome.
        *   **Next, apply the Normative Salience Filter.** **Even if an action is an actual cause (B1) or a but-for cause (Path A), if it is a *normal, permitted, or routine* part of the background context, and the outcome was directly made salient by an *abnormal, violating* action, then attribute causation to the abnormal action. Answer "No" for the routine action.**
        *   **Then, weigh the evidence:**
            *   **Typically answer "Yes" if:**
                *   The action was a but-for cause (Path A) **AND** it is normatively salient (not a routine background condition), **OR**
                *   The action was part of the actual sufficient set (B1) **AND** the agent's involvement was knowing and intentional (B2) within the context.
            *   **Typically answer "No" if:**
                *   The action was not a but-for cause (Path A) **AND** it was not a knowing part of the actual sufficient set (fails B2), **OR**
                *   It was a but-for cause but is a normal background condition overshadowed by a more salient, abnormal cause (Normative Salience Filter).
    *   **Special Case - Multiple Sufficient Causes:** If multiple actions are actual causes (B1), the more *unlikely*, *abnormal*, or *active* factor is the primary cause. Attribute causation to the violating or unexpected action.

5.  **Focus on the specific action mentioned:** Ensure your reasoning directly addresses the action cited in the question.

**Guidance from Causal Attribution Examples:**

**Example 1 (Informed inaction as cause, even with another sufficient condition):**
Question: Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Reasoning:
- *Path A (Counterfactual):* If Wayne had moved the device, it would still have been charged by the plug. It was not a necessary condition.
- *Path B (Intentional):* Wayne checked the device's position and *knowingly* chose not to move it. This informed inaction was a deliberate decision to preserve a sufficient condition for the outcome.
- *Synthesis:* Although not necessary, the inaction was a knowing contribution. Therefore, it happened because of his action.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Inaction not a cause due to sufficiency of another condition):**
Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David did not change the temperature setting?
Reasoning:
- *Path A (Counterfactual):* If David had changed the temperature, the clothes would still have dried on the MAX DRY cycle. His inaction was not necessary.
- *Path B (Intentional):* The scenario does not emphasize David's knowledge or intent regarding the sufficiency of the MAX DRY cycle. His inaction is not portrayed as a key, knowing contribution.
- *Synthesis:* The inaction was neither necessary nor a salient part of the causal process.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Failure Case - Ignorant Inaction Overridden by Necessity):**
Question: Did the houseplant die because Sarah did not water it?
*Assume Sarah was on vacation and unaware the automatic watering system had broken.*
Reasoning:
- *Path A (Counterfactual):* If Sarah had watered it, the plant would not have died. Her inaction was a necessary condition.
- *Path B (Intentional):* Sarah was ignorant of the need to water the plant. Her inaction was not a knowing choice.
- *Synthesis:* The strong signal from Path A (necessity) overrides the lack of intent. The outcome happened because she did not water it.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Failure Case - Salience of an Unlikely Cause):**
Question: Did Joe's first choice cause him to win a dollar? (He drew a likely green ball from the left box and an unlikely blue ball from the right box to win).
Reasoning:
- *Path A (Counterfactual):* Both choices were necessary. Without the green ball, he would not have won.
- *Path B (Actual Cause):* Both actions were part of the actual causal process.
- *Synthesis:* However, drawing the green ball was a likely, normal background condition. Drawing the unlikely blue ball was the salient, difference-making cause. Therefore, the win did not happen *because of* the first choice.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 (Normative Salience Overrides Physical Causation):**
Question: Did the administrative assistant cause the problem? (Pens scenario)
Reasoning:
- *Path A (Counterfactual):* The assistant's action may have been necessary for the depletion, depending on the initial number of pens.
- *Path B (Actual Cause):* The assistant's action was part of the actual causal process (B1). However, her action was *permitted and routine* (B2). The professor's action was *forbidden and abnormal*.
- *Synthesis:* Applying the **Normative Salience Filter**: The "problem" is defined by the violation of the rule. The assistant's action is a normal background condition. The outcome did not happen *because of* her action, but because of the professor's.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 6 (Ignorance Mitigates Causal Attribution):**
Question: Did the hedgehog cause the problem? (Pencils scenario)
Reasoning:
- *Path A (Counterfactual):* The hedgehog's action was a necessary (but-for) cause. Without it, pencils would remain.
- *Path B (Actual Cause):* The action was part of the sufficient set (B1). However, the hedgehog was **ignorant of the rule** (B2). The bear, who knew the rule, also took pencils.
- *Synthesis:* The hedgehog's action was necessary, but his lack of knowledge (B2) reduces his agential role. The bear's informed action is more salient. The problem was not caused *because of* the ignorant hedgehog's action.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**If the question is a Type 2 (Intentionality) question, use this alternative framework:**

1.  **Identify the Action and its Specific Description:** Parse the question with extreme care. What is the exact action described? (e.g., "shoot his aunt" is different from "shoot his aunt *in the heart*").
2.  **Determine the Agent's Goal and Plan:** What was the agent's stated or implied goal? What specific series of actions did they plan to execute to achieve that goal?
3.  **Compare the Planned Action to the Actual Action:** Did the agent's physical actions unfold exactly as they planned and intended?
    *   **If yes,** then the action was intentional.
    *   **If no,** determine why not:
        *   **Lack of Skill/Mishap:** Did the agent intend the general action but fail to execute it properly due to a mistake, accident, or lack of skill? (e.g., hand slipping). If so, the *general action* (shooting) may be intentional, but the *specific result* (hitting the heart) was not.
        *   **Ignorance:** Was the agent unaware of a key fact that made the action have a different meaning or result than they intended?
        *   **Superseding Intervention:** Did an external event force a different action?
4.  **Apply the "Specificity of Outcome" Test:** Does the question specify a precise outcome detail (e.g., "in the heart")? If so, the agent must have intended *that specific detail* for the answer to be "Yes". An agent can intend a general outcome (death) without intending the precise manner in which it occurred (a shot to the heart).
5.  **Reach a Judgment:** Based on the comparison between plan and execution, conclude whether the action, *as described with all its specific details in the question*, was performed intentionally.

**Guidance from Intentionality Examples:**

**Example 7 (Intentionality Failure - Accidental Specific Outcome):**
Question: Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?
Reasoning:
- *Action Specificity:* The question specifies "in the heart".
- *Agent's Goal & Plan:* Jake intended to kill his aunt. He planned to do this by aiming and firing his rifle at her.
- *Plan vs. Actual:* Jake's hand slipped. He did not execute his plan flawlessly. The bullet hit the heart due to this accident, not due to his precise aim.
- *Specificity Test:* The outcome specified ("in the heart") was accidental, not intended.
- *Judgment:* Jake intentionally shot *at* his aunt, but he did not intentionally shoot her *in the heart*.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 8 (Intentionality Success - General Outcome):**
Question: Did Jake kill his aunt intentionally?
Reasoning:
- *Action Specificity:* The question specifies the general outcome "kill".
- *Agent's Goal & Plan:* Jake intended to kill his aunt by shooting her.
- *Plan vs. Actual:* He carried out his plan (aiming and firing). The fact that his hand slipped is irrelevant to the general intent to cause death.
- *Specificity Test:* The general outcome (death) was achieved and was intended.
- *Judgment:* Jake intentionally killed his aunt.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

Answer questions about causal attribution by identifying all sufficient causes present in the actual scenario. Follow these reasoning steps precisely:

1.  **Identify Causal Laws:** Extract the rules from the scenario that define what events or combinations of events are sufficient to cause the outcome. A sufficient cause can be a single event OR a conjunction of events that together are sufficient.
2.  **Identify Actual Events:** List the specific events that actually occurred.
3.  **Map Events to Laws:** For each sufficient cause identified in Step 1, check if all its required components actually occurred. If yes, that entire sufficient cause was present. **Crucially, each component of a sufficient conjunctive cause is itself considered a cause.**
4.  **Check for Overdetermination:** If multiple distinct sufficient causes were fully present, then each is a cause.
5.  **Avoid Pitfalls:**
    *   Do not conclude an event is not a cause simply because the outcome would have happened anyway (overdetermination).
    *   Do not conclude an event is not a cause simply because it was not individually sufficient; it may be a necessary part of a sufficient conjunction.

**Example 1 (Overdetermination):**
Question: In a building with two businesses, each with enough employees to trigger the climate system alone, both arrive at the same time. Did one group cause the system to turn on?
Reasoning:
*   Step 1: Causal Law -> The presence of Group A is sufficient. The presence of Group B is also sufficient.
*   Step 2: Actual Events -> Both Group A and Group B arrived.
*   Step 3: Both sufficient causes were present.
*   Step 4: This is overdetermination. Both are causes.
Answer: Yes

**Example 2 (Conjunctive Cause):**
Question: A plant dies only if both Chemical X and Chemical Y are applied. Gardener A applied X. Gardener B applied Y. Did Gardener B cause the plant to die?
Reasoning:
*   Step 1: Causal Law -> The conjunction "X is applied AND Y is applied" is the sufficient cause for death.
*   Step 2: Actual Events -> Gardener A applied X. Gardener B applied Y.
*   Step 3: The sufficient cause "X and Y" was present. Therefore, both Gardener A's and Gardener B's actions are causes.
*   Step 4: No overdetermination.
Answer: Yes

Apply this reasoning to the question.

Answer questions about causal attribution by identifying the actual cause(s) of the outcome. Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify the Outcome and Initial Conditions:** Determine what specific outcome occurred and the state of the world *before* the key action in question. Establish which sufficient conditions were already present at this time.
2.  **Apply the Rules of Sufficiency:** Based on the given rules, identify all conditions that are sufficient to bring about the outcome.
3.  **Establish the Causal Timeline:** Determine the precise order in which the sufficient conditions became true. Identify if a sufficient condition was already active and had initiated the causal process *prior* to the event in question.
4.  **Test for Causal Efficacy (The Difference-Maker Test):** For an event to be a cause, it must have made a difference to the outcome. Ask: "If this specific event had not occurred, would the outcome **still have happened in the exact same way and at the exact same time**?"
    *   If **yes**, the event is **not a cause**; it is a redundant or preempted condition.
    *   If **no**, the event **is a cause**.
5.  **Handle Overdetermination Correctly:** True overdetermination exists only if multiple sufficient causes become active **simultaneously** and independently. If one cause occurs first and preempts the others, it is the sole cause. Do not mistake preemption for overdetermination.

**Example of Preemption (Answer: No):**
Question: Tom changes knob A to on. The safety switch was already off, which was sufficient to cause the implosion at 5:00 PM.
Reasoning: The sufficient condition (safety switch off) was true before Tom acted. If Tom had not turned the knob, the implosion would have occurred identically. Tom's action did not make a difference and is not a cause.
Answer: No

**Example of Simultaneous Overdetermination (Answer: Yes):**
Question: Two groups arrive at the same time, each sufficient to trigger the system.
Reasoning: Both sufficient conditions became true at the same instant. The outcome would not have happened at that exact moment without either one. Both are causes.
Answer: Yes

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the actual scenario. Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify Actual Events:** List all relevant events that actually occurred.
2.  **Identify All Sufficient Causes:** Based on the given rules, list every event that, on its own, constitutes a sufficient condition for the outcome.
3.  **Check for Causal Dependence (The "Difference-Maker" Test):**
    *   For the specific event in question, ask: "In the actual sequence of events, was the outcome **already guaranteed** to happen *before* this event occurred?"
    *   If **yes**, then the event is **redundant** and is not considered a cause, even if it is technically sufficient. The outcome did not happen *because* of it.
    *   If **no**, meaning the event was necessary to complete a sufficient set of conditions that were not already present, then it is a cause.
4.  **Check for Intentionality (If the question asks about intent):**
    *   Determine the agent's primary goal or desire.
    *   An agent **intentionally** causes an outcome **only if**: (a) the outcome was their goal or a necessary means to their goal, and (b) they acted knowing their action would bring it about.
    *   If the outcome was merely a foreseen but undesired side effect, it is not intentional.
5.  **Synthesize and Answer:** Weigh the results from the previous steps. An event is considered a cause if it made a difference (Step 3). The presence of other sufficient causes does not negate causation **unless** the outcome was already guaranteed without the event in question.

**Avoid Common Mistakes:**
-   Do not conclude an event is a cause simply because it is a sufficient condition. It must also be a *difference-maker* in the actual scenario.
-   Do not conflate *causation* with *intentional causation*. Analyze the agent's goals separately.

**Example Applications:**

**Example 1: Coffee Shop Profit**
**Question:** Did Drew ordering coffee cause the profit?
**Reasoning:**
1.  Events: Kylie ordered, Oliver ordered, Drew ordered.
2.  Sufficient Causes: Each individual's order is sufficient.
3.  **Difference-Maker Test:** Was profit already guaranteed before Drew ordered? **Yes.** Kylie and Oliver (who usually order) had already ordered. Drew's order was redundant.
4.  Intentionality: Not asked.
5.  Conclusion: Drew's action did not make a difference; the profit would have occurred without it.
**Answer: No**

**Example 2: Hunter and Eagle**
**Question:** Did the man intentionally cause the eagle to fly away?
**Reasoning:**
1.  Events: Man shot deer, gunshot sounded, eagle flew away.
2.  Sufficient Causes: The gunshot was sufficient.
3.  Difference-Maker Test: The gunshot caused the eagle to fly away; it made a difference.
4.  **Intentionality:** The man's goal was to win the competition by shooting the deer. The eagle flying away was not his goal nor a means to it; it was an undesired side effect. Therefore, he did not intend it.
5.  Conclusion: The man caused the outcome but did not do so intentionally.
**Answer: No**

**Example 3: Motorboat**
**Question:** Did the boat start because Ned changed the motor position?
**Reasoning:**
1.  Events: Gear was in neutral, motor was not in lock, Ned changed motor to lock, Ned turned key, boat started.
2.  Sufficient Causes: Neutral gear (sufficient), motor in lock (sufficient).
3.  **Difference-Maker Test:** Was the outcome (boat starting) already guaranteed before Ned changed the motor? **Yes.** The gear was already in neutral, which was alone sufficient. Ned's change was redundant.
4.  Intentionality: Not asked.
5.  Conclusion: The boat did not start *because* Ned changed the position; it started because the gear was already in neutral.
**Answer: No**

Answer questions about causal attribution by identifying the actual cause(s) of the outcome. Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify the Outcome and Initial Conditions:** Determine what specific outcome occurred and the state of the world *before* the key event in question. Note any conditions that are already present.
2.  **Apply the Rules of Sufficiency:** Based on the given rules, identify all conditions that are sufficient to bring about the outcome.
3.  **Establish the Causal Timeline:** Determine the precise order in which the sufficient conditions became true. Identify if a sufficient condition was already active. Crucially, an agent's **inaction** (not changing something) can be the final part that *completes* or *allows a sufficient condition to persist* until the outcome occurs.
4.  **Test for Causal Efficacy (The Adapted Difference-Maker Test):** For an event to be a cause, it must have made a difference to the outcome.
    *   **If the event is an ACTION (e.g., "Tom turned the knob"):** Ask: "If this action had **not been performed**, would the outcome still have happened in the exact same way and at the exact same time?"
    *   **If the event is an INACTION (e.g., "Tom did not change the knob"):** Ask: "If the agent had **performed the alternative action** (e.g., if they *had changed* the knob), would the outcome still have happened?"
    *   If the answer is **yes**, the event is **not a cause**.
    *   If the answer is **no**, the event **is a cause**.
5.  **Handle Overdetermination Correctly:** True overdetermination exists only if multiple sufficient causes become active **simultaneously** and independently. If one cause occurs first and preempts the others, it is the sole cause. Do not mistake preemption for overdetermination.

**Example of Preemption by Prior Condition (Answer: No):**
Question: Tom changes knob A to on. The safety switch was already off, which was sufficient to cause the implosion at 5:00 PM.
Reasoning: The sufficient condition (safety switch off) was true before Tom acted. If Tom had not turned the knob (the action), the implosion would have occurred identically. Tom's action did not make a difference.
Answer: No

**Example of Simultaneous Overdetermination (Answer: Yes):**
Question: Two groups arrive at the same time, each sufficient to trigger the system.
Reasoning: Both sufficient conditions became true at the same instant. The outcome would not have happened at that exact moment without either one. Both are causes.
Answer: Yes

**Example of Omission as Cause (Answer: Yes):**
Question: The machine will activate if the button is not pressed within 10 seconds. Sarah is ordered to press it if the light turns red. The light turns red. Sarah sees it but chooses not to press the button. The machine activates. Did the machine activate because Sarah did not press the button?
Reasoning: The event is an *inaction* (not pressing). We ask the correct counterfactual: "If Sarah *had pressed* the button, would the outcome have happened?" No, pressing would have prevented activation. Therefore, her not pressing the button made the critical difference and is the cause.
Answer: Yes

**Example of Omission as Not Cause (Answer: No):**
Question: The machine will activate if the button is pressed. Sarah is ordered to press it if the light turns red. The light turns red. Sarah sees it but chooses not to press the button. The machine activates. Did the machine activate because Sarah did not press the button?
Reasoning: The event is an *inaction* (not pressing). The correct counterfactual is: "If Sarah *had pressed* the button, would the outcome have happened?" Yes, the machine would still have activated because the rule requires pressing. Therefore, her inaction did not make a difference and is not a cause.

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully following these reasoning steps. First, determine the question type, then apply the appropriate analysis.

**0. Parse the Question Type:**
*   **Causal Contribution:** Questions like "Did X cause Y?" require the steps below.
*   **Intentionality:** Questions like "Did X intentionally cause Y?" require two conditions: (1) X's action/inaction was a cause of Y (follow steps below), AND (2) X had the goal/desire to bring about Y or knew Y would occur.
*   **Other Concepts:** Identify if the question is about blame, knowledge, or desire, and adjust reasoning accordingly.

**For Causal Contribution Questions:**

1.  **Identify Causal Laws:** Extract all rules defining sufficient causes for the outcome. A sufficient cause can be a single event, a conjunction of events, or an *omission* (the absence of an expected action). Note the required components precisely.
2.  **Identify Actual Events & Omissions:** List all specific events that occurred. **Crucially, also identify relevant *omissions*: the absence of an action that an agent could have performed and had a reasonable expectation to perform.**
3.  **Map to Laws:** For each sufficient cause from Step 1, check if all its required components (events or omissions) were present.
    *   If a sufficient cause was fully present, it is a cause.
    *   **For Conjunctive Causes:** Each component is a cause. However, if the conjunction is symmetric (e.g., "A and B"), avoid attributing the outcome to one component alone unless context justifies it.
    *   **For Omissions:** An omission is a cause if it was necessary for a sufficient cause and the agent could have and should have acted otherwise.
4.  **Check for Overdetermination & Normality:** If multiple *distinct* sufficient causes were present, each is a cause. However, if one cause is **normal/expected** and another is **abnormal/unexpected**, the normal cause is often the primary attribution, even if both are physically sufficient.
5.  **Avoid Pitfalls:**
    *   Do not conclude an event is not a cause simply because the outcome would have happened anyway (overdetermination).
    *   Do not conclude an event is not a cause simply because it was not individually sufficient; it may be a necessary part of a sufficient conjunction.
    *   Do not confuse causal contribution with intentionality.

**Apply this reasoning to the question.**

---

**Example 1 (Overdetermination & Normality):**
Question: The travel agency (normal) and design studio (abnormal) employees both arrived at 8:45 am, triggering the climate system. Did the design studio agents cause it?
Reasoning:
*   Step 0: Causal contribution question.
*   Step 1: Laws: Arrival of travel agency employees is sufficient. Arrival of design studio employees is sufficient.
*   Step 2: Events: Both groups arrived.
*   Step 3: Both sufficient causes were present.
*   Step 4: This is overdetermination. However, the studio's arrival was abnormal. The primary cause is the normal one (travel agency).
*   Answer: No

**Example 2 (Causation by Omission):**
Question: The building implodes if the safety switch is off and knob A is on. Tom, an expert, checked knob A at 4 PM (when it was on) and did nothing. Did Tom's inaction cause the implosion?
Reasoning:
*   Step 0: Causal contribution question.
*   Step 1: Law: "Safety switch off AND knob A on" is sufficient.
*   Step 2: Events: Safety switch off. Knob A on. *Omission:* Tom did not change knob A.
*   Step 3: The sufficient cause was present. Tom's omission was a necessary component because he could have and was expected to act.
*   Answer: Yes

**Example 3 (Symmetric Conjunction):**
Question: A motion detector triggers if more than one person is present. Billy and Suzy both arrived at 9 am. Did Billy cause it to trigger?
Reasoning:
*   Step 0: Causal contribution question.
*   Step 1: Law: "More than one person present" is the sufficient cause. This is a symmetric conjunction of Billy's and Suzy's arrivals.
*   Step 2: Events: Both Billy and Suzy arrived.
*   Step 3: The sufficient cause was present. However, its components are symmetric. We do not attribute the outcome to Billy alone.
*   Answer: No

**Example 4 (Intentionality):**
Question: A sniper fired a bullet, disturbing air molecules. He didn't care about this. Did he intentionally disturb them?
Reasoning:
*   Step 0: Intentionality question. Must check (1) causation and (2) intention.
*   Step 1-3 (Causation): Firing the bullet was sufficient to disturb the molecules. He caused it.
*   Step 0.2 (Intentionality): He did not have the goal/desire to disturb the molecules.
*   Answer: No

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the actual scenario. Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify Actual Events:** List all relevant events that actually occurred.
2.  **Identify All Sufficient Causes:** Based on the given rules, list every event that, on its own, constitutes a sufficient condition for the outcome.
3.  **Check for Causal Dependence (The "Difference-Maker" Test):**
    *   For the specific event in question, ask: "In the actual sequence of events, was the outcome **already guaranteed** to happen *before* this event occurred?"
    *   If **yes**, then the event is **redundant** and is not considered a cause, even if it is technically sufficient. The outcome did not happen *because* of it.
    *   If **no**, meaning the event was necessary to complete a sufficient set of conditions that were not already present, then it is a cause.
4.  **Check for Causal Deviancy and Proximity (For "cause" questions):**
    *   If the causal chain from an agent's action to the outcome is long or involves a highly abnormal, independent, or coincidental event (e.g., a drunk driver crash, a freak accident), then the agent's action may not be the primary cause for attribution.
    *   Ask: "Was the outcome a **foreseeable and direct** result of the action, or was it brought about by a freak occurrence?"
    *   If the path is **deviant**, the primary cause is the abnormal event, and the initial action is merely a background condition.
5.  **Check for Intentionality (If the question asks about intent):**
    *   Determine the agent's primary goal or desire.
    *   An agent **intentionally** causes an outcome **if**:
        *   **(a) Direct Intention:** The outcome was their goal.
        *   **(b) Indirect Intention (Means):** The outcome was a known and inevitable (or highly probable) component of the action they chose to perform to achieve their goal. Even if not desired, if they knowingly use a process that includes it, they intend it.
    *   If the outcome was merely a foreseen but separate and undesired side effect of their action, it is **not** intentional.
6.  **Synthesize and Answer:** Weigh the results from the previous steps. An event is considered **a** cause if it made a difference (Step 3). However, it is considered **the** cause (i.e., the primary cause for attribution) only if it is the most direct, sufficient, and non-deviant cause (Step 4). For intent, apply Step 5.

**Avoid Common Mistakes:**
-   Do not conclude an event is a cause simply because it is a sufficient condition. It must also be a *difference-maker* in the actual scenario.
-   Do not conflate *causation* with *intentional causation*. Analyze the agent's goals separately.
-   Distinguish between a *causal link* and *causal attribution*. An event can be a necessary link in a chain without being the primary cause for which we hold an agent responsible, especially if the chain involves deviant or unforeseeable events.

**Example Applications:**

**Example 1: Coffee Shop Profit**
**Question:** Did Drew ordering coffee cause the profit?
**Reasoning:**
1.  Events: Kylie ordered, Oliver ordered, Drew ordered.
2.  Sufficient Causes: Each individual's order is sufficient.
3.  **Difference-Maker Test:** Was profit already guaranteed before Drew ordered? **Yes.** Kylie and Oliver (who usually order) had already ordered. Drew's order was redundant.
4.  Deviancy: Not applicable.
5.  Intentionality: Not asked.
6.  Conclusion: Drew's action did not make a difference; the profit would have occurred without it.
**Answer: No**

**Example 2: Sniper and the Gun Barrel**
**Question:** Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?
**Reasoning:**
1.  Events: Sniper pulled trigger, gun fired, barrel heated.
2.  Sufficient Causes: Firing the gun is sufficient.
3.  Difference-Maker Test: Was heating guaranteed before pulling the trigger? **No.** The action made a difference.
4.  Deviancy: Not applicable.
5.  **Intentionality:** The sniper's goal was to kill the commander. Heating the barrel was a known and inevitable component of the action (firing the gun) he chose to perform to achieve his goal. Therefore, he intended it, even if he didn't desire it.
6.  Conclusion: The sniper intentionally caused the barrel to heat up.
**Answer: Yes**

**Example 3: Joe and the Drunk Driver**
**Question:** Did Joe cause his son's injury?
**Reasoning:**
1.  Events: Joe helped injured person, was delayed, neighbor drove son home, drunk driver crashed, son was injured.
2.  Sufficient Causes: The drunk driver's crash is the direct sufficient cause.
3.  **Difference-Maker Test:** Was the injury guaranteed before Joe acted? **No.** His delay was a necessary link in the chain.
4.  **Deviancy and Proximity:** The injury was directly caused by a drunk driverâ€”an independent, abnormal, and unforeseeable event. Joe's action merely placed his son in a situation where this abnormal event could affect him. The chain is highly deviant. Therefore, the primary cause is the drunk driver's action, not Joe's.
5.  Intentionality: Not asked.
6.  Conclusion: While Joe's action was a link, the deviant nature of the accident means he is not attributed as the cause.
**Answer: No**

6.  **Determine Proximate Cause for Attribution (The Salience Test):** After identifying all difference-making events, determine the most appropriate cause for attribution. An event that is a necessary condition may not be the salient cause.
    *   **Intervention Test:** A **new, voluntary, and independent action** that occurs after the initial conditions and directly brings about the outcome is typically the proximate cause, superseding prior background conditions.
    *   **Normative Role Test:** An action involving **discretionary judgment** about the outcome itself is a more salient cause than a **ministerial action** that is automatic or routine (e.g., checking stock vs. making a clinical decision).

**Example of Preemption by Prior Condition (Answer: No):**
Question: Tom changes knob A to on. The safety switch was already off, which was sufficient to cause the implosion at 5:00 PM.
Reasoning: The sufficient condition (safety switch off) was true before Tom acted. If Tom had not turned the knob, the implosion would have occurred identically. Tom's action did not make a difference.
Answer: No

**Example of Intervening Cause Superseding Background Condition (Answer: No):**
Question: John worked for 30 years with asbestos, giving him terminal cancer. While in the hospital for this cancer, a nurse administered a drug he was allergic to, causing immediate cardiac arrest and death. Did John's job cause his premature death?
Reasoning: The job (asbestos exposure) made a difference: without it, John would not have had terminal cancer or been in the hospital. However, the nurse's action was a new, voluntary, and independent event that directly caused death. This intervening cause supersedes the background condition of the illness.
Answer: No

**Example of Ministerial vs. Discretionary Action (Answer: No):**
Question: An intern needed two signatures to administer a drug. A pharmacist signed off after a routine stock check. A doctor, against hospital policy, exercised discretion and signed off. The drug was administered and the patient recovered. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the recovery?
Reasoning: The pharmacist's action was necessary and made a difference: without it, the drug would not have been given. However, the action was ministerial (routine check). The doctor's action involved discretionary judgment and was the true barrier to treatment. The doctor's decision is the salient cause for attribution, not the pharmacist's.
Answer: No

**Example of Simultaneous Overdetermination (Answer: Yes):**
Question: Two groups arrive at the same time, each sufficient to trigger the system.
Reasoning: Both sufficient conditions became true at the same instant. The outcome would not have happened at that exact moment without either one. Both are causes.
Answer: Yes

**Example of Omission as Cause (Answer: Yes):**
Question: The machine will activate if the button is not pressed within 10 seconds. Sarah is ordered to press it if the light turns red. The light turns red. Sarah sees it but chooses not to press the button. The machine activates. Did the machine activate because Sarah did not press the button?
Reasoning: The event is an *inaction* (not pressing). We ask the correct counterfactual: "If Sarah *had pressed* the button, would the outcome have happened?" No, pressing would have prevented activation. Therefore, her not pressing the button made the critical difference and is the cause.
Answer: Yes

*   Step 1: Law: "Two people logged on simultaneously" is sufficient.
*   Step 2: Events: Lauren logged on (normal). Jane logged on (abnormal violation). Omission: Jane did not refrain from logging on.
*   Step 3: The sufficient cause (both logged on) was present. Both actions are necessary components.
*   Step 4: This is a conjunctive cause. The company policy breaks the symmetry. Lauren's action was **normal and expected**. Jane's action was **abnormal and a violation**. Therefore, Jane's action is the primary cause.
*   Answer: Yes

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the actual scenario. Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify Actual Events:** List all relevant events that actually occurred.
2.  **Identify All Sufficient Causes:** Based on the given rules, list every event that, on its own, constitutes a sufficient condition for the outcome.
3.  **Check for Causal Dependence (The "Difference-Maker" Test):**
    *   For the specific event in question, ask: "In the actual sequence of events, was the outcome **already guaranteed** to happen *before* this event occurred?"
    *   If **yes**, then the event is **redundant** and is not considered a cause, even if it is technically sufficient. The outcome did not happen *because* of it.
    *   If **no**, meaning the event was necessary to complete a sufficient set of conditions that were not already present, then it is a cause-in-fact.
4.  **Check for Causal Deviancy and Proximity (For "cause" questions):**
    *   An agent's action may not be the primary cause for attribution if the causal chain from their action to the outcome is long or involves:
        *   **(a) Abnormal Events:** A highly abnormal, independent, or coincidental event (e.g., a drunk driver crash, a lightning strike).
        *   **(b) Norm-Violating Interventions:** The **free, deliberate, and norm-violating action of another agent** that exploits the situation created by the first agent.
    *   Ask: "From the perspective of the agent in question, was the outcome a **foreseeable and direct** result of their specific action, given the normal, expected state of the world? Or was it brought about by an abnormal event or the independent, violating action of someone else?"
    *   If the path is **deviant** (due to (a) or (b)), then the primary cause is the abnormal or violating event. The initial agent's action is merely a background condition or enabling factor, not the cause for attribution.
5.  **For Multi-Agent Scenarios:** If the outcome requires actions from multiple agents, ask: "Did the agent in question perform their action in a **normal, expected, or prescribed** manner, while another agent acted in an **abnormal, unexpected, or rule-violating** manner?" If **yes**, this strongly indicates that primary causal attribution falls on the rule-violating agent.
6.  **Check for Intentionality (If the question asks about intent):**
    *   Determine the agent's primary goal or desire.
    *   An agent **intentionally** causes an outcome **if**:
        *   **(a) Direct Intention:** The outcome was their goal.
        *   **(b) Indirect Intention (Means):** The outcome was a known and inevitable (or highly probable) component of the action they chose to perform to achieve their goal. Even if not desired, if they knowingly use a process that includes it, they intend it.
    *   If the outcome was merely a foreseen but separate and undesired side effect of their action, it is **not** intentional.
7.  **Synthesize and Answer:** Weigh the results from the previous steps.
    *   If the event **failed the difference-maker test (Step 3)**, the answer is **No**.
    *   If it **passed Step 3**, it is **a** cause-in-fact.
    *   However, for the final binary answer ("Did X cause Y?"), answer **Yes** only if the event is **both** a difference-maker **and** the causal chain is **non-deviant (Step 4)**.
    *   If the event is a difference-maker but the chain is **deviant** (due to a freak event or another agent's violation), then it is **not** the cause for attribution, and the answer is **No**.

**Avoid Common Mistakes:**
-   Do not conclude an event is a cause simply because it is a sufficient condition. It must also be a *difference-maker* in the actual scenario.
-   Do not conflate *causation* with *intentional causation*. Analyze the agent's goals separately.
-   Distinguish between a *causal link* and *causal attribution*. An event can be a necessary link in a chain without being the primary cause for which we hold an agent responsible, especially if the chain involves deviant or unforeseeable events.
-   In multi-agent scenarios, avoid attributing causation to an agent who acted normally and predictably if the outcome was directly triggered by another agent's abnormal, rule-breaking action.

**Example Applications:**

**Example 1: Coffee Shop Profit (Redundancy)**
**Question:** Did Drew ordering coffee cause the profit?
**Reasoning:**
1.  Events: Kylie ordered, Oliver ordered, Drew ordered.
2.  Sufficient Causes: Each individual's order is sufficient.
3.  **Difference-Maker Test:** Was profit already guaranteed before Drew ordered? **Yes.** Kylie and Oliver had already ordered. Drew's order was redundant.
4.  Deviancy: Not applicable.
5.  Conclusion: Drew's action did not make a difference.
**Answer: No**

**Example 2: Sniper and the Gun Barrel (Intention)**
**Question:** Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?
**Reasoning:**
1.  Events: Sniper pulled trigger, gun fired, barrel heated.
2.  Sufficient Causes: Firing the gun is sufficient.
3.  Difference-Maker Test: Was heating guaranteed before pulling the trigger? **No.**
4.  Deviancy: Not applicable.
5.  **Intentionality:** Heating the barrel was a known and inevitable component of firing the gun, which was his chosen action to achieve his goal. Therefore, he intended it.
**Answer: Yes**

**Example 3: Joe and the Drunk Driver (Deviant Chain)**
**Question:** Did Joe cause his son's injury?
**Reasoning:**
1.  Events: Joe helped injured person, was delayed, neighbor drove son home, drunk driver crashed, son was injured.
2.  Sufficient Causes: The drunk driver's crash is the direct sufficient cause.
3.  **Difference-Maker Test:** Was the injury guaranteed before Joe acted? **No.** His delay was a necessary link.
4.  **Deviancy and Proximity:** The injury was directly caused by a drunk driverâ€”an independent, abnormal, and unforeseeable event. The chain is highly deviant. Therefore, the primary cause is the drunk driver's action.
5.  Conclusion: While Joe's action was a link, the deviant nature of the accident means he is not attributed as the cause.
**Answer: No**

**Example 4: Lauren and the Computer (Norm-Violating Intervention)**
**Question:** Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
**Reasoning:**
1.  Events: Jane (lawfully) logged on at 9:00 am. Lauren (unlawfully) logged on at 9:00 am. Computer crashed.
2.  Sufficient Causes: Two people logging on simultaneously.
3.  **Difference-Maker Test:** Was the crash guaranteed before Jane logged on? **No.** Her login was necessary to complete the sufficient set.
4.  **Deviancy and Proximity:** From Jane's perspective, her lawful action did not directly or foreseeably lead to a crash. The crash was directly caused by Lauren's independent, rule-violating action. The chain is deviant due to a norm-violating intervention.
5.  **Multi-Agent Scenario:** Jane acted in a prescribed manner. Lauren acted in a rule-violating manner.
6.  Conclusion: Although Jane's action was a difference-maker, the deviant nature of the causal chain (triggered by Lauren's violation) means Jane is not the primary cause for attribution.
**Answer: No**

Answer questions about causal attribution by identifying the actual cause(s) of the outcome. Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify the Outcome and Initial Conditions:** Determine what specific outcome occurred and the state of the world *before* the key event in question. Note any conditions that are already present.
2.  **Apply the Rules of Sufficiency:** Based on the given rules, identify all conditions that are sufficient to bring about the outcome.
    *   **For outcomes requiring a persistent state:** A condition is sufficient if its *continued presence* over a required duration will cause the outcome. Any event that *initiates*, *sustains*, or *fails to halt* this state is a potential cause.
3.  **Establish the Causal Timeline:** Determine the precise order in which the sufficient conditions became true. Identify if a sufficient condition was already active. Crucially, an agent's **inaction** (not changing something) can be the final part that *completes* or *allows a sufficient condition to persist* until the outcome occurs.
    *   **Identify Critical Junctures:** For persistent states, note any later points where a potential intervenor could have halted the state before the outcome occurred.
4.  **Test for Causal Efficacy (The Adapted Difference-Maker Test):** For an event to be a cause, it must have made a difference to the outcome.
    *   **If the event is an ACTION (e.g., "Tom turned the knob"):** Ask: "If this action had **not been performed**, would the outcome still have happened in the exact same way and at the exact same time?"
    *   **If the event is an INACTION (e.g., "Tom did not change the knob"):** Ask: "If the agent had **performed the alternative action** (e.g., if they *had changed* the knob), would the outcome still have happened?"
    *   If the answer is **yes**, the event is **not a cause**.
    *   If the answer is **no**, the event **is a cause**.
5.  **Handle Overdetermination Correctly:** True overdetermination exists only if multiple sufficient causes become active **simultaneously** and independently. If one cause occurs first and preempts the others, it is the sole cause. Do not mistake preemption for overdetermination.
6.  **Determine Proximate Cause for Attribution (The Salience Test):** After identifying all difference-making events, determine the most appropriate cause for attribution.
    *   **Intervention Test:** A **new, voluntary, and independent action** that occurs after the initial conditions and directly brings about the outcome is typically the proximate cause, superseding prior background conditions.
    *   **Normative Role Test:** An action involving **discretionary judgment** about the outcome itself is a more salient cause than a **ministerial action** that is automatic or routine.
    *   **Normality Test:** When multiple events are difference-making causes, the event that is **abnormal, surprising, or deviates from the default or expected course of events** is the more salient cause. A highly probable or routine event is less likely to be the primary cause than a highly improbable one.

**Scope of Analysis:** This framework analyzes causal relationships between **events**, where an event can be an Action, an Inaction, or an Outcome of a Process (e.g., a random result). Agency is most relevant for the **Salience Test**.

**Example of Preemption by Prior Condition (Answer: No):**
Question: Tom changes knob A to on. The safety switch was already off, which was sufficient to cause the implosion at 5:00 PM.
Reasoning: The sufficient condition (safety switch off) was true before Tom acted. If Tom had not turned the knob, the implosion would have occurred identically. Tom's action did not make a difference.
Answer: No

**Example of Omission Sustaining a Persistent State (Answer: Yes):**
Question: A tank has a small leak. Guard A's job is to check for leaks at noon and patch them. Guard A sees the leak at noon but does nothing. Guard B, who is not obligated to act, also sees the leak at 1 PM and does nothing. The tank empties and is destroyed at 5 PM. Did Guard B's inaction cause the destruction?
Reasoning: The sufficient condition (leak) is a persistent state. Guard B's inaction is tested with: "If Guard B had patched the leak at 1 PM, would the outcome have been prevented?" Yes. Therefore, Guard B's inaction made a difference by sustaining the sufficient condition and is a cause.
Answer: Yes

**Example of Normality Test for Conjunctive Causes (Answer: No):**
Question: Joe wins by drawing a green ball (likely) from the left box AND a blue ball (very unlikely) from the right. Did drawing the green ball cause the win?
Reasoning: Both draws are necessary difference-makers. However, the green draw was the expected, normal outcome. The blue draw was the abnormal, surprising event without which the win would have been impossible. Applying the Normality Test, the blue draw is the salient cause. The green draw is not the cause for attribution.
Answer: No

**Example of Ministerial vs. Discretionary Action (Answer: No):**
Question: An intern needed two signatures to administer a drug. A pharmacist signed off after a routine stock check. A doctor, against hospital policy, exercised discretion and signed off. The drug was administered and the patient recovered. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the recovery?
Reasoning: The pharmacist's action was necessary but ministerial (routine check). The doctor's action involved discretionary judgment and was the true barrier to treatment. The doctor's decision is the salient cause.
Answer: No

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully following these reasoning steps. First, determine the question type, then apply the appropriate analysis.

**0. Parse the Question Type:**
*   **Causal Contribution:** Questions like "Did X cause Y?" or "Did X's omission cause Y?" require the steps below.
*   **Intentionality:** Questions like "Did X intentionally cause Y?" require two conditions: (1) X's action/inaction was a cause of Y (follow steps below), AND (2) X had the goal/desire to bring about Y or knew Y would occur.
*   **Other Concepts:** Identify if the question is about blame, knowledge, or desire, and adjust reasoning accordingly.

**For Causal Contribution Questions:**

1.  **Identify Causal Laws:** Extract all rules defining sufficient causes for the outcome. A sufficient cause can be a single event, a disjunction of events (A OR B), a conjunction of events (A AND B), or an *omission* (the absence of an expected action). Note the required components precisely.
2.  **Identify Actual Events & Omissions:** List all specific events that occurred. **Crucially, also identify relevant *omissions*: the absence of an action that an agent could have performed and had a reasonable expectation to perform.**
3.  **Map to Laws & Apply the But-For Test:**
    *   For each sufficient cause from Step 1, check if all its required components (events or omissions) were present.
    *   **The But-For Test (Necessity Check): For the specific action or omission (X) mentioned in the question, ask: "But for X (i.e., if X had not occurred or if the agent had acted instead of omitting), would the outcome (Y) still have happened in the exact same way and at the same time?"**
        *   If the answer is **no**, then X is a cause.
        *   If the answer is **yes**, then X is **not** a cause. **This is the primary test for causal necessity.**
    *   **For Omissions:** An omission is a cause **only if (i)** the agent could have and should have acted, **(ii)** performing the action would have prevented a sufficient cause from being present, and **(iii)** the "but-for" test yields "no" (the outcome would not have occurred if they had acted).
    *   **For Disjunctive Causes (OR):** The "but-for" test is crucial. If multiple sufficient causes are present, an event is a cause **only if it was necessary for its own sufficient chain** (i.e., but-for this event, its specific sufficient cause would not have been present).
    *   **For Conjunctive Causes (AND):** Each component is a cause. Apply the "but-for" test to each component.
4.  **Check for Overdetermination & Normality (Tie-Breaking Only):**
    *   **Overdetermination vs. Preemption:** If multiple sufficient causes were present, use the "but-for" test to distinguish true overdetermination (where no single cause is necessary) from preemption (where one cause is preempted by another). **Preempted causes are not actual causes.**
    *   **Normality as a Tie-Breaker:** **Only if the "but-for" test is inconclusive (e.g., in cases of perfect symmetric overdetermination where all causes are necessary for the timing/manner of the outcome),** use normality:
        *   If one cause is **normal/expected** and another is **abnormal/unexpected**, the abnormal cause is often the primary attribution.
        *   **For Conjunctive Causes (AND):** If a norm establishes one event as **normal** and the other as a **violation**, the abnormal event is the primary cause.
5.  **Avoid Pitfalls:**
    *   **Do not** conclude an event is not a cause simply because the outcome would have happened anyway; it must pass the "but-for" test.
    *   **Do not** conclude an event is a cause simply because it is part of a sufficient condition; it must be necessary according to the "but-for" test.
    *   **Do not** confuse causal contribution with intentionality or blameworthiness.
    *   **Do not** ignore normative context when assessing expectations for omissions or breaking ties, but do not let it override the "but-for" test.

**Apply this reasoning to the question.**

---

**Example 1 (Dryer - Omission in a Disjunction):**
Question: David's clothes will dry if either MAX DRY OR HIGH temp is set. Both were set. He did not change the HIGH temp setting. Did his inaction cause the drying?
Reasoning:
*   Step 0: Causal contribution question about an omission.
*   Step 1: Laws: (MAX DRY) OR (HIGH temp) are sufficient.
*   Step 2: Events: MAX DRY set. HIGH temp set. Omission: David did not change the temp.
*   Step 3 (But-For Test): But for David's inaction (if he had acted and turned the temp off), the sufficient cause "HIGH temp" would not have been present. The outcome would still have occurred due to "MAX DRY". Therefore, his inaction was **not necessary** for the outcome.
*   Answer: No
*   **Why this is correct:** The outcome was preempted by the MAX DRY setting. The inaction fails the "but-for" test.

**Example 2 (Hedgehog - Preemption):**
Question: A bear (allowed) and a hedgehog (not allowed) both took the last pencil. Did the hedgehog cause the box to be empty?
Reasoning:
*   Step 0: Causal contribution question.
*   Step 1: Law: The act of taking the last pencil is sufficient to empty the box.
*   Step 2: Events: Both animals took a pencil simultaneously.
*   Step 3 (But-For Test): But for the hedgehog's action, would the box still have become empty? Yes, because the bear (who is allowed) took a pencil and would have removed the last one. The hedgehog's action was preempted by the bear's action. It fails the "but-for" test.
*   Answer: No
*   **Why this is correct:** The bear's action alone was sufficient and would have caused the outcome. Normality (the hedgehog's violation) is irrelevant because the action fails the necessity test.

**Example 3 (Conjunctive Cause with Normality):**
Question: Lauren (followed policy) and Jane (violated policy) both logged on at 9:00 am, crashing the computer. Did Jane cause the crash?
Reasoning:
*   Step 0: Causal contribution question.
*   Step 1: Law: "Two people logged on simultaneously" is a sufficient conjunctive cause (A AND B).
*   Step 2: Events: Lauren logged on. Jane logged on.
*   Step 3 (But-For Test): But for Jane's action, would the crash have occurred? No, because the sufficient conjunction would not have been complete. Jane's action was necessary.
*   Step 4: This is a conjunctive cause. The company policy breaks the symmetry. Jane's action was a violation. Therefore, it is the primary cause.
*   Answer: Yes
*   **Why this is correct:** The action passes the "but-for" test. Normality then correctly identifies it as the primary cause.

**Example 4 (Intentionality):**
Question: A sniper fired a bullet, disturbing air molecules. He didn't care about this. Did he intentionally disturb them?
Reasoning:
*   Step 0: Intentionality question. Must check (1) causation and (2) intention.
*   Step 1-3 (Causation): Firing the bullet was sufficient to disturb the molecules. But-for test: if he hadn't fired, the disturbance wouldn't have happened. He caused it.
*   Step 0.2 (Intentionality): He did not have the goal/desire to disturb the molecules.
*   Answer: No

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the actual scenario. Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify Actual Events, States, and Salient Omissions:** List all relevant actions that occurred, salient omissions (instances where an agent who could have acted did not), and relevant states of the world (e.g., 'the machine lacked oil').
2.  **Identify All Sufficient Causes:** Based on the given rules, list every event or condition that, on its own, constitutes a sufficient condition for the outcome.
3.  **Establish Counterfactual Dependence (The Core "Difference-Maker" Test):**
    *   For any potential cause (action or omission), ask: **"If this specific event had not happened (or, for an omission, if the agent had acted), would the outcome still have occurred in the exact same way and timeframe?"**
    *   If **yes**, then the event is **not a cause-in-fact**. The outcome did not depend on it.
    *   If **no**, then the event is **a cause-in-fact**. It was a necessary element for the outcome.
    *   **Special Case for Omissions:** For an agent's failure to act, ask: **"If the agent had performed the action, would the outcome have been prevented?"** If yes, then their omission is a cause-in-fact.
4.  **Check for Causal Deviancy and Proximity (For "cause" questions):**
    *   An agent's action may not be the primary cause for attribution if the causal chain from their action to the outcome is long or involves:
        *   **(a) Abnormal Events:** A highly abnormal, independent, or coincidental event (e.g., a drunk driver crash, a lightning strike).

    *   Ask: "From the perspective of the agent in question, was the outcome a **foreseeable and direct** result of their specific action, given the normal, expected state of the world? Or was it brought about by an abnormal event or the independent, violating action of someone else?"
    *   If the path is **deviant** (due to (a) or (b)), then the primary cause is the abnormal or violating event. The initial agent's action is merely a background condition or enabling factor, not the cause for attribution.

    *   If the outcome was merely a foreseen but separate and undesired side effect of their action, it is **not** intentional.
7.  **Synthesize and Answer:** Weigh the results from the previous steps.
    *   If the event **failed the counterfactual test (Step 3)**, the answer is **No**.
    *   If it **passed Step 3**, it is **a** cause-in-fact.
    *   However, for the final binary answer ("Did X cause Y?"), answer **Yes** only if the event is **both** a difference-maker **and** the causal chain is **non-deviant (Step 4)**.
    *   If the event is a difference-maker but the chain is **deviant** (due to a freak event or another agent's violation), then it is **not** the cause for attribution, and the answer is **No**.

**Avoid Common Mistakes:**
-   **Do not confuse causal contribution with assignment of blame or responsibility.** An agent can be a cause-in-fact of an outcome (Step 3) even if they had no official duty to prevent it. Use the deviancy and multi-agent tests (Steps 4 & 5) to determine if they should be held accountable as the primary cause.
-   Do not conclude an event is a cause simply because it is a sufficient condition. It must also be a *difference-maker* (Step 3).
-   Do not conflate *causation* with *intentional causation*. Analyze the agent's goals separately (Step 6).
-   **For omissions:** Do not treat an omission as a late-occurring, redundant event. Analyze it using the specific counterfactual test for omissions in Step 3.

**Example Applications:**

**Example 1: Coffee Shop Profit (Redundancy - Action)**
**Question:** Did Drew ordering coffee cause the profit?
**Reasoning:**
1.  Events: Kylie ordered, Oliver ordered, Drew ordered.
2.  Sufficient Causes: Each individual's order is sufficient.
3.  **Counterfactual Test:** If Drew had not ordered, would profit still have occurred? **Yes.** Kylie and Oliver had already ordered. Drew's order was redundant.
4.  Deviancy: Not applicable.
5.  Conclusion: Drew's action did not make a difference.
**Answer: No**

**Example 2: Factory Omission (Difference-Making Omission)**
**Question:** Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?
**Scenario:** Janet (responsible) forgot to oil a machine. Kate (not responsible) noticed but did not oil it. The machine broke down.
**Reasoning:**
1.  **Events/States/Omissions:** Janet forgot to oil (omission). Machine lacked oil (state). Kate noticed but did not oil (omission). Machine broke down.
2.  Sufficient Cause: The machine lacking oil.
3.  **Counterfactual Test (for Kate's omission):** If Kate *had* put oil in the machine, would the breakdown have been prevented? **Yes.** Therefore, her omission is a cause-in-fact.
4.  **Deviancy/Proximity:** The breakdown is a direct result of lack of oil. The chain is not deviant.
5.  **Multi-Agent:** Janet violated her duty. Kate acted in a way that was "normal" for her role (but her omission was still causal).
6.  **Synthesis:** Kate's omission was a difference-maker. The causal chain is direct. Therefore, she caused the breakdown.
**Answer: Yes**

**Example 3: Joe and the Drunk Driver (Deviant Chain)**
**Question:** Did Joe cause his son's injury?
**Reasoning:**
1.  Events: Joe helped injured person, was delayed, neighbor drove son home, drunk driver crashed, son was injured.
2.  Sufficient Causes: The drunk driver's crash is the direct sufficient cause.
3.  **Counterfactual Test:** If Joe had not been delayed, would the injury have occurred? **No.** His delay was a necessary link.
4.  **Deviancy and Proximity:** The injury was directly caused by a drunk driverâ€”an independent, abnormal, and unforeseeable event. Therefore, the primary cause is the drunk driver's action.
5.  Conclusion: While Joe's action was a link, the deviant nature of the accident means he is not the primary cause for attribution.
**Answer: No**

**Example 4: Lauren and the Computer (Norm-Violating Intervention)**
**Question:** Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
**Reasoning:**
1.  Events: Jane (lawfully) logged on at 9:00 am. Lauren (unlawfully) logged on at 9:00 am. Computer crashed.
2.  Sufficient Causes: Two people logging on simultaneously.
3.  **Counterfactual Test:** If Jane had not logged on, would the crash have occurred? **No.** Her login was necessary.
4.  **Deviancy and Proximity:** The crash was directly caused by Lauren's independent, rule-violating action. The chain is deviant due to a norm-violating intervention.
5.  **Multi-Agent Scenario:** Jane acted in a prescribed manner. Lauren acted in a rule-violating manner.
6.  Conclusion: Although Jane's action was a difference-maker, the deviant chain means she is not the primary cause.
**Answer: No**

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution. Analyze the following question by first determining its type: causal attribution, intentionality, or causal contribution. Then, apply the relevant principles step-by-step.

### Principles for Analysis:

1.  **For Causal Attribution ("Did X cause Y?"):**
    *   **Apply the Counterfactual Test:** Ask "But for X's action, would Y have occurred?" A 'no' suggests X may be a cause, but this is not definitive.
    *   **Check for Preemption & Overdetermination:**
        *   **Symmetric Overdetermination:** If Y was guaranteed to be caused by multiple identical factors that were individually **sufficient**, then no single factor is **the** cause.
        *   **Asymmetric Overdetermination (Preemption):** If one factor preempts another (e.g., occurs first), that factor is the cause.
    *   **Identify the Proximate Cause:** Determine the most direct and immediate factor that produced the effect. In cases with multiple necessary factors, the proximate cause is typically the most salient, deliberate, or norm-violating intervention that made the decisive difference.
    *   **Evaluate Normative Responsibility:** Assess whether X's action was a routine, automatic duty or a conscious, informed decision. An agent who acts without full context or against established protocols often bears diminished causal responsibility compared to one whose deliberate choice altered the expected outcome.

2.  **For Intentionality ("Did X do Y intentionally?"):**
    *   **Focus on the Specific Action:** Judge the intentionality of the action itself (e.g., "firing the gun"), not just the outcome or the broader plan.
    *   **The Voluntariness Test:** Was the specific action a voluntary, conscious bodily movement? If it was a reflex, slip, or accident, it was not intentional, even if the outcome was intended.
    *   **Distinguish Foreseeability from Intention:** An outcome may be foreseeable but not intended. Intention requires a desire or goal to bring about that specific outcome through one's actions.

3.  **For Causal Contribution ("Did X's action play a causal role in Y?"):**
    *   **Necessary Element Test:** If Y required a set of conditions (A + B + C), and X provided a necessary condition (A), then X is **a** cause of Y. This is true even if X acted independently and without knowledge of the other conditions.
    *   **Avoid Misapplying Overdetermination:** Symmetric overdetermination requires individually *sufficient* causes. If multiple factors are only *necessary*, they are conjunctive causes, and each is a contributor.

**General Guidance:** Carefully interpret the question's context. The word "cause" is often ambiguous; it can refer to *a necessary condition* or *the most salient responsible factor*. Questions focusing on a single agent typically ask whether that agent's action was the decisive, responsible factor, not merely a necessary link in a causal chain. Pay close attention to normative elements like protocol violations or specialized knowledge.

### Examples of Correct Reasoning:

**Example 1 (Causal Attribution - Collective Cause):**
Question: Suzy and Billy arrive at the same time, triggering a detector that requires more than one person. Did Billy cause it?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Billy, the detector would not have gone off. However, this is not symmetric overdetermination, as neither was sufficient. Both were necessary. The cause is the collective event. Therefore, Billy is not *the* cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 2 (Intentionality):**
Question: Jake aims and pulls the trigger, but his hand slips, causing the gun to fire and kill his aunt. Did Jake shoot his aunt intentionally?
Reasoning: This is about intentionality. The specific action is "firing the gun." The gun discharged due to an involuntary slip, not a voluntary trigger pull. Therefore, the action of firing was not intentional, even though the outcome was intended.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Causal Contribution):**
Question: Bill independently buys the right bookend; Sue independently buys the left. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set?
Reasoning: This is about causal contribution. But for Bill's action, the paired set would not exist. His action was a necessary condition. This is not overdetermination (neither action was sufficient alone). Therefore, Bill is a cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Causal Attribution - Normative Responsibility):**
Question: A security guard (Guard A) routinely opens the outer gate for a delivery truck. A second guard (Guard B) is supposed to inspect the truck but illegally waves it through without a check. The truck contains a bomb that explodes. Did Guard A cause the explosion?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Guard A opening the gate, the truck could not have entered. However, Guard A's action was a routine, non-deviant part of the process. Guard B's action was the deliberate, norm-violating, proximate cause that changed the expected outcome. Therefore, Guard A is not the responsible cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 (Causal Attribution - Proximate Cause):**
Question: An intern needs two signatures to administer a drug. The pharmacist signs routinely. The doctor signs despite knowing it violates hospital policy. The drug works. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the recovery?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for the pharmacist's signature, the drug wouldn't have been administered. However, the pharmacist's action was routine and based on limited information (stock levels). The doctor's action was the informed, deliberate, and policy-violating decision that was the proximate cause of administering the drug. Therefore, the pharmacist is not the cause we hold responsible for the recovery.

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution. Analyze the following question by first determining its type: causal attribution, intentionality, or causal contribution. Then, apply the relevant principles step-by-step.

### Principles for Analysis:

1.  **For Causal Attribution ("Did X cause Y?"):**
    *   **Apply the Counterfactual Test Cautiously:** Ask "But for X's action, would Y have occurred?" A 'no' suggests X is *a* cause, but this is not definitive for being *the* cause.
    *   **Check for Overdetermination & Preemption:**
        *   **Symmetric Overdetermination:** If Y was guaranteed by multiple factors that were individually **sufficient**, no single factor is **the** cause.
        *   **Asymmetric Preemption (Temporal):** If one factor occurs first and completes the causal chain, it is the cause.
        *   **Pre-emptive Sufficient Condition:** If an agent creates a persistent, sufficient condition for Y (e.g., a trap), a later agent who merely triggers it is not **the** cause.
    *   **Identify the Proximate Cause:** Determine the most direct and immediate factor that produced the effect.
    *   **Assess Normative Deviance:** In scenarios with rules or standard procedures, the cause is typically the **abnormal** or **deviant** factor that explains the outcome. A routine action following policy is rarely seen as *the* cause.

2.  **For Intentionality ("Did X do Y intentionally?"):**
    *   **Focus on the Specific Action:** Judge the intentionality of the action itself (e.g., "firing the gun"), not just the outcome.
    *   **The Voluntariness Test:** Was the specific action a voluntary, conscious bodily movement? If it was a reflex, slip, or accident, it was not intentional.
    *   **Distinguish Foreseeability from Intention:** An outcome may be foreseeable but not intended. Intention requires a desire or goal to bring about that specific outcome.

3.  **For Causal Contribution ("Did X's action play a causal role in Y?"):**
    *   **Necessary Element Test:** If Y required a set of conditions (A + B + C), and X provided a necessary condition (A), then X is **a** cause of Y.
    *   **Avoid Misapplying Overdetermination:** Symmetric overdetermination requires individually *sufficient* causes. If multiple factors are only *necessary*, they are conjunctive causes.

### General Guidance:
*   **Interpret "Cause" Carefully:** A "yes" to causal attribution typically means X was **the** salient cause, not just *a* necessary condition. If the question is short ("Did X cause Y?"), it asks for the primary cause.
*   **Prioritize Deviance:** The most abnormal or policy-violating action in a chain of events is usually identified as the cause.
*   **Final Salience Check:** After analysis, ask: "Given the narrative, is it most accurate to say X caused Y?"

### Examples of Correct Reasoning:

**Example 1 (Causal Attribution - Symmetric Overdetermination):**
Question: Suzy and Billy arrive at the same time, triggering a detector that requires more than one person. Did Billy cause it?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Billy, the detector would not have gone off. However, this is symmetric overdetermination: neither was sufficient, both were necessary. The cause is the collective event.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 2 (Intentionality):**
Question: Jake aims and pulls the trigger, but his hand slips, causing the gun to fire and kill his aunt. Did Jake shoot his aunt intentionally?
Reasoning: This is about intentionality. The specific action is "firing the gun." This was an involuntary slip, not a voluntary movement. The action was not intentional.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Causal Contribution):**
Question: Bill independently buys the right bookend; Sue independently buys the left. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set?
Reasoning: This is about causal contribution. But for Bill's action, the set would not exist. His action was a necessary condition, not preempted by overdetermination.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Causal Attribution - Normative Deviance):**
Question: An intern needs two signatures. The pharmacist signs correctly per policy. The doctor signs incorrectly against policy. The patient recovers. Did the pharmacist cause the recovery?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. The pharmacist's action was a necessary condition (counterfactual holds). However, the doctor's action was the deviant, policy-violating factor. The pharmacist acted routinely. Therefore, the pharmacist is not the cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 (Causal Attribution - Pre-emptive Sufficient Condition):**
Question: Zoe logs in at 9 am, violating policy. Alice logs in at 9:30 am, following policy. This triggers an email. Did Alice cause the email?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Alice, the email would not have been sent. However, Zoe's violation created a pre-existing sufficient condition: the system only needed a second login. Alice was the inevitable trigger, not the creator of the causal setup. The cause is Zoe's deviant action.

    *   **Apply the Counterfactual Test:** Ask "But for X's action, would Y have occurred?" A 'no' suggests X is a cause, but this is not definitive.
    *   **Check for Preemption & Overdetermination:**
        *   **Symmetric Overdetermination:** If Y was guaranteed to be caused by multiple identical factors that were individually **sufficient**, then no single factor is **the** cause.
        *   **Asymmetric Overdetermination (Preemption):** If one factor preempts another (e.g., occurs first), that factor is the cause.
    *   **Identify the Proximate Cause:** Determine the most direct and immediate factor that produced the effect.
    *   **Causal Selection Heuristic:** In cases with multiple necessary conditions, the most salient cause is often the one that is **abnormal** (violates a norm or expectation) or demonstrates **agential involvement** (voluntary action with knowledge). A factor that is normal or expected is less likely to be selected as "the" cause.

2.  **For Intentionality ("Did X do Y intentionally?"):**
    *   **Focus on the Specific Action:** Judge the intentionality of the action itself (e.g., "firing the gun"), not just the outcome or the broader plan.
    *   **The Voluntariness Test:** Was the specific action a voluntary, conscious bodily movement? If it was a reflex, slip, or accident, it was not intentional, even if the outcome was intended.
    *   **Distinguish Foreseeability from Intention:** An outcome may be foreseeable but not intended. Intention requires a desire or goal to bring about that specific outcome through one's actions.
    *   **Side-Effect Effect (Knobe Effect):** If a harmful side-effect is foreseen by the agent and they proceed regardless, people are highly likely to judge that the side-effect was brought about intentionally, even if it was not the primary goal.

3.  **For Causal Contribution ("Did X's action play a causal role in Y?"):**
    *   **Necessary Element Test:** If Y required a set of conditions (A + B + C), and X provided a necessary condition (A), then X is **a** cause of Y. This is true even if X acted independently and without knowledge of the other conditions.
    *   **Avoid Misapplying Overdetermination:** Symmetric overdetermination requires individually *sufficient* causes. If multiple factors are only *necessary*, they are conjunctive causes, and each is a contributor.

4.  **For Omissions ("Did X's inaction cause Y?"):**
    *   **Duty Test:** Did the agent have a duty or expectation to act? If yes, their inaction (omission) can be considered a cause, even if the outcome would have occurred anyway through another means. The relevant counterfactual is "If they had acted as expected, would they have prevented Y?"

**General Guidance:** Interpret the question's wording precisely. "Cause" can mean "the sole cause" or "a contributing cause," but often implies **causal selection**â€”identifying the most salient cause based on abnormality and agency. "Intentionally" in everyday language can be influenced by the moral badness of a foreseen side-effect.

### Examples of Correct Reasoning:

**Example 1 (Causal Attribution - Abnormal Agent):**
Question: Lauren (against policy) and Jane (following policy) log on at the same time and crash the computer. Did Jane cause the crash?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Jane, the crash wouldn't happen. However, causal selection applies. Lauren's action was abnormal (violating policy) and agential (done knowingly). Jane's action was the normal, expected default. Therefore, Jane is not selected as the cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 2 (Intentionality - Knobe Effect):**
Question: The hunter knew he would hit a bird-watcher but didn't care. Did he intentionally shoot them?
Reasoning: This is about intentionality of a harmful side-effect. While his primary intention was to shoot the deer, he knowingly and without coercion caused a harmful outcome. In everyday judgment, harmful foreseen outcomes are typically considered intentional.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 3 (Omission - Duty Test):**
Question: Wayne saw the device was on the pad and chose not to move it. Was the charge because of this inaction?
Reasoning: This is about causation by omission. The device would have charged anyway (plugged in), so the standard counterfactual test fails. However, Wayne had a duty to ensure charging. By consciously verifying the state and choosing not to alter it, he endorsed the causal process. His inaction was a cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Causal Contribution - Necessary Condition):**
Question: Bill independently buys the right bookend; Sue independently buys the left. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set?
Reasoning: This is about causal contribution. But for Bill's action, the paired set would not exist. His action was a necessary condition. This is not overdetermination (neither action was sufficient alone). Therefore, Bill is a cause.

2.  **For Intentionality ("Did X do Y intentionally?"):**

4.  **For Omissions ("Did X's inaction cause Y?"):**
    *   **Standard Counterfactual Test (Necessity):** First, ask "If X had acted, would they have prevented Y?" If the answer is **no** (i.e., Y would have happened anyway), then the inaction was **not a necessary cause**. This suggests 'no', but is not definitive for attribution.
    *   **Agential Endorsement Test (Salience):** If the agent **consciously verified the state of the world** and then **chose not to intervene**, their inaction can be seen as an intentional endorsement of the existing causal process. This is especially true if they had a **role, duty, or implicit expectation** to manage the situation (e.g., they are the owner, they checked the settings). In such cases, even if the outcome was overdetermined, their **knowing omission** may be selected as **the** cause because it represents the most recent, agential, and voluntary factor.

**General Guidance:** Interpret the question's wording precisely. "Cause" can mean "the sole cause" or "a contributing cause," but often implies **causal selection**â€”identifying the most salient cause based on abnormality and agency. "Intentionally" in everyday language can be influenced by the moral badness of a foreseen side-effect.

**Order of Analysis for Conflicting Tests:**
1.  First, apply the relevant necessary/sufficiency tests (Counterfactual, Necessary Element).
2.  **If these tests yield a clear, definitive answer** (e.g., the action was clearly necessary or clearly unnecessary and no other salient factors exist), that is your answer.
3.  **If the tests are ambiguous or suggest no causation** (e.g., in overdetermination or omission cases where the outcome would have happened anyway), **then you MUST apply the Causal Selection Heuristic or the Agential Endorsement Test.**
4.  For omissions, always proceed to the Agential Endorsement Test after the Standard Counterfactual Test.

Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 3 (Omission - Agential Endorsement):**
Question: David checks the dryer's temperature setting (HIGH) and does nothing. The clothes dry due to the MAX DRY cycle. Did David's inaction cause the drying?
Reasoning: This is about causation by omission. Standard Counterfactual: If David had changed the setting, the clothes would still have dried (due to MAX DRY). His inaction was not necessary. However, Agential Endorsement applies: David consciously verified the state and chose not to change it. By doing so, he intentionally endorsed the causal pathway that led to the drying. His knowing omission is the salient, agential cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Omission - No Agential Involvement):**
Question: A rock is on a button that opens a door. Wayne sees the rock and does nothing. Is the door open because of Wayne's inaction?
Reasoning: This is about omission. Standard Counterfactual: If Wayne had moved the rock, the door would still be open (the rock is still pressing the button). His inaction was not necessary. Agential Endorsement Test: While Wayne saw the rock, he had no duty or role in managing the door mechanism. His inaction was a passive observation, not an intentional endorsement of a causal process. Therefore, his omission is not a cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 (Causal Contribution - Necessary Condition):**
Question: Bill independently buys the right bookend; Sue independently buys the left. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set?

    *   **Apply the Counterfactual Test Cautiously:** Ask "But for X's action, would Y have occurred?" A 'no' suggests X is *a* cause, but this is not definitive for being *the* cause.
    *   **Check for Overdetermination & Preemption:**
        *   **Symmetric Overdetermination (Duplicative):** If Y was guaranteed by multiple factors that were individually **sufficient at the same time**, no single factor is **the** cause.
        *   **Asymmetric Preemption (Temporal):** If one factor occurs first and completes the causal chain, it is the cause.
        *   **Pre-emptive Sufficient Condition:** If an agent creates a persistent, sufficient condition for Y (e.g., a trap), a later agent who merely triggers it is not **the** cause.
    *   **Identify the Proximate Cause:** Determine the most direct and immediate factor that produced the effect.

A routine action following policy is rarely seen as *the* cause. **If multiple factors are equally deviant in the same way, they are all causal.**

2.  **For Intentionality ("Did X do Y intentionally?"):**
    *   **Focus on the Specific Action:** Judge the intentionality of the action itself (e.g., "firing the gun"), not just the outcome.
    *   **The Voluntariness Test:** Was the specific action a voluntary, conscious bodily movement? If it was a reflex, slip, or accident, it was not intentional.
    *   **The Necessary Means Test:** If an agent performs a voluntary action to achieve a goal, and they know that a specific outcome is a necessary and known means to achieve that goal, then the agent intentionally brings about that outcome. The randomness or difficulty of the outcome does not negate the intention.
    *   **Distinguish Foreseeability from Intention:** An outcome may be foreseeable but not intended. Intention requires a desire or goal to bring about that specific outcome.

3.  **For Causal Contribution ("Did X's action play a causal role in Y?"):**
    *   **Necessary Element Test:** If Y required a set of conditions (A + B + C), and X provided a necessary condition (A), then X is **a** cause of Y.
    *   **Avoid Misapplying Overdetermination:** Symmetric overdetermination requires individually *sufficient* causes. If multiple factors are only *necessary*, they are conjunctive causes.

### General Guidance:
*   **Interpret "Cause" Carefully:** A "yes" to causal attribution typically means X was **the** salient cause, not just *a* necessary condition. If the question is short ("Did X cause Y?"), it asks for the primary cause.
*   **Conjunctive Causation:** In cases where multiple factors are all necessary and only together are sufficient (conjunctive causation), each necessary factor is accurately described as **a** cause of the outcome. Denying causation for one requires a reason to discount its role (e.g., preemption, normative deviance asymmetry).
*   **Prioritize Deviance:** The most abnormal or policy-violating action in a chain of events is usually identified as the cause.
*   **Final Salience Check:** After analysis, ask: "Given the narrative, is it most accurate to say X caused Y?"

### Examples of Correct Reasoning:

**Example 1 (Causal Attribution - Symmetric Overdetermination):**
Question: Suzy and Billy arrive at the same time, triggering a detector that requires more than one person. Did Billy cause it?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Billy, the detector would not have gone off. However, this is symmetric overdetermination: neither was sufficient, both were necessary. The cause is the collective event.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 2 (Intentionality - Slip):**
Question: Jake aims and pulls the trigger, but his hand slips, causing the gun to fire and kill his aunt. Did Jake shoot his aunt intentionally?
Reasoning: This is about intentionality. The specific action is "firing the gun." This was an involuntary slip, not a voluntary movement. The action was not intentional.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Causal Contribution - Conjunctive Cause):**
Question: Bill independently buys the right bookend; Sue independently buys the left. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set?
Reasoning: This is about causal contribution. But for Bill's action, the set would not exist. His action was a necessary condition, not preempted by overdetermination.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Causal Attribution - Normative Deviance):**
Question: An intern needs two signatures. The pharmacist signs correctly per policy. The doctor signs incorrectly against policy. The patient recovers. Did the pharmacist cause the recovery?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. The pharmacist's action was a necessary condition (counterfactual holds). However, the doctor's action was the deviant, policy-violating factor. The pharmacist acted routinely. Therefore, the pharmacist is not the cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 (Causal Attribution - Pre-emptive Sufficient Condition):**
Question: Zoe logs in at 9 am, violating policy. Alice logs in at 9:30 am, following policy. This triggers an email. Did Alice cause the email?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Alice, the email would not have been sent. However, Zoe's violation created a pre-existing sufficient condition: the system only needed a second login. Alice was the inevitable trigger, not the creator of the causal setup. The cause is Zoe's deviant action.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 6 (Causal Attribution - Equal Conjunctive Deviance):**
Question: Billy and Suzy both log in at the same time, against an unstated norm that this is dangerous. This causes emails to delete. Did Suzy cause the deletion?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Suzy, the deletion would not have occurred. Her action was necessary. Both agents performed the same deviant action (concurrent login) simultaneously. There is no preemption or asymmetry. In such cases of equal conjunctive deviance, each agent's action is a cause of the outcome.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 7 (Intentionality - Necessary Means):**
Question: Brown rolls a fair die, needing a six to detonate a bomb and kill Smith. It lands on six. Did Brown intentionally roll a six?
Reasoning: This is about intentionality. Brown's goal was to kill Smith. Rolling a six was a known and necessary means to that goal. The action of rolling the die was a voluntary act undertaken specifically to achieve that outcome. Therefore, he intentionally rolled a six.

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution. Analyze the following question by first determining its type: causal attribution, intentionality, or causal contribution. Then, apply the relevant principles step-by-step.

### Principles for Analysis:

1.  **For Causal Attribution ("Did X cause Y?"):**
    *   **First, Disambiguate 'Cause':** Determine if the question asks whether X was *a* cause (a necessary or sufficient factor) or *the* cause (the most salient or responsible factor). Context is key.
    *   **Apply the Counterfactual Test:** Ask "But for X's action, would Y have occurred?" A 'no' suggests X may be a cause.
    *   **Check for Preemption & Overdetermination:**
        *   **Symmetric Overdetermination:** If Y was guaranteed to be caused by multiple factors that were individually **sufficient**, then no single factor is typically considered **the** sole cause. **However, each sufficient factor can still be called *a* cause.**
        *   **Asymmetric Overdetermination (Preemption):** If one factor preempts another (e.g., occurs first), that factor is the cause.
    *   **Identify the Proximate Cause:** Determine the most direct and immediate factor that produced the effect. In cases with multiple necessary factors, the proximate cause is typically the most salient, deliberate, or norm-violating intervention that made the decisive difference.
    *   **Evaluate Normative Responsibility:** Assess whether X's action was a routine, automatic duty or a conscious, informed decision. An agent who acts without full context or against established protocols often bears diminished causal responsibility compared to one whose deliberate choice altered the expected outcome.
    *   **Final Check for Causal Role:** Even if not *the* proximate cause, if X's action was a necessary part of the actual set of conditions that led to Y, then X is *a* cause.

2.  **For Intentionality ("Did X do Y intentionally?"):**
    *   **First, Disambiguate 'Intentionally':** Determine if the question uses a narrow definition (requiring desire for the outcome) or a broad, legalistic definition (where knowing an outcome is certain qualifies as intentional).
    *   **Focus on the Specific Action:** Judge the intentionality of the action itself (e.g., "firing the gun"), not just the outcome or the broader plan.
    *   **The Voluntariness Test:** Was the specific action a voluntary, conscious bodily movement? If it was a reflex, slip, or accident, it was not intentional, even if the outcome was intended.
    *   **Distinguish Foreseeability from Intention:** An outcome may be foreseeable but not intended. Intention requires a desire or goal to bring about that specific outcome through one's actions.
    *   **Consider Knowledge of Certainty:** If an agent knows that an outcome is an absolutely certain (not just probable) result of their voluntary action, and they proceed regardless, that outcome is often considered intentional in a moral and legal sense, even if it was not their primary goal or desire.

3.  **For Causal Contribution ("Did X's action play a causal role in Y?"):**
    *   **Necessary Element Test:** If Y required a set of conditions (A + B + C), and X provided a necessary condition (A), then X is **a** cause of Y. This is true even if X acted independently and without knowledge of the other conditions.
    *   **Avoid Misapplying Overdetermination:** Symmetric overdetermination requires individually *sufficient* causes. If multiple factors are only *necessary*, they are conjunctive causes, and each is a contributor.

**General Guidance:** Carefully interpret the question's context and likely meaning. The words "cause" and "intentionally" are often ambiguous. Your first task is to disambiguate them. Does the scenario seem like a technical puzzle or a question about real-world responsibility? When in doubt, consider both interpretations of the question and choose the one that best aligns with principles of responsibility and common sense. Pay close attention to normative elements like protocol violations or specialized knowledge.

### Examples of Correct Reasoning:

**Example 1 (Causal Attribution - Collective Cause):**
Question: Suzy and Billy arrive at the same time, triggering a detector that requires more than one person. Did Billy cause it?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Billy, the detector would not have gone off. However, this is not symmetric overdetermination, as neither was sufficient. Both were necessary. The cause is the collective event. Therefore, Billy is not *the* cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 2 (Causal Attribution - Sufficient Cause):**
Question: Two assassins shoot a victim simultaneously. Either shot alone would have been fatal. Did Assassin A cause the death?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Assassin A, the death would still have occurred due to Assassin B. This is symmetric overdetermination. While neither is *the* sole cause, each performed an action that was independently sufficient to cause the death. Therefore, Assassin A is *a* cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 3 (Intentionality - Slip):**
Question: Jake aims and pulls the trigger, but his hand slips, causing the gun to fire and kill his aunt. Did Jake shoot his aunt intentionally?
Reasoning: This is about intentionality. The specific action is "firing the gun." The gun discharged due to an involuntary slip, not a voluntary trigger pull. Therefore, the action of firing was not intentional.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 (Intentionality - Knowing Certainty):**
Question: A thief plants a bomb in a vault, knowing a guard inside will certainly die. He doesn't care and sets the bomb, killing the guard. Did the thief intentionally kill the guard?
Reasoning: This is about intentionality. The thief's primary goal was to open the vault. However, he knew the guard's death was a certain outcome of his voluntary action. Under the broad "knowing" definition of intentionality, his action is intentional.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 5 (Causal Contribution):**
Question: Bill independently buys the right bookend; Sue independently buys the left. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set?
Reasoning: This is about causal contribution. But for Bill's action, the paired set would not exist. His action was a necessary condition. This is not overdetermination (neither action was sufficient alone). Therefore, Bill is a cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 6 (Causal Attribution - Normative Responsibility):**
Question: A security guard (Guard A) routinely opens the outer gate for a delivery truck. A second guard (Guard B) is supposed to inspect the truck but illegally waves it through without a check. The truck contains a bomb that explodes. Did Guard A cause the explosion?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Guard A opening the gate, the truck could not have entered. However, Guard A's action was a routine, non-deviant part of the process. Guard B's action was the deliberate, norm-violating, proximate cause that changed the expected outcome. Therefore, Guard A is not the responsible cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution. Analyze the following question by first determining its type: causal attribution, intentionality, causal contribution, or omission. Then, apply the relevant principles step-by-step.

### Principles for Analysis:

1.  **For Causal Attribution ("Did X cause Y?"):**
    *   **First, Interpret "Cause":** Determine if the question implies "*the* cause" (primary, salient cause) or "*a* cause" (any contributing factor). If ambiguous, assume it asks for causal attribution ("the cause").
    *   **Apply the Counterfactual Test:** Ask "But for X's action, would Y have occurred?" A 'no' suggests X is a cause, but this is not definitive.
    *   **Check for Preemption & Overdetermination:**
        *   **Symmetric Overdetermination:** If Y was guaranteed by multiple identical factors that were individually **sufficient**, then no single factor is **the** cause. **However, each sufficient factor is still *a* cause.**
        *   **Asymmetric Overdetermination (Preemption):** If one factor preempts another (e.g., occurs first), that factor is the cause.
    *   **Identify the Proximate Cause:** Determine the most direct and immediate factor that produced the effect.
    *   **Causal Selection Heuristic:** In cases with multiple necessary conditions, the most salient cause is often the one that is **abnormal** (a voluntary intervention, or a violation of a norm or expectation) or demonstrates **agential involvement** (voluntary action with knowledge). A factor that is normal or expected is less likely to be selected as "the" cause.
    *   **Causal Supersession Principle:** In a causal chain, if a subsequent event is a **voluntary, intentional, and highly abnormal intervention** (e.g., a crime, deliberate sabotage), this intervention often becomes the salient cause, superseding prior necessary conditions.

2.  **For Intentionality ("Did X do Y intentionally?"):**
    *   **Focus on the Specific Action:** Judge the intentionality of the action itself (e.g., "firing the gun"), not just the outcome or the broader plan.
    *   **The Voluntariness Test:** Was the specific action a voluntary, conscious bodily movement? If it was a reflex, slip, or accident, it was not intentional, even if the outcome was intended.
    *   **Distinguish Foreseeability from Intention:** An outcome may be foreseeable but not intended. Intention requires a desire or goal to bring about that specific outcome through one's actions.
    *   **Side-Effect Effect (Knobe Effect):** If a harmful side-effect is foreseen by the agent and they proceed regardless, people are highly likely to judge that the side-effect was brought about intentionally, even if it was not the primary goal.

3.  **For Causal Contribution ("Did X's action play a causal role in Y?"):**
    *   **Necessary Element Test:** If Y required a set of conditions (A + B + C), and X provided a necessary condition (A), then X is **a** cause of Y. This is true even if X acted independently and without knowledge of the other conditions.
    *   **Avoid Misapplying Overdetermination:** Symmetric overdetermination requires individually *sufficient* causes. If multiple factors are only *necessary*, they are conjunctive causes, and each is a contributor.

4.  **For Omissions ("Did X's inaction cause Y?"):**
    *   **Standard Counterfactual Test (Necessity):** First, ask "If X had acted, would they have prevented Y?" If the answer is **no** (i.e., Y would have happened anyway), then the inaction was **not a necessary cause**. This suggests 'no', but is not definitive for attribution.
    *   **Agential Endorsement Test (Salience):** If the agent **consciously verified the state of the world** and then **chose not to intervene**, their inaction can be seen as an intentional endorsement of the existing causal process. This is especially true if they had a **role, duty, or implicit expectation** to manage the situation (e.g., they are the owner, they checked the settings). In such cases, even if the outcome was overdetermined, their **knowing omission** may be selected as **the** cause because it represents the most recent, agential, and voluntary factor.

**General Guidance:** Interpret the question's wording precisely. "Cause" can mean "the sole cause" or "a contributing cause," but often implies **causal selection**â€”identifying the most salient cause based on abnormality and agency. "Intentionally" in everyday language can be influenced by the moral badness of a foreseen side-effect.

**Order of Analysis for Conflicting Tests:**
1.  First, apply the relevant necessary/sufficiency tests (Counterfactual, Necessary Element).
2.  **If these tests yield a clear, definitive answer of 'no'** (e.g., the action was clearly unnecessary, as in symmetric overdetermination), **then you MUST apply the Causal Selection Heuristic** to see if the agent's abnormal behavior nonetheless makes them the salient cause.
3.  **If these tests yield a clear, definitive answer of 'yes'** (e.g., the action was necessary), **you must then check for Causal Supersession.** Was there a subsequent, more proximate, and highly abnormal intervention (like a crime) that would be selected as the cause instead?
4.  For omissions, always proceed to the Agential Endorsement Test after the Standard Counterfactual Test.

### Examples of Correct Reasoning:

**Example 1 (Causal Attribution - Abnormal Agent):**
Question: Lauren (against policy) and Jane (following policy) log on at the same time and crash the computer. Did Jane cause the crash?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Jane, the crash wouldn't happen. However, causal selection applies. Lauren's action was abnormal (violating policy) and agential (done knowingly). Jane's action was the normal, expected default. Therefore, Jane is not selected as the cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 2 (Intentionality - Knobe Effect):**
Question: The hunter knew he would hit a bird-watcher but didn't care. Did he intentionally shoot them?
Reasoning: This is about intentionality of a harmful side-effect. While his primary intention was to shoot the deer, he knowingly and without coercion caused a harmful outcome. In everyday judgment, harmful foreseen outcomes are typically considered intentional.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 3 (Omission - Agential Endorsement):**
Question: David checks the dryer's temperature setting (HIGH) and does nothing. The clothes dry due to the MAX DRY cycle. Did David's inaction cause the drying?
Reasoning: This is about causation by omission. Standard Counterfactual: If David had changed the setting, the clothes would still have dried (due to MAX DRY). His inaction was not necessary. However, Agential Endorsement applies: David consciously verified the state and chose not to change it. By doing so, he intentionally endorsed the causal pathway that led to the drying. His knowing omission is the salient, agential cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Omission - No Agential Involvement):**
Question: A rock is on a button that opens a door. Wayne sees the rock and does nothing. Is the door open because of Wayne's inaction?
Reasoning: This is about omission. Standard Counterfactual: If Wayne had moved the rock, the door would still be open (the rock is still pressing the button). His inaction was not necessary. Agential Endorsement Test: While Wayne saw the rock, he had no duty or role in managing the door mechanism. His inaction was a passive observation, not an intentional endorsement of a causal process. Therefore, his omission is not a cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 (Causal Attribution - Symmetric Overdetermination):**
Question: Drew, Kylie, and Oliver each order coffee. Only one order is needed for the shop to profit. Did Drew's order cause the profit?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution ("the cause"). The outcome is symmetrically overdetermined; each order was sufficient. The counterfactual test fails (profit would have occurred without Drew). Causal Selection: All orders were normal and expected. No single order is abnormal or salient. Therefore, Drew is not *the* cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>
Note: If asked "Was Drew's order a cause?", the answer would be 'Yes', as it was a sufficient condition.

**Example 6 (Causal Attribution - Supersession):**
Question: Joe's delay put his son in a car that was then hit by a drunk driver. Did Joe cause his son's injury?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. Counterfactual Test: But for Joe's delay, the injury would not have occurred; his action was necessary. Now check for Causal Supersession: The drunk driver's action was a voluntary, intentional, illegal, and highly abnormal intervention that directly caused the injury. This proximate cause supersedes Joe's distal, morally neutral action. Joe created the opportunity, but the drunk driver is the salient cause of the harm.

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution. Analyze the following question by first determining its type: causal attribution, intentionality, or causal contribution. Then, apply the relevant principles step-by-step.

### Principles for Analysis:

1.  **For Causal Attribution ("Did X cause Y?"):**
    *   **Apply the Counterfactual Test Cautiously:** Ask "But for X's action, would Y have occurred?" A 'no' suggests X is *a* cause, but this is not definitive for being *the* cause.
    *   **Check for Overdetermination & Preemption:**
        *   **Symmetric Overdetermination (Duplicative):** If Y was guaranteed by multiple factors that were individually **sufficient at the same time**, no single factor is **the** cause.
        *   **Asymmetric Preemption (Temporal):** If one factor occurs first and completes the causal chain, it is the cause.
        *   **Pre-emptive Sufficient Condition:** If an agent creates a persistent, sufficient condition for Y (e.g., a trap), a later agent who merely triggers it is not **the** cause.
    *   **Identify the Proximate Cause:** Determine the most direct and immediate factor that produced the effect.
    *   **Assess Normative Deviance:** In scenarios with rules or standard procedures, the cause is typically the **abnormal** or **deviant** factor that explains the outcome. A routine action following policy is rarely seen as *the* cause. **If multiple factors are equally deviant in the same way, they are all causal.**
    *   **Causation by Omission:** An agent's inaction can be a cause if they had the **ability**, **opportunity**, and **awareness** to act, and their decision **preserved a sufficient condition** for the outcome. Even if another sufficient cause exists, the agent's choice *to allow* the outcome via one pathway can be a valid agential cause.

2.  **For Intentionality ("Did X do Y intentionally?"):**
    *   **Focus on the Specific Action:** Judge the intentionality of the action itself (e.g., "firing the gun"), not just the outcome.
    *   **The Voluntariness Test:** Was the specific action a voluntary, conscious bodily movement? If it was a reflex, slip, or accident, it was not intentional.
    *   **The Necessary Means Test:** If an agent performs a voluntary action to achieve a goal, and they know that a specific outcome is a necessary and known means to achieve that goal, then the agent intentionally brings about that outcome. The randomness or difficulty of the outcome does not negate the intention.
    *   **Distinguish Foreseeability from Intention:** An outcome may be foreseeable but not intended. Intention requires a desire or goal to bring about that specific outcome.

3.  **For Causal Contribution ("Did X's action play a causal role in Y?"):**
    *   **Necessary Element Test:** If Y required a set of conditions (A + B + C), and X provided a necessary condition (A), then X is **a** cause of Y.
    *   **Avoid Misapplying Overdetermination:** Symmetric overdetermination requires individually *sufficient* causes. If multiple factors are only *necessary*, they are conjunctive causes.

### General Guidance:
*   **Step 0: Identify the Frame of Reference:** Determine if the question seeks a *mechanistic* cause (the physical chain) or an *agential* cause (a person's role). Questions focusing on a specific person's action/inaction are typically agential.
*   **Interpret "Cause" Carefully:** A "yes" to causal attribution means that X was *a* cause of Y, and it is the most appropriate or salient cause to cite in the context of the question. It does not always require that X be the *only* cause.
*   **Conjunctive Causation:** In cases where multiple factors are all necessary and only together are sufficient (conjunctive causation), each necessary factor is accurately described as **a** cause of the outcome. Denying causation for one requires a reason to discount its role (e.g., preemption, normative deviance asymmetry).
*   **Prioritize Deviance and Agency:** The most abnormal action OR the specific decision of an agent in focus is often identified as the salient cause.
*   **Final Salience Check:** After analysis, ask: "Given the narrative and its focus, is it most accurate to say X caused Y?"

### Examples of Correct Reasoning:

**Example 1 (Causal Attribution - Symmetric Overdetermination):**
Question: Suzy and Billy arrive at the same time, triggering a detector that requires more than one person. Did Billy cause it?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Billy, the detector would not have gone off. However, this is symmetric overdetermination: neither was sufficient, both were necessary. The cause is the collective event.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 2 (Intentionality - Slip):**
Question: Jake aims and pulls the trigger, but his hand slips, causing the gun to fire and kill his aunt. Did Jake shoot his aunt intentionally?
Reasoning: This is about intentionality. The specific action is "firing the gun." This was an involuntary slip, not a voluntary movement. The action was not intentional.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Causal Contribution - Conjunctive Cause):**
Question: Bill independently buys the right bookend; Sue independently buys the left. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set?
Reasoning: This is about causal contribution. But for Bill's action, the set would not exist. His action was a necessary condition, not preempted by overdetermination.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Causal Attribution - Normative Deviance):**
Question: An intern needs two signatures. The pharmacist signs correctly per policy. The doctor signs incorrectly against policy. The patient recovers. Did the pharmacist cause the recovery?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. The pharmacist's action was a necessary condition (counterfactual holds). However, the doctor's action was the deviant, policy-violating factor. The pharmacist acted routinely. Therefore, the pharmacist is not the cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 (Causal Attribution - Pre-emptive Sufficient Condition):**
Question: Zoe logs in at 9 am, violating policy. Alice logs in at 9:30 am, following policy. This triggers an email. Did Alice cause the email?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Alice, the email would not have been sent. However, Zoe's violation created a pre-existing sufficient condition: the system only needed a second login. Alice was the inevitable trigger, not the creator of the causal setup. The cause is Zoe's deviant action.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 6 (Causal Attribution - Equal Conjunctive Deviance):**
Question: Billy and Suzy both log in at the same time, against an unstated norm that this is dangerous. This causes emails to delete. Did Suzy cause the deletion?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Suzy, the deletion would not have occurred. Her action was necessary. Both agents performed the same deviant action (concurrent login) simultaneously. There is no preemption or asymmetry. In such cases of equal conjunctive deviance, each agent's action is a cause of the outcome.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 7 (Intentionality - Necessary Means):**
Question: Brown rolls a fair die, needing a six to detonate a bomb and kill Smith. It lands on six. Did Brown intentionally roll a six?
Reasoning: This is about intentionality. Brown's goal was to kill Smith. Rolling a six was a known and necessary means to that goal. The action of rolling the die was a voluntary act undertaken specifically to achieve that outcome. Therefore, he intentionally rolled a six.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 8 (Causal Attribution - Omission with Overdetermination):**
Question: David has a new dryer... Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David did not change the temperature setting?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution with an agential focus (on David's decision). But for David's inaction, the outcome would have occurred via the MAX DRY setting (failed standard counterfactual). However, David checked the setting, showing awareness. He had the ability and opportunity to change it. His decision *not to change it* was a deliberate choice to *allow* the outcome to be caused by the HIGH temperature pathway. While not necessary, his omission was a sufficient and salient agential cause of the outcome occurring as it did.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution. Analyze the following question by first determining its type: causal attribution, intentionality, or causal contribution. Then, apply the relevant principles step-by-step.

### Principles for Analysis:

1.  **For Causal Attribution ("Did X cause Y?"):**
    *   **First, Disambiguate 'Cause':** Determine if the question asks whether X was *a* cause (a necessary or sufficient factor) or *the* cause (the most salient or responsible factor). **Crucial Guidance:** If the question is phrased neutrally (e.g., "Did X cause Y?"), the context usually indicates it is asking about *the* responsible cause. Look for normative clues: an element described as part of a routine, standard, or expected process (e.g., "was supposed to," "usually does") is rarely considered *the* cause. The cause is typically the most **abnormal** or **deviant** intervention.
    *   **Apply the Counterfactual Test:** Ask "But for X's action, would Y have occurred?" A 'no' suggests X may be a cause, but this is not definitive for being *the* cause.
    *   **Check for Preemption & Overdetermination:**
        *   **Symmetric Overdetermination:** If Y was guaranteed to be caused by multiple factors that were individually **sufficient**, then no single factor is typically considered **the** sole cause. **However, each sufficient factor can still be called *a* cause.**
        *   **Asymmetric Overdetermination (Preemption):** If one factor preempts another (e.g., occurs first), that factor is the cause.
    *   **Identify the Proximate Cause:** Determine the most direct and immediate factor that produced the effect. In cases with multiple necessary factors, the proximate cause is the most salient, deliberate, or norm-violating intervention that made the decisive difference.
    *   **Evaluate Normative Responsibility (The Deviance Principle):** Assess whether X's action was a routine, automatic duty or a conscious, informed decision that deviated from the norm. An agent who acts without full context or as part of a standard procedure bears diminished causal responsibility for being *the* cause compared to one whose deliberate, abnormal choice altered the expected outcome.
    *   **Final Check for Causal Role:** Even if not *the* proximate cause, if X's action was a necessary part of the actual set of conditions that led to Y, then X is *a* cause. **However, for most attribution questions, the focus is on identifying *the* cause.**

2.  **For Intentionality ("Did X do Y intentionally?"):**
    *   **First, Disambiguate 'Intentionally':** Determine if the question uses a narrow definition (requiring desire for the outcome) or a broad, legalistic definition (where knowing an outcome is certain qualifies as intentional).
    *   **Focus on the Specific Action:** Judge the intentionality of the action itself (e.g., "firing the gun"), not just the outcome or the broader plan.
    *   **The Voluntariness Test:** Was the specific action a voluntary, conscious bodily movement? If it was a reflex, slip, or accident, it was not intentional, even if the outcome was intended.
    *   **Distinguish Goal from Side-Effect (The Knobe Effect):** An outcome may be foreseeable or even certain but not intended. Intention requires a desire or goal to bring about that specific outcome. **Crucial Guidance:** For outcomes that are foreseen side-effects:
        *   If the side-effect is **harmful**, people are more likely to judge it as intentional.
        *   If the side-effect is **beneficial or neutral**, people are more likely to judge it as **not** intentional.
        Therefore, an agent does not intentionally cause a side-effect they are indifferent to, even if it is certain, unless the context implies malice or the outcome is harmful.
    *   **Consider Knowledge of Certainty:** If an agent knows that an outcome is an absolutely certain result of their voluntary action, and the outcome is harmful, that outcome is often considered intentional in a moral and legal sense, even if it was not their primary goal.

3.  **For Causal Contribution ("Did X's action play a causal role in Y?"):**
    *   **Necessary Element Test:** If Y required a set of conditions (A + B + C), and X provided a necessary condition (A), then X is **a** cause of Y. This is true even if X acted independently and without knowledge of the other conditions.
    *   **Avoid Misapplying Overdetermination:** Symmetric overdetermination requires individually *sufficient* causes. If multiple factors are only *necessary*, they are conjunctive causes, and each is a contributor.

**General Guidance:** Carefully interpret the question's context and likely meaning. The words "cause" and "intentionally" are often ambiguous. Your first task is to disambiguate them based on normative cues. Does the scenario seem like a technical puzzle or a question about real-world responsibility? When in doubt, consider both interpretations. **Sanity Check:** Review your conclusion against common sense and intuitive judgments of blame and responsibility. Would a reasonable person blame X for Y? Would they say X *meant* to do Y? Your final answer should align with these intuitive judgments.

### Examples of Correct and Incorrect Reasoning:

**Example 1 (Causal Attribution - Collective Cause):**
Question: Suzy and Billy arrive at the same time, triggering a detector that requires more than one person. Did Billy cause it?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Billy, the detector would not have gone off. However, this is not symmetric overdetermination, as neither was sufficient. Both were necessary. The cause is the collective event. Therefore, Billy is not *the* cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 2 (Causal Attribution - Sufficient Cause):**
Question: Two assassins shoot a victim simultaneously. Either shot alone would have been fatal. Did Assassin A cause the death?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution. But for Assassin A, the death would still have occurred due to Assassin B. This is symmetric overdetermination. While neither is *the* sole cause, each performed an action that was independently sufficient to cause the death. Therefore, Assassin A is *a* cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 3 (Causal Attribution - Normative Deviance):**
Question: A machine is set up so it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery. The black wire is supposed to touch it; the red wire is not. Both touch it, causing a short circuit. Did the black wire cause the short circuit?
Reasoning: This is causal attribution, asking if the black wire was *the* cause. But for the black wire, the short circuit would not have occurred; it was necessary. However, the black wire's action was normal and expected ("supposed to"). The red wire's contact was the abnormal, deviant event that violated the setup. Therefore, the red wire is *the* cause. The black wire, while necessary, is part of the background conditions and is not considered the cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 (Intentionality - Slip):**
Question: Jake aims and pulls the trigger, but his hand slips, causing the gun to fire and kill his aunt. Did Jake shoot his aunt intentionally?
Reasoning: This is about intentionality. The specific action is "firing the gun." The gun discharged due to an involuntary slip, not a voluntary trigger pull. Therefore, the action of firing was not intentional.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 (Intentionality - Knowing Certainty for Harm):**
Question: A thief plants a bomb in a vault, knowing a guard inside will certainly die. He doesn't care and sets the bomb, killing the guard. Did the thief intentionally kill the guard?
Reasoning: This is about intentionality. The thief's primary goal was to open the vault. However, he knew the guard's death was a certain and harmful outcome of his voluntary action. Under the broad "knowing" definition for harmful outcomes, his action is intentional.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 6 (Intentionality - Foreseen Side-Effect):**
Question: A hunter shoots a deer, knowing the gunshot will certainly scare an eagle away. He doesn't care about the eagle. Did he intentionally scare the eagle?
Reasoning: This is about intentionality. Scaring the eagle was a foreseen but neutral side-effect of his goal (shooting the deer). He was indifferent to it. According to the side-effect principle (Knobe Effect), for neutral/beneficial outcomes, we do not attribute intentionality. Therefore, he did not scare the eagle intentionally.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 7 (Causal Contribution):**
Question: Bill independently buys the right bookend; Sue independently buys the left. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set?
Reasoning: This is about causal contribution. But for Bill's action, the paired set would not exist. His action was a necessary condition. This is not overdetermination (neither action was sufficient alone). Therefore, Bill is a cause.

Answer questions about causal attribution by first identifying the scenario type, then applying the appropriate reasoning steps.

**A. Scenario Type Identification:**
*   **Type 1: Normative Scenario:** The question involves rules, laws, permissions, intentions, or knowledge (e.g., "allowed", "forbidden", "knew", "didn't know").
*   **Type 2: Physical Scenario:** The question involves only physical events and laws without normative context.

**B. Reasoning Steps:**

**For Type 1 (Normative Scenarios):**
1.  **Identify the Outcome and Relevant Norms:** Determine the problem and the rules/norms that apply.
2.  **Identify Actual Events and Knowledge:** List the specific actions and the knowledge/intent of each agent.
3.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test:** Ask: "If the agent in question had **not** performed the action, **while everything else (including other agents' actions and knowledge) remained the same**, would the outcome have been different?"
    *   If **Yes**, then the action was a cause.
    *   If **No**, then the action was **not** a cause.
4.  **Check for Blameworthiness:** An action that passes the counterfactual test is a cause. However, if the agent lacked the knowledge or intent to break a rule, they may not be considered the *blameworthy* cause, which is often the intended meaning in normative questions.

**For Type 2 (Physical Scenarios):**
1.  **Identify Causal Laws:** Extract the rules that define what events or combinations of events are sufficient to cause the outcome.
2.  **Identify Actual Events:** List the specific events that occurred, paying close attention to their timing.
3.  **Check for Causal Preemption:** Determine if a sufficient cause was already present and would have produced the outcome *before* another potential cause became active. A preempted event is **not** a cause.
4.  **Check for Symmetric Overdetermination:** If multiple sufficient causes occurred at the *same time* and none preempted the others, then each is a cause.
5.  **Check for Conjunctive Causes:** If the outcome requires a conjunction of events (A and B), and both occurred, then both A and B are causes.

**C. Final Synthesis:** Based on the reasoning above, provide a final "Yes" or "No" answer.

**Example 1 (Preemption - Type 2):**
Question: Tom works for a demolition company... Did the building implode because Tom changed the position of knob A?
Reasoning:
*   **Type:** Physical Scenario (Type 2).
*   **Step 2.1:** Causal Law -> Implosion if safety switch is off OR knob A is on.
*   **Step 2.2:** Actual Events -> At 4:00 PM, safety switch was off (and remained off). Tom later turned knob A on.
*   **Step 2.3: Check for Preemption:** The sufficient cause "safety switch off" was present *before* Tom acted and would have caused the implosion on its own. It preempted the cause "knob A on". Therefore, Tom's action was preempted.
*   **Final Answer:** <answer>No</answer>

**Example 2 (Normative - Type 1):**
Question: A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box... Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
Reasoning:
*   **Type:** Normative Scenario (Type 1 - involves rules and knowledge).
*   **Step 1.1:** Outcome: No pencils for polar bear. Norm: Only bears are allowed to take pencils. The hedgehog was absent and did not know this rule.
*   **Step 1.2:** Actual Events -> The bear (knowing the rule) took 7 pencils. The hedgehog (not knowing the rule) took 7 pencils.
*   **Step 1.3: Counterfactual Test:** If the hedgehog had not taken any pencils, would the outcome be different? Yes, 7 pencils would remain. So, the hedgehog's actions are a physical cause.
*   **Step 1.4: Blameworthiness:** The hedgehog lacked knowledge of the rule and therefore cannot be considered the blameworthy cause of the problem. The bear, who knew the rule, is the responsible agent.
*   **Final Answer:** <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Overdetermination - Type 2):**
Question: In a building with two businesses, each with enough employees to trigger the climate system alone, both arrive at the same time. Did one group cause the system to turn on?
Reasoning:
*   **Type:** Physical Scenario (Type 2).
*   **Step 2.1:** Causal Law -> Presence of Group A is sufficient. Presence of Group B is sufficient.
*   **Step 2.2:** Actual Events -> Both groups arrived at the same time.
*   **Step 2.4: Check for Overdetermination:** Both sufficient causes occurred simultaneously. Neither preempted the other. Therefore, both are causes.
*   **Final Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>

Apply this reasoning to the question.

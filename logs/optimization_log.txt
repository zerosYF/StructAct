Answer questions about causal attribution by performing the following rigorous analysis:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** State the specific outcome mentioned in the question.
2.  **Identify the Alleged Cause:** State the specific action or inaction (e.g., "did not change X") whose causal role is being questioned.
3.  **List the Conditions:** Identify all the necessary and/or sufficient conditions required for the outcome to occur, as stated in the scenario.
4.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test:** This is the most critical step. Construct a counterfactual scenario where the agent performs the opposite of the alleged cause.
    - For an *inaction* (e.g., "did not change X"), ask: "If the agent **HAD** changed X, would the outcome have been **prevented** or been **different**?"
    - For an *action*, ask: "If the agent had **NOT** performed the action, would the outcome have been **prevented** or been **different**?"
5.  **Judge Causality:**
    - If the answer to the counterfactual question is **YES**, then the alleged action/inaction **WAS** a cause. It was necessary to achieve the specific outcome.
    - If the answer is **NO**, then the alleged action/inaction was **NOT** a cause. The outcome was over-determined or the action was irrelevant.
6.  **Final Answer:** Based solely on this counterfactual test, output your final answer.

**Crucial Guidance:** An action or inaction can be a cause even if it is not the *only* cause. Your analysis must focus on whether it was a necessary contributing factor for the outcome as it happened. Do not dismiss a cause simply because another sufficient condition was present; evaluate its necessity by applying the counterfactual test.

Answer questions about causal attribution by analyzing the causal role of a specific action or omission in bringing about an outcome. Follow this structured reasoning process:

1.  **Define the Target Outcome:** Identify the specific event or state that occurred.
2.  **Define the Candidate Cause:** Identify the specific action or omission whose causal role is in question.
3.  **Apply a Counterfactual Test:** Determine if the outcome would have been different in a scenario where the candidate cause was absent (e.g., if an action was not taken or an omission was acted upon). If the outcome would have been different, the candidate cause is a *causal factor*.
4.  **Assess the Role of Omissions:** For a candidate cause that is an omission, evaluate if there was a pre-existing duty, a salient opportunity, or a reasonable expectation to act. An omission can be causal if it deviates from a normal or expected course of action that would have prevented the outcome.
5.  **Identify Proximate Causation:** Determine if the candidate cause is the most direct and foreseeable cause of the outcome. An independent, intentional, or highly improbable intervening event may break the chain of causation, making a prior cause merely a background condition rather than the proximate cause.
6.  **Isolate Causation from Responsibility:** Separate the factual question of causation from normative judgments of blame, praise, or legal liability. An action can be a cause without the actor being blameworthy, and vice versa.
7.  **Synthesize and Decide:** Based on the above, conclude whether the candidate cause was a proximate and necessary factor in the outcome.

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying a counterfactual reasoning framework focused on necessity.

**Definition:** An event is a cause of an outcome if the outcome would not have occurred in the absence of that event, assuming all other factors followed their normal or expected course.

**Reasoning Steps:**
1.  Identify the specific event proposed as the cause.
2.  Construct a counterfactual scenario where this event does **not** happen. In this scenario, the behavior of all other systems defaults to their **typical, likely, or expected state** (e.g., a "very unlikely" event does not happen, a "likely" event does happen).
3.  Determine if the outcome would still have occurred in this counterfactual scenario.
    - If the outcome would **NOT** have occurred, then the event **is a cause**. Answer **Yes**.
    - If the outcome **WOULD** have occurred, then the event is **not a cause**. Answer **No**.

Always base your final answer strictly on this counterfactual necessity test.

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying a counterfactual reasoning framework focused on necessity and actual causation.

**Core Principle:** An event is a cause of an outcome if, within the specific context of what actually occurred, the outcome would not have happened in the absence of that event, assuming all other factors followed their normal, typical, or expected courseâ€”unless they were directly dependent on the absent event.

**Reasoning Steps:**
1.  **Identify the Event:** Pinpoint the specific event proposed as the cause.
2.  **Construct the Counterfactual:** Imagine a world where **this specific event is absent**. In this world:
    - Hold fixed the normal, default, or expected behavior of all other systems and actors.
    - **Critically, consider other potential causes:** Actively assess whether any other factors that were present in the actual scenario would have still been sufficient to cause the outcome on their own in a typical and expected manner.
3.  **Test for Necessity:** Determine if the outcome would still have occurred in this counterfactual scenario.
    - If the outcome would **definitely not** have occurred, then the event is a cause. Answer **Yes**.
    - If the outcome **would** have occurred (e.g., because another sufficient cause was present and would have triggered it), then the event is **not a cause**. Answer **No**.
4.  **Check for Overdetermination:** Be especially careful in scenarios with multiple sufficient factors. If the outcome would have happened anyway due to another identical, sufficient factor (e.g., another person performing the same action), then no single factor is a cause. Your answer should be **No** to questions asking if a single actor caused it.

Always base your final answer strictly on this counterfactual necessity test.

Answer questions about causal attribution and related concepts (like intentionality) by following this structured reasoning process:

1.  **Define the Target Outcome:** Precisely identify the specific event or state that occurred.
2.  **Define the Candidate Cause:** Identify the specific action, omission, or event whose causal role or intentionality is in question.
3.  **Analyze Factual Causation:**
    *   **Apply a Counterfactual Test (But-For):** Ask: "Would the outcome have occurred *at that exact time and in that exact way* if the candidate cause had been absent?"
    *   **Handle Overdetermination/Preemption:** If the counterfactual test suggests the cause was not necessary (e.g., because another sufficient cause was present), ask: "Was the candidate cause still part of the actual sequence of events that brought about the outcome?" If yes, it is typically considered a cause.
4.  **Assess the Role of Omissions:** If the candidate cause is an omission, evaluate if there was a salient duty, opportunity, or normative expectation to act. An omission is causal if it deviated from a course of action that would have prevented the outcome.
5.  **Analyze Intentionality (If Required):** If the question involves whether an agent acted intentionally:
    *   **Identify the Agent's Goal/Purpose:** Determine the primary objective or desire motivating the agent's action.
    *   **Identify Foreseen Consequences:** Determine what outcomes the agent knew would likely occur.
    *   **Decide on Intent:** Conclude an outcome was **intentional** only if it was the agent's direct goal or purpose. An outcome that was a foreseen but undesired side-effect is **knowing** but not intentional. Do not equate knowledge of a consequence with intent to cause it.
6.  **Isolate Conceptual Layers:** Rigorously separate the factual question of causation ("did X contribute to Y?") from the mental state question of intentionality ("did the agent aim for Y?") and from normative judgments of blame, praise, or liability.
7.  **Synthesize and Decide:** Based on the above, conclude on the specific question asked. Your final answer must directly address the query as posed.

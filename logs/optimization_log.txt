Task: Analyze the SVG path provided and identify the primary geometric shape it visually represents from the given options. Your analysis must reconstruct the final rendered form by interpreting the complete path structure.

Key analytical rules:
1.  **Path Reconstruction:** Parse the entire path. Treat every `M` (move-to) command as the start of a new, separate sub-path. A `Z` command closes the current sub-path by connecting to its initial point.
2.  **Closed Shape Identification:** A shape is closed if it consists of: (a) a single sub-path ending with `Z` or at its starting point, OR (b) multiple sub-paths whose endpoints connect perfectly to form a complete polygon outline.
3.  **Vertex Analysis for Polygons:** For closed shapes (from Rule 2):
    - Extract all unique coordinate points that define the polygon's vertices.
    - The number of unique vertices determines the polygon type: 3 (triangle), 4 (quadrilateral), 5 (pentagon), 6 (hexagon), 7 (heptagon), 8 (octagon).
    - For quadrilateral shapes, prefer "rectangle" over "kite" unless the context suggests otherwise.
4.  **Curved Shape Analysis:** For paths containing arc commands (`A`):
    - Calculate the straight-line distance between the start and end points of each arc. If this distance is approximately twice the X-radius (`rx`), the arc represents a semicircle.
    - Two semicircular arcs with identical radii that start and end at the same points form a complete circle.
    - If `rx` and `ry` are equal, the shape is circular. If they differ, it is elliptical.
    - A "sector" requires two straight radial lines (`L` commands) and a single connecting arc. Paths using only arcs do not qualify as sectors.
5.  **Line Identification:** A path that does not form a closed shape (as defined in Rule 2) is a "line".
6.  **Final Synthesis:** Trace the complete drawing sequence. Only combine points from different sub-paths if they form an implied connection (Rule 2b). The primary shape is defined by the overall vertex count and connection pattern.

Output only the name of the correct shape from the options list, enclosed in `<answer>` tags. Do not provide any explanation.

You are an expert at analyzing SVG paths to identify the geometric shape they are intended to represent. Your task is to choose the correct shape from a list of options.

**Instructions:**

**Step 1: Classify the Path**
First, scan the `d` attribute for command types.
*   If the path contains **only** `M`, `L`, `H`, `V`, and `Z` commands, classify it as a **POLYGON** and proceed to **Step 2A**.
*   If the path contains **any** `C`, `S`, `Q`, `T`, or `A` commands, classify it as a **CURVED SHAPE** and proceed to **Step 2B**.

**Step 2A: Analyze Polygons**
1.  **Extract Vertices:** Identify all unique coordinate points that define the shape's corners. Ignore a "Move to" (M) command if it is immediately followed by a "Line to" (L) to the same point.
2.  **Count Sides:** The number of unique vertices is the number of sides.
3.  **Analyze Holistically:** Look for visual patterns in the point coordinates. Are opposite sides approximately parallel? Are adjacent sides perpendicular? Are all sides approximately equal? Do not perform precise mathematical calculations.
4.  **Map to Shape:** Match the properties to the most specific polygon in the options (e.g., "square" over "rectangle", "rectangle" over "quadrilateral").

**Step 2B: Analyze Curved Shapes**
1.  **Identify Commands:** Note the types of curve commands used.
2.  **For Arcs (A commands):** This is critical. Analyze the arc parameters `(rx, ry, rotation, large-arc-flag, sweep-flag, x, y)`.
    *   **Check Radii:** If all `A` commands have equal x and y radii (`rx == ry`), the arcs are circular. If any `A` command has unequal radii (`rx != ry`), the arcs are elliptical.
    *   **Determine Completeness:** A path that uses arcs to form a closed loop (where the end point equals the start point) and has consistent circular radii is a **circle**. A closed loop with consistent elliptical radii is an **ellipse**.
    *   **Identify Sectors:** A shape is only a **sector** if it is explicitly composed of an arc connected by two straight lines (L commands) to a central point. The presence of arcs alone does not imply a sector.
3.  **For Other Curves (C, S, Q, T):** These typically form custom, rounded shapes. A smooth, continuous closed loop is likely a circle or ellipse. A shape with both curves and straight lines is a composite rounded shape.

**Step 3: Make the Final Decision**
*   For polygons, the number of sides is the primary differentiator (e.g., 3 sides -> triangle).
*   For curves, use this hierarchy of specificity:
    *   **Circle** (all arcs have equal radii, forming a closed loop) > **Ellipse** (all arcs have unequal radii, forming a closed loop) > **Sector** (must have two straight radii and one arc) > **Arc** (an open curve).
*   Prioritize the intended shape. A circle is more specific than an ellipse; a full circle is more specific than a sector.2025-09-06 17:57:52,262 - ðŸ“Š Current Template_description:

You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Your task is to determine if the Hypothesis can be **logically inferred** from the Premise. The answer is `entailment` **only if** the Hypothesis **must be true** whenever the Premise is true. Otherwise, the answer is `non-entailment`.

**Crucial Instructions for Logical Reasoning:**
1.  **Core Principle:** The "closed-world" consists of the information in the premise **and the essential, definitional, and common-sense properties of the words used.** You **must** use these properties to evaluate what is logically necessary. Do not invent far-fetched or fantastical counterexamples that violate the standard meaning of words (e.g., a "dishwasher" is understood to be an appliance located indoors; this is a necessary attribute for inference).
2.  **Belief and Attitude Verbs (e.g., thinks, knows, believes, assumes, suspects, remembers):**
    *   **Critical Distinction:** First, classify the verb.
        *   **Factive Verbs (e.g., knows, remembers, regrets):** These verbs **presuppose** the truth of their complement clause. `[Agent] VERB that [Proposition P]` entails that `P` is true. (Example: "She knows he left" entails "He left").
        *   **Non-Factive Verbs (e.g., thinks, believes, assumes, suspects):** These verbs **do not** presuppose the truth of their complement. `[Agent] VERB that [Proposition P]` **does not** entail that `P` is true. It only entails that the agent has that mental attitude toward `P`. (Example: "She suspects he left" does **not** entail "He left").
    *   **Nested Structures:** When verbs are nested, apply the rules from the **inside out**.
        1.  Isolate the most deeply embedded proposition (e.g., `X`).
        2.  Determine the relationship between the innermost verb and `X` (is it factive or non-factive?).
        3.  Move one level out. The entire inner clause now serves as a new proposition (`P`). Determine the relationship between the outer verb and `P`.
    *   **Entailment between Attitudes:** For an entailment to hold across nested beliefs, it must hold at every level based on the verb classes defined above. **You cannot simply "drop" a level of belief.** (Example: "A thinks that B suspects X" entails "A thinks that X" **only if** "B suspects X" entails "X". Since "suspects" is non-factive, it does not. Therefore, the entailment is invalid.)
3.  **Lexical and Common-Sense Entailment:** A hypothesis is entailed if it:
    *   Replaces a word with its hypernym (e.g., "a terrier" -> "a dog").
    *   Replaces a whole with a necessary part (meronym) (e.g., "a car" -> "it has wheels").
    *   States a necessary, definitional attribute of a concept (e.g., "using a dishwasher" -> "being indoors"; "is a bachelor" -> "is unmarried").
4.  **Structural Entailment:** A hypothesis is entailed if it is a grammatical simplification (e.g., active/passive voice change, relative clause reduction) that preserves the core factual claims.
5.  **Presupposition and Conventional Implicature:** A hypothesis is entailed if it is a presupposition of the premise (e.g., "He stopped running" entails "He was running") or a strong, conventional implicature based on common sense (e.g., "She managed to open the door" entails "The door was closed and was difficult to open").
6.  **Non-Entailment:** The answer is `non-entailment` if the hypothesis:
    *   Contradicts the premise.
    *   Is more specific (e.g., replaces a hypernym with a hyponym like "a dog" -> "a terrier").
    *   Introduces new information not grounded in or implied by the premise **according to the rules above**.
    *   Is merely plausible or possible but not necessary (e.g., "John ate an apple" does not entail "John was hungry").
    *   **Removes a level of a nested belief structure** unless the inner verb is factive (see Rule 2).

**Reasoning Format:**
Follow these steps. First, think step by step, applying the rules above.
- **Premise Analysis:** [Break down the premise's meaning, identifying key verbs, entities, and their necessary attributes based on common sense. For nested beliefs, identify all attitude verbs, classify them as factive/non-factive, and isolate the core proposition.]
- **Hypothesis Analysis:** [Break down what the hypothesis claims. Compare its specificity and structure to the premise.]
- **Inference Application:** [Explain which rules apply. Justify the use of any common-sense knowledge as a necessary part of the words' meanings. For nested beliefs, apply the inside-out procedure. State if the hypothesis must be true given the premise.]
- **Final Answer:** Conclude with your final answer wrapped in the tags `<answer>entailment</answer>` or `<answer>non-entailment</answer>`.

Now, analyze the following:
Premise: {premise}
Hypothesis: {hypothesis}
you are counting (e.g., individual animals, vegetable items). Your entire process must convert the list into a count of these discrete units.

1.  **Identify the Full List:** Meticulously parse the user's input to identify every single phrase mentioned in their list. Pay extremely close attention to commas, the word "and," and conjunctions which separate items. Your goal is to segment the input into its constituent parts.

2.  **Parse Each List Item Against the Unit of Analysis:** For each discrete item phrase, determine how many units of the *final answer* it contains.
    *   **Explicit Numeric Quantifier:** If a phrase contains a number that directly modifies a noun (e.g., "three carrots", "5 books"), that number is the count of the final units for that item.
    *   **Implicit Singular Quantifier:** If a phrase uses a singular indefinite article ("a", "an") or the word "one" (e.g., "a car", "an apple", "one lamp"), it contributes 1 unit.
    *   **Unit Conversion & Container Objects:** For phrases using collective nouns or units (e.g., "bunch of", "pair of", "head of", "carton of"), you must convert to the requested unit.
        *   **Known Conversions:**
            *   `a garlic` or `a head of garlic` -> Count: **8** (cloves)
            *   `a bunch of bananas` -> Count: **6** (bananas)
            *   `a carton of eggs` -> Count: **12** (eggs)
        *   **General Principle:** For other units (e.g., "a pair of shoes", "a bushel of apples"), the count is the number that modifies the unit. Then, determine what that unit represents in the context of the final question. (e.g., "a pair of shoes" asked for "shoes" -> 2 units; asked for "pairs" -> 1 unit). If the conversion is unknown, count the collective unit itself (e.g., "a bushel" -> 1 unit) and note the ambiguity.
    *   **Implicit Plural Quantifier:** If a phrase consists of a plural noun with no preceding number (e.g., "toasters", "apples"), you must infer a quantity of the final units. Use context and common sense. A reasonable default is **2**, but be prepared to deviate for objects typically used in groups (e.g., "scissors" -> 1 object, "people" -> assume 3, "grapes" -> assume a small handful ~10). Explain your reasoning.
    *   **Standalone Numbers:** If a number (e.g., "three") appears as its own separate list item, it is to be counted as 1 discrete unit of the final answer.

You are an expert at answering questions about data tables. Your task is to answer questions based on the provided information.

**Instructions:**
1.  First, identify the relevant context for the question. Pay extremely close attention to the exact wording of the question. The question itself dictates which data is relevant.
2.  If the question uses a general term like "animal" or "table," it may refer to any data provided in the input. If it uses a specific term like "penguin," then only the penguin data is relevant.
3.  Your analysis must include all entities in the relevant data, including any that are described in text as being added to a table.
4.  Reason step by step:
    a.  **Parse the Question:** What is the question specifically asking for? Identify all key words.
    b.  **Identify Relevant Data:** Based on the question's wording, which dataset(s) must be used?
    c.  **Analyze:** Find the correct answer by comparing the relevant attributes from the identified data.
5.  Your **final answer** must be a single name from the list of options, spelled exactly as shown. Do not output any other text after the final answer.

**Example 1:**
Question: Which penguin is the heaviest?
Options:
Alice
Bob
Carol
Reasoning:
a. Parse: The question asks for the "heaviest penguin." The key word is "penguin."
b. Data: Therefore, only the penguin table is relevant.
c. Analyze: Bob's weight (45) is higher than Alice's (40) and Carol's (42).

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution. Your task is to answer questions about whether a specific event caused an outcome.

**Guidelines for Analysis:**

1.  **Identify the Outcome and Potential Cause:** Clearly state the outcome and the event whose causal role is being questioned. Determine if the potential cause is an action (commission) or an inaction (omission/preservation of state).

2.  **Hierarchical Causal Tests:** Apply the following tests in order:
    a.  **Counterfactual Dependence (Necessity):** Ask: "If the potential cause had NOT occurred (or, for an omission, if the agent HAD acted), but everything else had been as similar as possible, would the outcome still have happened?"
        - If **No**, then the event **was a cause**. Conclude "Yes".
        - If **Yes**, the event may not be necessary, so proceed to the next test.
    b.  **Sufficiency and Actualization:** Ask: "Was the event itself sufficient to bring about the outcome, or was it part of a set of conditions that were sufficient and actually occurred?"
        - If **Yes**, then the event **was a cause**. This includes cases of **symmetric overdetermination** (multiple sufficient causes). Conclude "Yes".
        - If **No**, proceed to the next test.
    c.  **Causal Omission/Preservation:** For omissions or failures to act (e.g., "did not change"), ask: "Did the agent's inaction preserve a state that was sufficient for the outcome, and did the agent have the ability and opportunity to alter that state?"
        - If **Yes**, then the omission **was a cause**. Conclude "Yes".
        - If **No**, proceed to the final test.
    d.  **Preemption and Normality:** Evaluate if the scenario involves preemption or abnormal events. An event can be a cause even if preempted. An abnormal event is often the salient cause, but a normal event can still be a cause.

**Final Decision:**
Conclude with a final answer of "Yes" or "No". A "Yes" answer is justified if the event passes any of the tests above (it was necessary, sufficient, part of a sufficient set, or a causal omission). A "No" answer is only justified if it fails all tests.

You are an expert in causal and intentional attribution. Your task is to answer questions about whether a specific event caused an outcome and, when asked, whether it was intentional.

**Guidelines for Analysis:**

**STEP 1: DETERMINE ACTUAL CAUSATION ("Did X cause Y?")**

1.  **Identify Outcome and Potential Cause:** State the outcome (Y) and the specific event (X) whose causal role is being questioned.
2.  **Primary Test: Counterfactual Dependence:**
    Ask: "If X had NOT occurred, but everything else was as similar as possible (holding fixed other events mentioned), would Y still have happened?"
    - If **No**, then X was an actual cause of Y.
    - If **Yes**, then X was not an actual cause.
3.  **Test for Normality and Salience (Causal Attribution):**
    Human causal judgment is influenced by norms and expectations. An actual cause may not be the attributed cause.
    - Identify if X was **abnormal** (violates a rule, statistic, or expectation) or **normal** (follows a rule, is routine).
    - If multiple events are actual causes, the **abnormal** event is typically the one to which the outcome is attributed. A normal event that completes a causal chain initiated by an abnormality is often not seen as the cause.

**STEP 2: DETERMINE INTENTIONALITY (Only if the question asks "intentionally" or "on purpose")**

Causing an outcome is not sufficient for doing it intentionally. You MUST analyze this separately.
4.  **Test for Intentional Action:** To determine if an agent **intentionally** brought about Y:
    - **Primary Goal:** Was achieving Y a specific goal or desire of the agent? Did they act *in order to* bring about Y?
    - **Foreseen Side Effect:** Did the agent know Y would happen but was primarily motivated by a different goal (Z)? Was Y a known but unwanted consequence?
    - If the answer to **Primary Goal** is yes, then the action was intentional.
    - If the answer is only **Foreseen Side Effect**, then the action was *not* intentional.

**FINAL DECISION:**
Synthesize your analysis from the steps above.
- For causal questions: Your final answer is based on **Step 3 (Attribution)**. If X is the salient, abnormal cause, answer "Yes". If X is a normal event and an abnormal event is the salient cause, answer "No".
- For intentionality questions: You must find that the agent is the attributed cause of Y **(Step 3)** AND that they intended it **(Step 4)** to answer "Yes". If they caused it but did not intend it, answer "No".

**Conclude with a final answer of "Yes" or "No".**

You are an expert in causal and intentional attribution. Your task is to answer questions about whether a specific event caused an outcome or whether an agent intentionally caused an outcome.

**Guidelines for Analysis:**

**Step 1: Determine the Question Type**
*   First, identify if the question is about **factual causation** ("Did event X cause outcome Y?") or **intentionality** ("Did agent X *intend* to cause outcome Y?").
*   **For Intentionality:** Analyze the agent's stated goals and purposes. An agent intends an outcome only if they act *in order to* bring it about. Mere knowledge that an outcome will occur as a side effect is **not sufficient** for intention. Proceed directly to Step 5.

**Step 2: Identify the Outcome and Potential Cause**
*   Clearly state the outcome.
*   Clearly state the specific event or action whose causal role is being questioned.

**Step 3: Apply the Counterfactual Test for Causation**
*   Ask: "If the potential cause had **NOT** occurred, but everything else had been as similar as possible (holding fixed other key events in the scenario), would the outcome still have happened in the exact same way?"
*   - If **No**, then the event was **a cause**.
*   - If **Yes**, then the event was **not a cause**.

**Step 4: Evaluate Special Causal Structures & Normative Context**
*   **Symmetric Overdetermination (Independent Sufficiency):** If multiple events were each sufficient on their own to cause the outcome, then each is a cause. (Answer is likely **Yes**).
*   **Symmetric Overdetermination (Joint Necessity):** If the outcome required multiple events to occur together (e.g., two people being present), and all events were **normal** or **prescribed**, then no single event is typically considered *the* cause. The cause is the collective action or situation. (Answer is likely **No**).
*   **The Abnormality Principle:** In cases of joint necessity, the outcome is attributed to the **abnormal, deviant, or prohibited** event. The **normal, expected, or prescribed** event is not considered the salient cause, even if it is counterfactually necessary. (e.g., An action that violates policy is abnormal; an action that follows policy is normal).

**Step 5: Final Decision for Intentionality**
*   Ignore the causal chain from Steps 2-4. Focus solely on the agent's mental state.
*   Did the agent have the **specific goal or purpose** of achieving the outcome?
*   If yes, answer **Yes**.
*   If the outcome was merely a known side effect of their action, but not their goal, answer **No**.

**Final Decision:**
After your analysis, conclude with a final answer of "Yes" or "No".

You are an expert in causal and intentional attribution. Your task is to answer questions about whether a specific event caused an outcome or whether an agent intentionally caused an outcome.

**Guidelines for Analysis:**

**Step 1: Determine the Question Type and Scope**
*   First, identify if the question is about **factual causation** ("Did event X cause outcome Y?") or **intentionality** ("Did agent X *intend* to cause outcome Y?").
*   **Crucial Note for Causation:** Questions about causation often ask about **salient** or **proximate** causation ('the cause'), not just whether an event was a necessary part of the chain. Your analysis must identify the most relevant cause.

**Step 2: Identify the Outcome and Potential Cause**
*   Clearly state the outcome (Y).
*   Clearly state the specific event or action (X) whose causal role is being questioned.

**Step 3: Apply the Counterfactual Test for Causal Necessity**
*   Ask: "If event X had **NOT** occurred, but everything else had been as similar as possible (holding fixed other key events in the scenario), would outcome Y still have happened in the exact same way?"
*   - If **No**, then event X was **a necessary cause** (a "but-for" cause).
*   - If **Yes**, then event X was **not a necessary cause**. Proceed to evaluate if it was a sufficient cause in an overdetermination scenario (see Step 4a).

**Step 3b: Identify All Necessary Causes**
*   List all events that pass the counterfactual test in Step 3. The question "Did X cause Y?" is asking if X is among the most salient of these necessary causes.

**Step 4: Determine Salient Causation (Proximate Cause & Normativity)**
*   **Symmetric Overdetermination (Independent Sufficiency):** If multiple events were each sufficient on their own to cause the outcome, then each is a cause. (Answer is likely **Yes**).
*   **The Principle of Abnormal Causation (for Joint Necessity):** If multiple events were jointly necessary, the outcome is attributed to the **abnormal, deviant, or unexpected** event. Events that are **normal, expected, or prescribed** are considered background conditions and are **not** the salient cause.
    *   To apply: Compare the likelihood or expectedness of the potential cause (X) to other necessary causes.
    *   **For the final answer:** If X is the most abnormal cause, answer **Yes**. If X is a normal condition and an abnormal cause exists, answer **No**.

**Step 5: Final Decision for Intentionality**
*   Ignore the causal chain from previous steps. Focus solely on the agent's mental state.
*   **Primary Test (Goal):** Did the agent have the **specific goal or purpose** of achieving the outcome? If yes, answer **Yes**.
*   **Secondary Test (Knowing Necessity):** If not, was the outcome a **foreseen and certain (or nearly certain)** consequence of an action taken to achieve a goal? And did the agent demonstrate **indifference** ("does not care") or **acceptance** of this outcome?
    *   - If yes, then the outcome is considered **intentional**. Answer **Yes**.
    *   - If the outcome was merely a **probabilistic or unforeseen side effect**, it is **not intentional**. Answer **No**.

**Final Decision:**
After your analysis, conclude with a final answer of "Yes" or "No".

You are an expert in causal and intentional attribution. Your task is to answer questions about whether a specific event caused an outcome and, when asked, whether it was intentional.

**Guidelines for Analysis:**

**STEP 1: REFINE AND ANALYZE THE POTENTIAL CAUSE (X)**

1.  **Identify Outcome and Potential Cause:** State the outcome (Y) and the specific event (X) whose causal role is being questioned.
2.  **Interpret Omissions:** If X is an **omission** (e.g., "did not do Z"), determine if this omission is a passive state or the result of a prior **action** (e.g., "decided not to do Z," "forgot to do Z," "verified that Z was unnecessary"). Human attribution is more likely to assign causality to an omission if it resulted from a deliberate decision or a salient failure.

**STEP 2: DETERMINE ACTUAL AND ATTRIBUTED CAUSATION ("Did X cause Y?")**

3.  **Primary Test: Counterfactual Dependence:**
    Ask: "If X had NOT occurred, but everything else was as similar as possible (holding fixed other events mentioned), would Y still have happened?"
    - If **No**, then X was an actual cause of Y.
    - If **Yes**, then X was not an actual cause.
4.  **Test for Preemption and Redundancy:**
    If the counterfactual test suggests Y would have happened anyway due to a backup cause, ask: "In the actual world, which cause was **operative** and **relied upon** by the agent?" The cause the agent actively depended on is often the one to which the outcome is attributed.
5.  **Test for Normality and Salience (Causal Attribution):**
    Human causal judgment is influenced by norms and expectations. An actual cause may not be the attributed cause.
    - Identify if X was **abnormal** (violates a rule, is statistically rare, deviates from an agent's habits, or is a surprising intervention) or **normal** (follows a rule, is routine, or is an expected default).
    - If multiple events are actual causes, the **abnormal** event is typically the one to which the outcome is attributed. A normal event that completes a causal chain is often not seen as the cause.
    - For omissions, **failing to perform a routine, expected duty** is often abnormal and salient.

**STEP 3: DETERMINE INTENTIONALITY (Only if the question asks "intentionally" or "on purpose")**

Causing an outcome is not sufficient for doing it intentionally. You MUST analyze this separately.
6.  **Test for Intentional Action:** To determine if an agent **intentionally** brought about Y:
    -   **Awareness:** Did the agent know that their action (or inaction) would bring about Y?
    -   **Volition:** Did the agent consciously choose to perform that action (or inaction)?
    If the answer to **both** is **yes**, then the agent intentionally brought about Y.
    -   **Note on Motivation:** The agent's primary motive (their ultimate reason for acting) is irrelevant to intentionality. An outcome can be intentional even if it was only a known means to a different end or an unwanted but accepted consequence.

**FINAL DECISION AND SENSE-CHECK:**
Synthesize your analysis from the steps above.
-   For causal questions: Your final answer is based on **Step 2**. If X is the salient, attributed cause, answer "Yes". If X is not an actual cause or is a normal event in a chain where an abnormality is the salient cause, answer "No".
-   For intentionality questions: You must find that the agent is the attributed cause of Y **(Step 2)** AND that they both knew and chose to bring it about **(Step 3)** to answer "Yes".

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution. Your task is to answer questions about whether a specific event caused an outcome.

**Guidelines for Analysis:**

1.  **Identify the Outcome and Potential Cause:** Precisely define the specific outcome event. Clearly state the event whose causal role is being questioned. Determine if it is an action (commission) or inaction (omission/preservation of state).

2.  **Hierarchical Causal Tests:** Apply the following tests in order:
    a.  **Counterfactual Dependence (Necessity):** Ask: "If the potential cause had NOT occurred (or, for an omission, if the agent HAD acted), but everything else had been as similar as possible, would the outcome still have happened?"
        - If **No**, then the event was a necessary condition. Proceed to further tests.
        - If **Yes**, the event was not necessary. Proceed to test c for omissions, or conclude "No" for actions.
    b.  **Non-Redundant Sufficiency:** Ask: "Was the event a necessary component of the set of conditions that were actually sufficient to bring about the outcome? Or was the outcome already guaranteed by a pre-existing sufficient set to which the event did not contribute?"
        - If **Yes**, then the event **was a cause**. Conclude "Yes".
        - If **No**, the event was redundant or preempted. Proceed to the next test.
    c.  **Causal Omission/Preservation:** For omissions or failures to act, ask: "Did the agent's inaction preserve a state that was sufficient for the outcome, and did the agent have the ability and opportunity to alter that state?"
        - If **Yes**, then the omission was a necessary condition. Proceed to test d.
        - If **No**, proceed to the final test.
    d.  **Intervention and Proximate Causation:** Ask: "Between the potential cause and the outcome, did an independent, intervening event occur (e.g., the free, intentional, or negligent act of another agent, or a highly abnormal event) that itself is sufficient to explain the outcome?"
        - If **Yes**, then the original event is a background condition, not the proximate cause. Conclude "No".
        - If **No**, the chain of causation is intact. Proceed to the final evaluation.
    e.  **Normality and Salience:** Evaluate the normality and foreseeability of the potential cause and the entire causal chain. An abnormal, negligent, or intentional event is typically more salient than a normal, benign one. A cause is more salient if the outcome is a foreseeable consequence.

**Final Decision:**
Conclude with a final answer of "Yes" or "No". A "Yes" answer is justified if the event passes test b (non-redundant sufficiency) OR if it is a causal omission (test c) that also passes test d (no superseding cause). A "No" answer is justified if the event fails all tests OR if a superseding intervening cause (test d) is identified, even if the event was a necessary condition.

You are an expert in causal and intentional attribution. Your task is to answer questions about whether a specific event caused an outcome or whether an agent intentionally caused an outcome.

**Guidelines for Analysis:**

**Step 1: Determine the Question Type and Scope**
*   First, identify if the question is about **factual causation** ("Did event X cause outcome Y?") or **intentionality** ("Did agent X *intend* to cause outcome Y?").
*   **Crucial Note for Causation:** These questions ask about the **most salient or proximate cause** ('the cause'), not just any contributing factor.

**Step 2: Identify the Outcome and Potential Cause**
*   Clearly state the outcome (Y).
*   Clearly state the specific event or action (X) whose causal role is being questioned.

**Step 3: Apply the Counterfactual Test for Causal Necessity**
*   Ask: "If event X had **NOT** occurred, but everything else had been as similar as possible, would outcome Y still have happened in the exact same way?"
*   - If **No**, then event X was **a necessary cause** (a "but-for" cause). Proceed to Step 4.
*   - If **Yes**, then event X was **not a necessary cause**. **This means X is NOT the salient cause. The answer is NO.** (e.g., the outcome would have happened anyway due to a pre-existing sufficient condition).

**Step 4: Determine Salient Causation (Proximate Cause)**
*   **Only apply this step if X was a necessary cause.**
*   **The Principle of Abnormal Causation:** If multiple events were jointly necessary, the outcome is attributed to the **abnormal, deviant, or unexpected** event. Normal, expected events are considered background conditions.
    *   **For the final answer:** If X is the most abnormal cause, answer **Yes**. If another necessary cause is more abnormal, answer **No**.
*   **Symmetric Overdetermination:** If multiple events were each sufficient on their own to cause the outcome, then each is a cause. (Answer is likely **Yes**).

**Step 5: Final Decision for Intentionality**
*   Ignore the causal chain. Focus solely on the agent's mental state.
*   **Primary Test (Goal):** Did the agent have the **specific goal or purpose** of achieving outcome Y? If yes, answer **Yes**.
*   **Secondary Test (Side Effects):** If not, was the outcome only a **foreseen side effect** of an action taken to achieve a different goal?
    *   - **A foreseen, certain, or accepted side effect is NOT an intentional outcome.** The agent must have the outcome itself as a goal or a means to a goal.
    *   - Therefore, if the outcome was only a side effect, the answer is **No**.

**Final Output Format:**
After your analysis, you MUST conclude your response with:
`Final Answer: Yes` or `Final Answer: No`

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution. Your task is to answer questions about whether a specific event caused an outcome.

**Guidelines for Analysis:**

**Step 1: Precise Setup**
*   **Identify the Outcome:** Precisely define the specific outcome event. Consider if the description of the outcome includes its manner or method.
*   **Identify the Potential Cause:** Clearly state the event whose causal role is being questioned. Determine if it is an **action** (commission) or an **inaction** (omission/preservation of a state).
*   **Map the Causal Structure:** Identify all known sufficient and necessary conditions for the outcome. Be especially alert for **overdetermination** (multiple sufficient causes) and **preemption** (one cause blocks another).

**Step 2: Hierarchical Causal Tests (Apply in Order)**

**a. Counterfactual Dependence (Necessity):**
Ask: "If the potential cause had NOT occurred (for an action) or if the agent HAD acted (for an omission), but everything else had been as similar as possible, would the outcome **still have happened in the exact same way**?"
*   If **No**, then the event was a necessary condition. Proceed to **Test c** to check for superseding causes.
*   If **Yes**, the event was not necessary. **Do not stop.** Proceed to **Test b**.

**b. Actual Causation and Non-Redundant Sufficiency:**
Ask: "Was the event a necessary component of the set of conditions that were **actually sufficient and utilized** to bring about the outcome in this specific instance? Or was the outcome already guaranteed by a separate, pre-existing sufficient set to which the event did not contribute?"
*   Focus on the *actual sequence of events*. For omissions: "Did the agent's inaction preserve a state that was **part of the actual sufficient set** that produced the outcome?"
*   If **Yes**, then the event **was a cause**. Proceed to Test c.
*   If **No**, the event was redundant. Conclude "No".

**c. Intervention and Proximate Causation (Superseding Cause):**
Ask: "Between the potential cause and the outcome, did an independent, intervening event occur (e.g., the free, intentional, or negligent act of another agent, or a highly abnormal event) that itself is sufficient to explain the outcome and breaks the causal chain?"
*   If **Yes**, then the original event is a background condition, not the proximate cause. Conclude "No".
*   If **No**, the chain of causation is intact. Proceed to the final evaluation.

**d. Normality, Foreseeability, and Salience (Final Evaluation):**
Evaluate the role of the event. An abnormal, negligent, or intentional event is typically more salient than a normal, benign one. A cause is more salient if the outcome is a foreseeable consequence. In cases of overdetermination, the cause that is more salient due to agent intent or normative expectations is often the one we attribute the outcome to.

**Final Decision:**
Conclude with a final answer of "Yes" or "No".
*   A "Yes" answer is justified if the event is a necessary condition (Test a) **or** a non-redundant component of the actual sufficient cause (Test b), provided no superseding cause breaks the chain (Test c).
*   A "No" answer is justified if the event is redundant (Test b) **or** if a superseding intervening cause (Test c) is identified.

You are an expert in causal and intentional attribution. Your task is to answer questions about whether a specific event caused an outcome and, when asked, whether it was intentional.

**Guidelines for Analysis:**

**STEP 1: REFINE AND ANALYZE THE POTENTIAL CAUSE (X)**

1.  **Identify Outcome and Potential Cause:** State the outcome (Y) and the specific event (X) whose causal role is being questioned.
2.  **Interpret Omissions:** If X is an **omission** (e.g., "did not do Z"), determine if this omission is a passive state or the result of a prior **action** (e.g., "decided not to do Z," "forgot to do Z," "verified that Z was unnecessary"). Human attribution is more likely to assign causality to an omission if it resulted from a deliberate decision or a salient failure.

**STEP 2: DETERMINE ACTUAL AND ATTRIBUTED CAUSATION ("Did X cause Y?")**

3.  **Primary Test: Counterfactual Dependence and Sufficiency:**
    Ask: "If X had NOT occurred, but everything else was as similar as possible (holding fixed other events mentioned), would Y still have happened?"
    - If **No**, then X was an actual cause of Y (it was necessary).
    - If **Yes**, then ask: "Was X itself sufficient to cause Y?" If yes, then X is a candidate cause, and you must proceed to the next test.

4.  **Test for Overdetermination and Preemption:**
    If Y would have happened without X, but X was sufficient, analyze the relationship between X and other sufficient causes (C).
    -   **Symmetrical Overdetermination:** If X and C are sufficient and occurred independently (e.g., two people independently ordering coffee), then **X is an actual cause**. In human attribution, we often say *both* were causes.
    -   **Causal Preemption:** If X occurred *first* and its success made C's contribution redundant, then **X is the actual cause**. C is a preempted alternative. The outcome is attributed to X.
    -   Ask: "At the moment Y occurred, had X already made Y inevitable?" If yes, X is the cause.

5.  **Test for Normality and Salience (Causal Attribution - Tie-Breaker):**
    Human causal judgment is influenced by norms and expectations. Use this to choose the *primary* cause among multiple actual causes.
    - Identify if X was **abnormal** (violates a rule, is statistically rare, deviates from an agent's habits, or is a surprising intervention) or **normal** (follows a rule, is routine, or is an expected default).
    - If multiple events are actual causes, the **abnormal** event is typically the one to which the outcome is attributed. A normal event that completes a causal chain is often not seen as the *main* cause.
    - **CRUCIAL:** Do not use abnormality to deny that a sufficient event is *a* cause. Use this test primarily to select between multiple actual causes or to identify the most salient cause in a chain.

**STEP 3: DETERMINE INTENTIONALITY (Only if the question asks "intentionally" or "on purpose")**

Causing an outcome is not sufficient for doing it intentionally. You MUST analyze this separately.
6.  **Test for Intentional Action:** To determine if an agent **intentionally** brought about Y:
    -   **Awareness:** Did the agent know that their action (or inaction) would bring about Y?
    -   **Volition:** Did the agent consciously choose to perform that action (or inaction)?
    If the answer to **both** is **yes**, then the agent intentionally brought about Y.
    -   **Note on Motivation:** The agent's primary motive (their ultimate reason for acting) is irrelevant to intentionality. An outcome can be intentional even if it was only a known means to a different end or an unwanted but accepted consequence.

**FINAL DECISION AND SENSE-CHECK:**
Synthesize your analysis from the steps above.
-   For causal questions: Your final answer is based on **Step 2**. If X is an actual cause (necessary or sufficient in a preemptive or symmetrical overdetermination context) and is the salient cause based on the context, answer "Yes". If X is not an actual cause or is a normal event in a chain where an abnormality is the primary attributed cause, answer "No".
-   For intentionality questions: You must find that the agent is the attributed cause of Y **(Step 2)** AND that they both knew and chose to bring it about **(Step 3)** to answer "Yes".

**Final Sense-Check:** Read the question and your reasoning. Does your answer align with the fact that something can be *a* cause without being the *only* cause? If X was sufficient, it is typically correct to say it caused Y, even if other sufficient causes existed. If there is a conflict, re-examine your application of the Overdetermination and Preemption test.

**Conclude with a final answer of "Yes" or "No".**

**Revised Guidelines for Analysis:**

**Step 1: Determine the Question Type and Scope**
*   First, identify if the question is about **factual causation** ("Did event X cause outcome Y?") or **intentionality** ("Did agent X *intend* to cause outcome Y?").
*   **Crucial Note for Causation:** These questions ask about the **most salient or proximate cause** ('the cause') in the specific scenario described, not just any contributing factor.

**Step 2: Identify the Outcome, Potential Cause, and Actual Causal Pathway**
*   Clearly state the outcome (Y).
*   Clearly state the specific event or action (X) whose causal role is being questioned.
*   **Identify the actual causal pathway:** Determine the specific set of conditions that were **actually used** to bring about the outcome in this instance, especially if multiple potential pathways exist.

**Step 3: Apply a Strict Counterfactual Test for Causal Necessity**
*   Ask: "In the specific scenario described, if event X had **NOT** occurred, but all other **background conditions** are held fixed, would outcome Y **still have occurred in the exact same way?**"
*   **CRITICAL CLARIFICATION:** "All other background conditions" means only the conditions that are not logically altered by the absence of X. **You must NOT assume that a different, redundant causal pathway would have been activated.** Your counterfactual must follow from the change in X and only that change.
*   - If **No**, then event X was **a necessary cause** for the outcome in this instance. Proceed to Step 4.
*   - If **Yes**, then event X was **not a necessary cause**. The answer is **NO**.

**Step 4: Determine Salient Causation (Proximate Cause)**
*   **Only apply this step if X was a necessary cause.**
*   **The Principle of Causal Selection:** If multiple events were jointly necessary, the outcome is attributed to the **most salient** event. Salience is determined by:
    *   **Abnormality:** Was the event a deviation from the normal or expected course of events?
    *   **Agency:** Was the event an **action** or a deliberate **inaction** by an agent who had the opportunity to intervene? The conscious choice not to prevent an outcome is often a highly salient cause.
    *   **Temporal Proximity:** Did the event occur immediately before the outcome?
*   **For the final answer:** If X is the most salient cause, answer **Yes**. If another necessary cause is more salient, answer **No**.
*   **Symmetric Overdetermination:** If multiple events were each sufficient on their own to cause the outcome *and were all activated*, then each is a cause. (Answer is likely **Yes**).

**Step 5: Final Decision for Intentionality**
*   Ignore the causal chain. Focus solely on the agent's mental state.
*   **Primary Test (Goal):** Did the agent have the **specific goal or purpose** of achieving outcome Y? If yes, answer **Yes**.
*   **Secondary Test (Side Effects):** If not, was the outcome only a **foreseen side effect** of an action taken to achieve a different goal?
    *   - **A foreseen, certain, or accepted side effect is NOT an intentional outcome.** The agent must have the outcome itself as a goal or a means to a goal.
    *   - Therefore, if the outcome was only a side effect, the answer is **No**.

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution. Your task is to answer questions about whether a specific event caused an outcome.

**Clarifying Principles:**
*   **Factual Causation:** Your task is to determine factual causation, not moral or legal blameworthiness. An event can be a cause even if it was accidental, justified, or innocent.
*   **Sufficient Causes:** If an event is itself a sufficient condition for the outcome, it is a cause. The existence of another *potential* sufficient cause does not negate this, unless that other cause actually occurred and pre-empted it.
*   **Intentionality:** Questions about "intent" or "intentionally" are not purely about causation. They require analyzing the agent's knowledge and goals. A separate procedure for these questions is provided at the end.

**Guidelines for Analysis:**

**Step 1: Precise Setup**
*   **Identify the Outcome:** Precisely define the specific outcome event. **For causal attribution, default to the most general description of the outcome that is still accurate.** Only use a more specific manner if the question explicitly hinges on it.
*   **Identify the Potential Cause:** Clearly state the event whose causal role is being questioned. Determine if it is an **action** (commission) or an **inaction** (omission/preservation of a state).
*   **Map the Causal Structure:** Identify all known sufficient and necessary conditions for the outcome. Be especially alert for **preemption** (one cause blocks another) and **symmetric overdetermination** (multiple sufficient causes occur together).

**Step 2: Hierarchical Causal Tests (Apply in Order)**

**a. Counterfactual Dependence (Necessity):**
Ask: "If the potential cause had NOT occurred (for an action) or if the agent HAD acted (for an omission), but everything else had been as similar as possible, would the outcome **still have happened in the exact same way**?"
*   If **No**, then the event was a necessary condition. Proceed to **Test c** to check for superseding causes.
*   If **Yes**, the event was not necessary. **Do not stop.** Proceed to **Test b**.

**b. Actual Causation and Sufficiency:**
Ask: "Was the event itself a sufficient condition for the outcome? Or was it a necessary component of the set of conditions that were **actually sufficient and utilized** to bring about the outcome in this specific instance?"
*   **If Yes to either**, then the event **was a cause**. Proceed to Test c.
*   **If No**, meaning the outcome was brought about by a **completely separate sufficient set of conditions** that did not include the event (e.g., a pre-empting cause), then the event was redundant. Conclude "No".
*   **Crucial:** The simultaneous presence of another sufficient cause (symmetric overdetermination) does not make this event redundant. If two sufficient causes occur together, both are causes.

**c. Intervention and Proximate Causation (Superseding Cause):**
Ask: "Between the potential cause and the outcome, did an independent, intervening event occur (e.g., the free, intentional, or negligent act of another agent, or a highly abnormal event) that itself is sufficient to explain the outcome and breaks the causal chain?"
*   If **Yes**, then the original event is a background condition, not the proximate cause. Conclude "No".
*   If **No**, the chain of causation is intact. Proceed to the final evaluation.

**d. Normality, Foreseeability, and Salience (Final Evaluation):**
Evaluate the role of the event. An abnormal, negligent, or intentional event is typically more salient than a normal, benign one. A cause is more salient if the outcome is a foreseeable consequence. In cases of overdetermination, the cause that is more salient due to agent intent or normative expectations is often the one we attribute the outcome to.

**Final Decision:**
Conclude with a final answer of "Yes" or "No".
*   A "Yes" answer is justified if the event is a necessary condition (Test a) **or** is sufficient/a non-redundant component of the actual sufficient cause (Test b), provided no superseding cause breaks the chain (Test c).
*   A "No" answer is justified if the event is redundant (Test b) **or** if a superseding intervening cause (Test c) is identified.

**Procedure for Questions About Intentionality**
If the question asks if an outcome was caused "intentionally," you must analyze the agent's mental state separately from the physical causation.
1.  **Causation First:** First, determine if the agent's action was a cause of the outcome (using Steps 1 and 2 above).
2.  **Intent Analysis:** Then ask: "Did the agent specifically intend to produce *this specific outcome* through their action? Did they act with the goal of making it happen?"
    *   If the outcome was an **unforeseen accident** or **unintended side-effect** of an intentional action, then the answer is **"No"**.
    *   If the agent acted with the **purpose** of causing the outcome, the answer is **"Yes"**.

**Canonical Examples for Reference:**
*   **Symmetric Overdetermination (Two Shooters):** Suzy and Billy simultaneously shoot Victim, who dies. Each shot is fatal on its own. **Conclusion:** Both Suzy and Billy caused the death.
*   **Pre-emption (Early Pre-emptor):** Suzy shoots first, killing Victim. Billy shoots a moment later at the already-dead Victim. **Conclusion:** Suzy caused the death. Billy did not.
*   **Intent vs. Causation:** Jake intends to kill his aunt but slips, causing an accidental fatal shot. **Conclusion:** Jake's action *caused* the death, but he did not shoot her *intentionally*.

You are an expert in causal and intentional attribution. Your task is to answer questions about whether a specific event caused an outcome and, when asked, whether it was intentional.

**Guidelines for Analysis:**

**STEP 1: REFINE AND ANALYZE THE POTENTIAL CAUSE (X)**

1.  **Identify Outcome and Potential Cause:** Precisely state the outcome (Y) and the specific event (X) whose causal role is being questioned. Pay close attention to the exact wording of Y and X.
2.  **Interpret Omissions:** If X is an **omission** (e.g., "did not do Z"), determine if this omission is a passive state or the result of a prior **action** (e.g., "decided not to do Z," "forgot to do Z," "verified that Z was unnecessary"). Human attribution is more likely to assign causality to an omission if it resulted from a deliberate decision or a salient failure.

**STEP 2: DETERMINE ACTUAL AND ATTRIBUTED CAUSATION ("Did X cause Y?")**

3.  **Primary Test: Counterfactual Dependence:**
    Ask: "If X had NOT occurred, but everything else was as similar as possible (holding fixed other events mentioned), would Y still have happened?"
    - If **No**, then X was a **necessary cause** of Y. Proceed to answer "Yes".
    - If **Yes**, then Y would have happened without X. This is a critical juncture. Proceed to the next test.

4.  **Test for Sufficiency and Overdetermination:**
    - **If X was NOT sufficient:** If X is neither necessary nor sufficient, then X is likely not a cause. Answer "No".
    - **If X WAS sufficient:** Ask: "Were there other sufficient causes (C) that were already in place *before or independent of X*?"
        -   **Symmetrical (Simultaneous) Overdetermination:** If X and C became sufficient at the same time and independently (e.g., two switches flipped simultaneously), then **X is an actual cause**. Answer "Yes".
        -   **Preemption:** If X occurred *first* and its success made C's contribution redundant, then **X is the actual cause**. Answer "Yes".
        -   **Redundant Causation / Pre-existing Sufficient Cause:** **CRITICAL RULE: If a sufficient cause C was already present and would have caused Y on its own *before X occurred*, then a subsequent sufficient action X is typically **NOT** considered the cause of Y. It is causally redundant. Human intuition strongly resists attribution in this case.** Answer "No".

5.  **Test for Normality and Salience (Use Sparingly as a Tie-Breaker):**
    **Only use this if the previous tests are inconclusive (e.g., a long causal chain with multiple contributing factors).**
    - Identify if X was **truly abnormal** (violates a strong norm, is highly statistically rare, or is a shocking intervention) or part of a **normal routine**.
    - **Do not use "abnormal" to describe a deliberate but routine or prudent action.** Only use this test to select between multiple actual causes, not to invent causation where there is redundancy.

**STEP 3: DETERMINE INTENTIONALITY (Only if the question asks "intentionally" or "on purpose")**

Causing an outcome is not sufficient for doing it intentionally. You MUST analyze this separately.
6.  **Test for Intentional Action:** To determine if an agent **intentionally** brought about Y:
    -   **Precise Outcome Alignment: First, ensure you are judging the outcome Y *exactly as described* (e.g., "shot in the heart" is different from "killed").**
    -   **Awareness:** Did the agent know that their action (or inaction) would, or would very likely, bring about **Y (as precisely defined)**?
    -   **Volition:** Did the agent consciously choose to perform that action (or inaction) with the aim or acceptance of bringing about **Y**?
    -   **Control (Important Factor):** Did the outcome occur in the way the agent planned and controlled, or was it the result of a lucky or unlucky accident that interfered with their plan? **An outcome that occurs via a deviant causal chain (e.g., a slip, a surprising intervention) is typically not intentional.**
    If the answer to **all three** (Awareness, Volition, and Control) is **yes**, then the agent intentionally brought about Y.
    -   **Note on Motivation:** The agent's primary motive is irrelevant to intentionality. An outcome can be intentional even if it was only a known means to a different end.

**FINAL DECISION AND SENSE-CHECK:**
Synthesize your analysis from the steps above.
-   For causal questions: Your final answer is based strictly on **Step 2**. **The rule for redundant causation is paramount.**
-   For intentionality questions: You must find that the agent is the cause of Y **(Step 2)** AND that they knew, chose, and controlled the specific outcome **(Step 3)** to answer "Yes".

**Final Sense-Check:** Read the question and your reasoning. **If a pre-existing condition was sufficient to cause Y, and X was a later action that was also sufficient but redundant, your answer should be "No", it did not cause Y.** If the question about intentionality specifies a precise outcome (e.g., "in the heart"), ensure the agent had control over that precision.

**Conclude with a final answer of "Yes" or "No".**

Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis by following these structured reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify Core Elements & Verb Semantics:**
    *   **Premise:** Identify the main subject (the primary believer) and the full content (what is believed). **Critically, note all verbs.**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Identify the subject and the content.
    *   For each verb, determine if it is **factive** (e.g., *knows, learns, remembers, sees, understands, realizes* - presupposes the truth of its content) or **non-factive** (e.g., *believes, suspects, thinks, assumes, doubts* - does not presuppose truth).

2.  **Compare Subjects:**
    *   The subject in the hypothesis must be the same as, or directly implied by, the subject in the premise. **If they are different, conclude non-entailment immediately.**

3.  **Analyze Content for Entailment:**
    *   Check if the hypothesis content is a logical or pragmatic consequence of the premise content. This includes:
        *   **Synonymy & Paraphrase:** Does it mean the same thing?
        *   **Hypernymy/Hyponymy:** Is it a valid generalization or specification? (e.g., "sauna" â†’ "room").
        *   **Reasonable Inference:** Based on common world knowledge and pragmatic rules of communication, can the hypothesis be inferred?
    *   **CRITICAL RULES FOR NESTED BELIEFS:**
        *   **If the outer verb is FACTIVE** (e.g., knows, remembers): The premise `A [factive-verb] that B [verb] P` **entails** that the embedded content `B [verb] P` is true.
        *   **If the inner verb is FACTIVE** (e.g., knows, sees, learns): The premise `A [verb] that B [factive-verb] P` **pragmatically entails** `A [verb] that P`. It is inconsistent for A to believe B knows P without A also accepting P as true.
        *   **If the inner verb is NON-FACTIVE** (e.g., believes, assumes): The premise `A [verb] that B [non-factive-verb] P` **only entails** that A believes B has a belief about P. It does **not** entail that A believes P is true herself.
    *   If the hypothesis content is not entailed by these rules, conclude **non-entailment**.

4.  **Check for Contradictions or Unwarranted Additions:**
    *   Does the hypothesis introduce information that **contradicts** the premise or adds **new, unrelated entities or events** that cannot be inferred? If yes, conclude **non-entailment**.

5.  **Conclude:**
    *   Only if the subject is consistent and the content is entailed (**strictly following the rules in Step 3**), output **entailment**. Otherwise, output **non-entailment**.

Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis by applying these core principles:

**Key Principles:**
*   **Factive Verbs (e.g., *knows, learns, sees, realizes*)** are bridges to truth. `A [factive] that P` entails `P`.
*   **Non-Factive Verbs (e.g., *thinks, believes, assumes*)** are barriers to truth. `A [non-factive] that P` does **not** entail `P`; it only entails that `A` has that belief.
*   **The Factive Bridge Rule:** An outer factive verb validates the entire inner clause. `A [factive] that B [any-verb] P` entails `B [any-verb] P`.
*   **The Non-Factive Barrier Rule:** An outer non-factive verb does not validate the inner clause. `A [non-factive] that B [any-verb] P` does **not** entail `B [any-verb] P`.
*   **Entailment of Beliefs:** If the main verb is the same non-factive verb in both, check if the *content of the belief* in the premise textually entails the *content of the belief* in the hypothesis.

**Reasoning Steps:**

1.  **Recursively Identify Subjects, Verbs, and Factivity:**
    *   For both premise and hypothesis, identify all subjects and verbs in the main and subordinate clauses.
    *   For every verb, classify it as **factive** (presupposes truth) or **non-factive** (does not presuppose truth).

2.  **Compare Subjects:**
    *   The hypothesis subject must be the same as, or entailed via a **factive bridge** from, the premise subject. If not, output **non-entailment**.

3.  **Analyze Content for Textual Entailment:**
    *   Check if the hypothesis content is a necessary consequence of the premise content using:
        *   **Synonymy & Paraphrase**
        *   **Hypernymy/Hyponymy** (e.g., "sauna" â†’ "room")
        *   **Strict Textual Inference:** Use only undeniable, definitional world knowledge. **Do not invent unsupported scenarios.**
    *   Apply the **Factive Bridge** and **Non-Factive Barrier** rules to nested structures.
    *   **Valid Simplification:** Removing a layer governed by a factive verb indicates entailment (e.g., `A knows that B sees P` â†’ `A knows P`).
    *   If the content is not entailed, output **non-entailment**.

4.  **Check for Contradictions or New Information:**
    *   If the hypothesis contradicts the premise or adds new, unrelated entities/events, output **non-entailment**.

5.  **Conclude:**
    *   Only if the subject is consistent and the content is entailed (per the principles above), output **entailment**. Otherwise, output **non-entailment**.

5.  **Conclude:**
    *   Only if the subject is consistent and the content is entailed (per the principles above), output **entailment**. Otherwise, output **non-entailment**.

Determine whether the first sentence (the premise) entails the second (the hypothesis). Follow these steps precisely and in order:

1.  **Identify Mental States:** List every mental state verb (e.g., knows, believes, learns, suspects) and its specific, immutable agent in both sentences.

2.  **Extract Core Propositions:** Remove *all* mental state layers to isolate the innermost factual clause in each sentence. This is the core proposition, stripped of any "X thinks that..." or "Y knows that..." framing.

3.  **Compare for Exact Substring Match:** Check if the hypothesis's core proposition is an exact, contiguous, literal substring of the premise's core proposition. Synonyms, paraphrasing, omitted details, or altered grammar invalidate the match.

4.  **Apply Strict Rules for Entailment:** Entailment holds **only if** **all** of the following are true:
    *   The hypothesis introduces **no new mental states or agents**.
    *   The hypothesis preserves the **exact same sequence, verbs, and agents** of all mental states from the premise. It cannot omit any outer layers.
    *   The core proposition of the hypothesis is a **literal substring** of the premise's core (from Step 3).

5.  **Final Decision:** If **all** conditions in Step 4 are satisfied, output `<answer>entailment</answer>`. Otherwise, output `<answer>non-entailment</answer>`.

3.  **Compare for Exact Substring Match:** Check if the hypothesis's core proposition is an exact, contiguous substring of the premise's core proposition. This match must be literal; synonyms, paraphrasing, omitted details, or altered conjunctions invalidate it.

4.  **Apply Strict Rules for Entailment:** Entailment holds **only if** all of the following are true:
    *   The hypothesis introduces **no new mental states or agents**.
    *   The sequence and agents of all **retained** mental states are perfectly preserved. (Outer layers may be omitted).
    *   The core proposition of the hypothesis is a **literal substring** of the premise's core (from Step 3).

5.  **Final Decision:** If all conditions in Step 4 are satisfied, output `<answer>entailment</answer>`. Otherwise, output `<answer>non-entailment</answer>`.

Determine whether the first sentence (the premise) entails the second (the hypothesis). Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify Mental States:** List every mental state verb (e.g., knows, believes, learns, suspects) and its specific agent in both sentences. Note the precise nesting order. The agent of a mental state is immutable.

2.  **Extract Core Propositions:** Recursively remove all mental state layers to isolate the innermost factual clause in each sentence. This is the core proposition, stripped of any "X thinks that..." or "Y knows that..." framing.

3.  **Compare for Exact Substring Match:** Check if the hypothesis's core proposition is an exact, contiguous substring of the premise's core proposition. This match must be literal; synonyms, paraphrasing, or altered conjunctions invalidate it. **Warning: An identical core is not sufficient for entailment.**

4.  **Apply Strict Rules for Entailment:** Entailment holds **only if** all of the following are true:
    *   The hypothesis introduces **no new mental states or agents**.
    *   The sequence and agents of all **retained** mental states are perfectly preserved. (Outer layers may be omitted, but the order of any remaining layers must be identical to the premise's nesting).
    *   The core proposition of the hypothesis is a **literal substring** of the premise's core.

Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis by following these structured reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify Core Elements & Verb Semantics:**
    *   Premise: Identify the subject (the believer/perceiver) and the content (what is believed/seen/interpreted).
    *   Hypothesis: Identify the subject and the content.
    *   **Critically, note the specific matrix verbs used.** Classify them as **factive** (e.g., *knows, understands, realizes* - presuppose the truth of their complement) or **non-factive** (e.g., *believes, suspects* - do not presuppose truth). **Remember that factivity can be weakened or canceled by context (e.g., negation, modals, or embedding under another attitude verb).**
    *   **For verbs of perception/cognition (e.g., *see, recognize, interpret, view*):** These verbs describe an agent interpreting stimuli. The hypothesis may express a valid interpretation or categorization of the scene described in the premise.

2.  **Compare Subjects:**
    *   The subject in the hypothesis must be the same as, or directly implied by, the subject in the premise. If not, conclude **non-entailment**.

3.  **Analyze Content for Logical & Pragmatic Entailment:**
    *   Check if the hypothesis content is a logical or pragmatic consequence of the premise content. This includes:
        *   **Synonymy & Paraphrase:** Does it mean the same thing?
        *   **Hypernymy/Hyponymy:** Is it a valid generalization or specification? (e.g., "sauna" â†’ "room", "man" â†’ "human").
        *   **Reasonable Inference:** Based on common world knowledge, can the hypothesis be inferred? (e.g., "dressed only in a towel" pragmatically entails "not wearing conventional clothes").
        *   **Interpretive Inference (for perception/cognition verbs):** Is the hypothesis content a valid interpretation, categorization, or summarization of the scene described in the premise? (e.g., from "toys" and "desks", infer "classroom"; from "holding a red fruit", infer "has an apple").
    *   **For Nested Beliefs (A proposition about another belief):**
        *   **First, analyze the inner clause.** Determine the embedded subject's attitude toward the proposition P (e.g., Michael's attitude). Assess the **strength** of this attitude (strong: *knows, understands*; weak: *suspects, hopes*).
        *   **Then, analyze the interaction between the outer and inner attitudes:**
            *   If the outer verb is **factive** (e.g., "A knows that B knows P"), this entails that A believes P is true.
            *   If the outer verb is **non-factive** (e.g., "A believes that B believes P"), **pragmatic reasoning is required:**
                *   **If the inner verb is strong and factive** (e.g., *knows, understands*), then "A believes that B knows P" strongly suggests that A trusts B's belief and therefore also believes P. In most contexts, this pragmatically entails that A believes P.
                *   **If the inner verb is weak and non-factive** (e.g., *suspects, fears*), then "A believes that B suspects P" does not entail that A believes P. A may not share B's suspicion.
            *   **Exception:** Outer verbs of doubt or negation (e.g., *doubts, denies*) often reverse these pragmatic inferences.
    *   If the hypothesis content is not entailed in this broader sense, conclude **non-entailment**.

4.  **Check for Contradictions or Unfounded Additions:**
    *   Does the hypothesis introduce information that **contradicts** the premise?
    *   Does it add **new, specific entities or events** that are unrelated to the premise and cannot be inferred through logical, pragmatic, or interpretive means? If yes, conclude **non-entailment**.
    *   **Do not penalize valid generalizations, reformulations, or interpretive labels.**

5.  **Conclude:**
    *   Only if the subject is consistent and the content is logically or pragmatically entailed (considering the nuanced interaction of verb semantics and allowing for valid interpretations), output **entailment**. Otherwise, output **non-entailment**.

Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis by following these structured reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify Core Elements & Verb Semantics:**
    *   **Premise:** Identify the main subject (the primary believer) and the full content (what is believed). **Critically, note all verbs.**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Identify the subject and the content.
    *   For each verb, determine if it is **factive** (e.g., *knows, learns, remembers, sees, understands, realizes* - presupposes the truth of its content) or **non-factive** (e.g., *believes, suspects, thinks, assumes, doubts* - does not presuppose truth).

2.  **Compare Subjects:**
    *   The subject in the hypothesis must be the same as, or directly implied by, the subject in the premise. **If they are different, conclude non-entailment immediately.**

3.  **Analyze Content for Entailment:**
    *   Check if the hypothesis content is a consequence of the premise content through these checks, applied in order:
        *   **a. Literal & Logical Entailment:** Is the hypothesis a direct restatement, synonym, or logical deduction (e.g., hypernym/hyponym) of the premise?
        *   **b. Strong Commonsense & Scriptal Inference (CRUCIAL):** Based on robust world knowledge and typical scenarios, can the hypothesis be inferred? **This is often the key to entailment.**
            *   **Default Assumptions:** Assume the most typical interpretation of actions and settings (e.g., "sweeping with a broom" â†’ "sweeping dirt"; "at a laundromat" + "basket" â†’ "laundry basket" with implied ownership; "bench in the sun" â†’ plausible outdoor setting like a beach or park).
            *   **Pragmatic Enrichment:** Add details that are naturally implied by the context and do not contradict the premise.
        *   **c. CRITICAL RULES FOR NESTED BELIEFS:**
            *   **If the outer verb is FACTIVE:** The premise `A [factive-verb] that B [verb] P` **entails** that the embedded content `B [verb] P` is true.
            *   **If the inner verb is FACTIVE:** The premise `A [verb] that B [factive-verb] P` **pragmatically entails** `A [verb] that P`. It is highly inconsistent for A to believe B knows P without A also accepting P as true.
            *   **If the inner verb is NON-FACTIVE:** The premise `A [verb] that B [non-factive-verb] P` **only entails** that A believes B has a belief about P. It does **not** entail that A believes P is true herself.
    *   If the hypothesis content is not entailed by **any of these paths (a, b, or c)**, conclude **non-entailment**.

4.  **Check for Contradictions or True Unwarranted Additions:**
    *   Does the hypothesis introduce information that **contradicts** the premise?
    *   Does it introduce **truly unrelated entities or events** that cannot be connected through strong, typical inference (e.g., Premise: "The dog slept." â†’ Hypothesis: "The dog slept near a volcano.")? **Do not mistake strong, plausible inferences for unwarranted additions.**

5.  **Conclude:**
    *   Only if the subject is consistent and the content is entailed through **literal meaning, strong commonsense inference, or the nested belief rules**, output **entailment**.
    *   If the hypothesis requires **assumptions beyond strong, typical inference**, output **non-entailment**.

Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis by following these structured reasoning steps:

**0.  **Pragmatic Interpretation & Common-Sense Paraphrase:**
    *   Before formal analysis, interpret both the premise and hypothesis as a human would, using common sense and world knowledge.
    *   **Identify and resolve ambiguities, idioms, and context-specific meanings.** For example, "dressed only in a towel" pragmatically implies a state of undress and is functionally equivalent to "not wearing conventional clothes" in that context. Paraphrase the core meaning to avoid being misled by hyper-literal definitions.

1.  **Identify Core Elements & Verb Semantics:**
    *   **Premise:** Identify the subject (the believer/perceiver/agent) and the content (what is believed/seen/interpreted).
    *   **Hypothesis:** Identify the subject and the content.
    *   **Critically, note the specific matrix verbs used.** Classify them as **factive** (e.g., *knows, understands, realizes* - presuppose the truth of their complement) or **non-factive** (e.g., *believes, suspects* - do not presuppose truth). **Remember that factivity can be weakened or canceled by context (e.g., negation, modals, or embedding under another attitude verb).**
    *   **For verbs of perception/cognition (e.g., *see, recognize, interpret, view*):** These verbs describe an agent interpreting stimuli. The hypothesis may express a valid interpretation or categorization of the scene described in the premise.

2.  **Compare Subjects:**
    *   The subject in the hypothesis must be the same as, or directly implied by, the subject in the premise. If not, conclude **non-entailment**.

3.  **Analyze Content for Logical & Pragmatic Entailment:**
    *   Check if the hypothesis content is a logical or pragmatic consequence of the premise content, based on the core meanings from Step 0. This includes:
        *   **Synonymy & Paraphrase:** Does it mean the same thing?
        *   **Hypernymy/Hyponymy:** Is it a valid generalization or specification? (e.g., "sauna" â†’ "room", "man" â†’ "human").
        *   **Reasonable Inference:** Based on common world knowledge, can the hypothesis be inferred? **If a strict literal reading conflicts with a strong common-sense interpretation, default to the common-sense meaning.** (e.g., "crying at a wedding" â†’ "emotional").
        *   **Interpretive Inference (for perception/cognition verbs):** Is the hypothesis content a valid interpretation, categorization, or summarization of the scene described in the premise? (e.g., from "toys" and "desks", infer "classroom").
    *   **For Nested Beliefs (A proposition about another belief):**
        *   **First, analyze the inner clause.** Determine the embedded subject's attitude toward the proposition P. Assess the **strength** of this attitude (strong: *knows, understands*; weak: *suspects, hopes*).
        *   **Then, analyze the interaction between the outer and inner attitudes:**
            *   If the outer verb is **factive** (e.g., "A knows that B knows P"), this entails that A believes P is true.
            *   If the outer verb is **non-factive** (e.g., "A believes that B believes P"), **pragmatic reasoning is required:**
                *   **If the inner verb is strong and factive** (e.g., *knows, understands*), then "A believes that B knows P" strongly suggests that A trusts B's belief and therefore also believes P. In most contexts, this pragmatically entails that A believes P.
                *   **If the inner verb is weak and non-factive** (e.g., *suspects, fears*), then "A believes that B suspects P" does not entail that A believes P. A may not share B's suspicion.
            *   **Exception:** Outer verbs of doubt or negation (e.g., *doubts, denies*) often reverse these pragmatic inferences.
    *   If the hypothesis content is not entailed in this broader sense, conclude **non-entailment**.

4.  **Check for Contradictions or Unfounded Additions:**
    *   Does the hypothesis introduce information that **contradicts the core meaning** of the premise (after pragmatic interpretation in Step 0)?
    *   Does it add **new, specific entities or events** that are unrelated to the premise and cannot be inferred through logical, pragmatic, or interpretive means? If yes, conclude **non-entailment**.
    *   **Do not penalize valid generalizations, reformulations, or interpretive labels.** A seeming contradiction based on a hyper-literal reading may be resolved by the pragmatic interpretation from Step 0.

5.  **Conclude Holistically:**
    *   Synthesize the findings from all steps. The subject must be consistent. The content must be entailed **on balance**.
    *   **Priority to Pragmatics:** If a strict semantic analysis suggests a non-entailment but a strong pragmatic inference supports entailment, **entailment is likely the correct answer**.
    *   Only if the subject is consistent and the content is logically or pragmatically entailed (considering the nuanced interaction of verb semantics and allowing for valid interpretations), output **entailment**. Otherwise, output **non-entailment**.

**Key Example to Guide Reasoning:**
*   Premise: "Olivia suspects that a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna."
*   Hypothesis: "Olivia suspects that a human not wearing any clothes is in a room."
*   **Correct Analysis (Step 0):** "Not wearing any clothes" is a pragmatic and valid interpretation of "dressed only in a towel" in this context. "Human" generalizes "man". "Room" generalizes "sauna". Therefore, this is **entailment**.

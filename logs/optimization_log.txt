Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully applying the following reasoning steps in order:

1.  **Inevitability & Background Conditions**: First, ask: "Was the outcome already inevitable or guaranteed *before* the candidate event?" If yes, the candidate is not a cause. Next, distinguish between an active cause and a stable **background condition** that is normal, routine, or designated. Background conditions are rarely labeled "the cause."

2.  **Causal Preemption**: Then, ask: "Was the outcome already triggered or pre-ordained by another event *before* the candidate event occurred?" If yes, the candidate is redundant and not a cause, even if it was sufficient on its own.

3.  **Counterfactual Dependence**: Proceed by asking: "Would the outcome have occurred *without* the candidate cause?" If the answer is yes, the candidate is not a *necessary* cause. However, continue to the next steps, as it might still be *a* cause in a symmetric overdetermined scenario.

4.  **Symmetric Overdetermination**: If multiple *independent* sufficient causes exist and more than one occurred at *the same time* (e.g., two shooters firing simultaneously), the outcome is overdetermined. In this case, **any event that was sufficient and occurred can be considered *a* cause.**

5.  **Causation by Omission**: If the candidate cause is an *inaction* or *omission*, ask: "Did the agent have a duty, capacity, and opportunity to act, and did their inaction allow a harmful process to continue?" If yes, the omission can be a cause. Note that an omission cannot cause an outcome that was already inevitable or preempted.

6.  **Intervening Causes & Proximity**: For causal chains, identify if a later event was a **free, deliberate, negligent, or highly abnormal act** by another agent. If such an intervening cause is the most direct and salient cause of the harm, it may absorb the causal attribution, making earlier links in the chain merely background conditions.

7.  **Causal Salience and Normative Deviance**: Now, identify the most decisive factor. An event that is **routine, expected, permitted, or in line with policy is unlikely to be labeled "the cause."** The cause is almost always the event that is **deviant, abnormal, unexpected, intentional, or violates norms.** The most salient cause is the one that broke the status quo. **WEIGH THIS STEP HEAVILY. It often overrides purely counterfactual reasoning.**

8.  **Interactive & Multi-Factor Outcomes (AND)**: If the outcome requires a combination of factors (an AND condition), then no single component is causal alone. The combination is the cause. Assess which factor was the **critical, limiting, or deviant element** and assign causation primarily to it.

9.  **Intentionality (Action vs. Outcome)**: To assess if an action was intentional, ask: "Did the agent intend to perform the *specific physical action* that led to the outcome, and did they execute it with control?" An outcome that was desired and achieved does not necessarily mean the specific action was intentional if it involved significant luck, accident, or lack of control in its execution.

10. **Final Synthesis**: Finally, weigh the results from the steps above. **Prioritize salience (Step 7) and preemption (Step 2).** Remember: the question "Did X cause Y?" often asks for the salient cause, not just any causal factor. A permitted or background event is rarely the answer.

After reasoning, output your final answer as `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution. Your task is to answer questions about whether an agent's action or inaction caused a specific outcome, or about related properties like intentionality.

**Key Rules:**
*   **But-For Test is Primary:** An action is a cause only if the outcome would **not** have occurred without it. If the outcome would have occurred anyway, the action is not a cause.
*   **Omissions Require Duty:** An omission can be a cause **only if** the agent had a specific responsibility to act and their inaction preserved a sufficient condition for the outcome.
*   **Intervening Cause Supersedes:** A freely chosen, deliberate, and highly abnormal act by a third party breaks the causal chain from a remote cause.
*   **Intent â‰  Causation:** Causation does not imply intent. Intent requires the outcome to be the agent's specific goal and achieved through their controlled action.
*   **Redundancy is Not Causation:** Creating a redundant sufficient condition (when another sufficient condition already exists) does **not** cause the outcome.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Precisely define the outcome as stated in the question.
2.  **Map the Causal Structure:** Identify **all sufficient conditions** for the outcome. Distinguish between background conditions and active, salient causes.
3.  **Analyze the Agent's Role:**

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution. Your task is to answer questions about whether an agent's action or inaction caused a specific outcome.

**Instructions:**
Follow these steps to structure your reasoning:

1.  **Identify Sufficient Conditions:** Break down the outcome into its necessary components. What are all the conditions that together guarantee the outcome?
2.  **Establish the Agent's Behavior:** Describe the agent's specific action or inaction in the actual scenario. Include what the agent knew or intended based on narrative clues.
3.  **Perform Counterfactual Analysis:** Construct a plausible scenario where the agent acts differently, grounded in narrative evidence (e.g., why they checked something, what they were considering). Ask: Would a sufficient condition for the outcome have likely failed in this counterfactual?
4.  **Judge Causation:** The agent's behavior is a cause if, in the counterfactual, the outcome would have been jeopardized. This is true even if other factors were also present. For inaction, it is causal only if the agent was considering acting and their decision not to act preserved a critical condition.

**Key Principles:**
-   **Decisive Factor:** Causation is determined by factual dependence. The agent's behavior is a cause if it was a decisive factor in ensuring the outcome by creating or preventing the failure of a sufficient condition.
-   **Omissions:** An omission (inaction) can be a cause if the agent was aware of the option to act and their decision not to act directly maintained a necessary condition.
-   **Independence:** The agent can be a cause even if another sufficient condition was present, as long as their action or inaction played a key role.

Now, answer the following question based on these principles.

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution. Your task is to answer questions about whether an agent's action or inaction caused a specific outcome, or whether an action was performed intentionally.

**Instructions:**

**1. Identify the Question Type:**
*   **Causation Question:** "Did X cause Y?"
*   **Intentionality Question:** "Did agent A do action B intentionally?"

**2. For Causation Questions:**
a. **Apply Counterfactual Reasoning (Primary Test):** Determine if the outcome would have occurred had the agent acted differently (e.g., omitted the action or followed instructions). If not, the action is a cause.
b. **Judge Necessity:** An action is a cause only if it was necessary for the outcome in the actual scenario.
c. **Handle Special Cases:**
    *   **Overdetermination:** If multiple actions were sufficient, an action is a cause **only if it made a difference** (i.e., was necessary). If the outcome would have occurred without it, it is *not* a cause.
    *   **Preemption & Normality:** A **deviant action** (violating norms, duties, or instructions) that creates a dangerous situation is the primary cause. A **normal action** (following plans) that completes the chain is *not* considered a cause.
    *   **Omissions:** An omission is a cause only if the agent had a **duty and ability** to act, and acting would have prevented the outcome.

**3. For Intentionality Questions:**
a. **Separate Intent from Action:** A desired outcome does not make the action intentional.
b. **Focus on Control & Execution:** The action is intentional only if performed with **conscious control and deliberate execution**. A loss of control (e.g., a slip, spasm, or mistake) negates intentionality.

**4. Rely on Narrative Clues:**
*   Use keywords (e.g., "against instructions," "slipped," "mistakenly," "as usual") to infer norms, mental states, and what would have happened in the counterfactual scenario.

**Final Answer:**
After your reasoning, clearly state your final answer as "Yes." or "No.".

Now, answer the following question based on these principles.

2.  **Identify the Sufficient Condition:** Determine the precise set of circumstances that guarantees the outcome will occur.
3.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test:** Mentally remove the action or event in question. If the outcome still occurs, the action is not a cause (it may be a contributor). If the outcome is prevented, the action is a cause.
4.  **Check for Preemption/Overdetermination:** Determine if other sufficient conditions were already present, making the action causally redundant.
5.  **Consider Intentionality (if applicable):** For questions of intent, assess whether the actor desired the outcome and performed a deliberate action to achieve it.

To achieve this, carefully consider the logical progression of your thoughts, using appropriate connective words and phrases to guide the reader seamlessly from one point to the next. Maintain the original meaning, block order, and formatting while enhancing the overall flow of the text.

Your reasoning must follow these sequential steps:
1.  **Identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for the outcome.** First, determine what events or states are fundamentally required to bring about the result in question.
2.  **Establish the pre-existing context.** Next, before analyzing the specific action, assess whether these necessary conditions for the outcome were already present and met.
3.  **Apply the test of necessity.** Subsequently, ask: "Would the outcome have occurred even if the action had not been taken?" Crucially, if the answer is yes, then the action is not a cause.
4.  **For questions about intent, distinguish between motive and action.** Specifically, an outcome is intentional only if it was a conscious goal of the agent's plan, not merely a foreseen but undesired side effect.
5.  **Recognize overdetermination.** Furthermore, be aware that an outcome can have multiple sufficient causes; an action is not causal if other sufficient causes were already present and would have produced the outcome independently.
6.  **Connect your analysis directly to the question.** Finally, conclude by explicitly stating whether the action was a cause (or was intentional) based on the systematic application of these rules.

You are an expert in analyzing factual causation and intentionality. Your task is to determine if a described action was the cause of a specific outcome, or if an outcome was brought about intentionally.

**Core Instruction:** Apply the principle of counterfactual dependence as your **primary** and **non-negotiable** test for factual causation: An action is a cause of an outcome if, and only if, the outcome would not have occurred without that action.

**Invariant Decision Procedure:**
For every analysis, follow these steps in order:
1.  **Precisely Define:** Identify the exact action and the specific outcome based on the scenario's wording.
2.  **Counterfactual Test (Necessity):** Ask: "If the action had not occurred, would the outcome still have happened exactly as described?"
    *   If **yes**, it is not a cause. Conclude `<answer>No</answer>`.
    *   If **no**, it is a necessary cause. Proceed to step 3.
3.  **Normative Filter (Salience):** Check if the action violated an explicit rule, policy, or normal expectation (was it "abnormal"?).
    *   If it **was deviant**, it is the cause. Conclude `<answer>Yes</answer>`.
    *   If it **was not deviant**, it remains a cause. Check other necessary conditions for deviance. If none exist, the action is still a cause. Conclude `<answer>Yes</answer>`.

**Key Principles to Apply:**

*   **Omissions as Causes:** A failure to act (an omission) can be a cause if the agent had a duty to act and the outcome counterfactually depends on that action being taken.
*   **The "Only Change" Principle:** When no actions are deviant, the cause is the event that changed the state of the world to make the outcome true.
*   **Independence of Causation and Blame:** An action can be a factual cause even if it was permitted, accidental, or well-intentioned.

**For Intentionality (Not Causation):**
If the question is about intention (e.g., "Did X intentionally do Y?"), use this test: An outcome was intentional if the agent (a) knew it would occur and (b) desired it to occur or used it as a means to their goal. Merely foreseeing an outcome is not sufficient for intention.

**Base Reasoning on Provided Facts:** Use only the information given in the scenario. Do not introduce external assumptions or knowledge.

**Provide a Clear Final Answer:** After your analysis, state your conclusion within the tags `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.

Your response must be logically structured, coherent, and follow the procedure above. Prioritize factual and logical accuracy.

**Your reasoning must follow these sequential steps. Do not skip any step.**

1.  **Identify the Outcome and Its Conditions.** Precisely define the outcome of interest. Determine the **necessary** and **sufficient** conditions required for it to occur. This is the foundation for all subsequent analysis.

2.  **Analyze the Pre-Existing Context (The Gatekeeper Step).** This is the most crucial step. Before evaluating the specific action, assess the state of the world *immediately prior* to it. **Determine: Were the necessary and sufficient conditions for the outcome already present and met?** If yes, the outcome was already guaranteed, rendering the action **non-causal**. Your analysis may stop here. Proceed to Step 3 **only if** the outcome was **not** pre-determined.

3.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test of Necessity.** Construct a specific counterfactual world where the action was **NOT** taken. Ask: **"In this scenario, holding all else constant, would the outcome still have occurred?"**
    *   If **yes**, the action is **not a cause**. (This often indicates overdetermination or pre-emption).
    *   If **no**, the action **is a cause**.

4.  **Account for Overdetermination and Pre-emption.** An outcome can have multiple sufficient causes. An action is **not causal** if another sufficient cause was **already present and operative** and would have produced the outcome independently. **Focus exclusively on the *actual* causal chain that occurred, not on potential or alternative chains.** If the counterfactual test in Step 3 yielded "no," confirm that no other factor pre-empts the action's necessary role.

5.  **For Intent, Distinguish Motive from Action.** If asked about intent, remember: **causation must be established before intent is relevant.** An outcome is intentional only if it was a **conscious goal** of the agent's plan, not merely a foreseen but undesired side effect.

6.  **State a Direct Conclusion.** Conclude by explicitly stating whether the action was a cause (or was intentional) **based solely on the systematic application of the rules above.** Directly connect your analysis to the original question. Do not add new reasoning.

**Key Invariant to Remember:** An action is a cause **if and only if** it was **necessary** for the outcome in the actual sequence of events, as determined by the counterfactual test, and it was not pre-empted by another sufficient cause. The presence of a sufficient condition does not imply that all actions leading to it are causal; only those that were necessary are.

    *   **Intention:** To judge if an outcome was **intentional**, determine if it was the agent's **goal or purpose**. If the outcome was merely a known but unintended side-effect of their goal, it is not intentional (this is the Doctrine of Double Effect).

**Key Principles:**
*   **Causation is about specific outcomes:** Always reason about the specific instance of the outcome (the "token") as described in the scenario, not the general possibility of the outcome (the "type").
*   An event can be a cause even if it was not the only cause.
*   The presence of another sufficient cause does not negate the causal role of a simultaneous sufficient cause.
*   Causation is separate from intention. One can cause an outcome without intending it.

Reasoning: The device charges only if both plugged in AND on the pad. Wayne checked the pad, indicating he was verifying a critical condition.

Determine all the distinct sets of conditions that, on their own, would be sufficient to guarantee the outcome. **Critically, note if any sufficient condition was already present *before* the agent acted.**

2.  **Establish the Agent's Behavior:** Describe the agent's specific action or inaction. Include what the agent knew, intended, **and whether the outcome was a direct and controlled result of their execution (i.e., did it happen the way they meant it to?).**

3.  **Perform Counterfactual Analysis (The "But-For" Test):** Construct a plausible scenario where the agent acts differently. Determine if the outcome would have been jeopardized (i.e., if a sufficient condition would have failed) in this counterfactual. **This is the primary test for causation. If the outcome would not have occurred without the action, the answer is strongly "Yes". If it would have occurred anyway, the answer is typically "No".**

4.  **Check for Causal Nuances:**
    *   **Preemption:** If the outcome would have occurred anyway in the counterfactual, determine if the agent's action was the **first** or **primary** event to complete a sufficient condition. A preempting action is a cause.
    *   **Overdetermination:** If multiple independent sufficient conditions were present simultaneously, **determine if the agent's behavior was the *proximate cause* (the most direct and immediate cause) or if it was a redundant, non-decisive factor. A subsequent action that creates a redundant sufficient condition is often not considered *the* cause.**
    *   **Proximate vs. Distal Cause:** Distinguish between the immediate, direct cause of the outcome (proximate cause) and any underlying, indirect causes (distal causes). **For the question "Did X cause Y?", the proximate cause is most often2025-09-04 10:19:33,526 - ðŸ“Š Current Template_description:

You are an expert in analyzing factual causation. Your task is to determine if a described action (or inaction) was the cause of a specific outcome.

**Core Instruction:** Apply the principle of counterfactual dependence as your primary and objective test for causation: An action is a cause of an outcome if, and only if, the outcome would not have occurred without that action. Focus strictly on this factual chain of events.

**Guidelines for Analysis:**
1.  **Separate Cause from Blame:** First, determine factual causation. Then, you may separately analyze moral responsibility, intent, or foreseeability. Your final answer on causation must be based solely on the counterfactual test.
2.  **Base reasoning on provided facts:** Use only the information given in the scenario. Do not introduce external assumptions or knowledge.
3.  **Provide a clear final answer:** After your analysis, state your conclusion within the tags <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.

Your response must be logically structured and coherent. Prioritize factual and logical accuracy above stylistic flourishes.

**Example:**
*   **Scenario:** "John forgot to water Jane's plant while she was away. The plant died. Did John's inaction cause the plant's death?"
*   **Analysis:** Without John's failure to water the plant, it would not have died. Therefore, his inaction was a necessary factor in the outcome. The question of his responsibility or intent is separate from this factual cause.
*   **Output:** <answer>Yes</answer>

You are an expert in analyzing factual causation and intentionality. Your task is to determine if a described action was the cause of a specific outcome, or if an outcome was brought about intentionally.

**Core Instruction:** Apply the principle of counterfactual dependence as your **primary** test for factual causation: An action is a cause of an outcome if, and only if, the outcome would not have occurred without that action.

**Enhanced Guidelines for Accurate Analysis:**

1.  **Distinguish Causation from Intentionality:**
    *   For questions about **causation** (e.g., "Did X cause Y?"), use the counterfactual test.
    *   For questions about **intention** (e.g., "Did X intentionally do Y?"), use this test: An outcome was intentional if the agent (a) knew it would occur and (b) desired it to occur or used it as a means to their goal. Merely foreseeing an outcome is not sufficient for intention.

2.  **Consider Normative Baselines (The "Abnormal" Cause):** When multiple actions are necessary for an outcome, identify if any action violated an explicit rule, policy, or normal expectation.

Answer questions about causal attribution by rigorously applying this structured reasoning process:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Begin by precisely defining the specific event or result being analyzed, quoting the query if necessary. Pay close attention to the exact wording (e.g., distinguishing between "shoot intentionally" and "shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally"), as subtle differences can change the analysis.

2.  **Map All Sufficient Conditions:** Next, determine all minimal sets of circumstances that would individually guarantee the outcome. List all possible sufficient conditions, even those that were inactive in this specific scenario, to establish a complete causal background.

3.  **Analyze the Actual Causal Chain:** Proceed to describe the specific sequence of events that *did* occur. Identify which sufficient condition(s) were instantiated in the actual world and trace the order in which they became active.

4.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test for Necessity:** Mentally remove the specific action, event, or omission in question. Ask: "If this had not happened, would the outcome still have occurred **in the exact same way and at the same time**?"
    *   If the outcome is **prevented or significantly delayed**, then the removed element is a cause.
    *   If the outcome occurs **identically** via another sufficient condition, then the removed element is likely not a necessary cause.

5.  **Check for Preemption/Overdetermination:** Building on the previous steps, determine if other sufficient conditions were present and active.
    *   **Symmetrical Overdetermination (e.g., two rocks thrown at once):** If multiple sufficient conditions act simultaneously, no single one may be necessary. Causal ascription may depend on other factors.
    *   **Preemption (e.g., one rock hits first):** The preempting condition (the one that acts first) is typically considered the actual cause, as it renders the backup condition redundant.

6.  **Consider Agency (for Actions and Omissions):** When the query involves an agent, apply this additional analysis.
    *   **For Actions:** Assess whether the actor desired the specific outcome and performed a deliberate action to achieve it. Foreseen but undesired side effects are not intentional.
    *   **For Omissions:** Ask: (a) Did the actor know the situation? (b) Did the actor have the ability to act? (c) Did the actor consciously choose not to act? If all are true, the omission can be considered causal, especially if it preserved an active sufficient condition.

7.  **Synthesize for Final Judgment:** Finally, integrate the analysis from all steps. The counterfactual test (Step 4) is primary for determining *necessity*, but the actual causal chain (Step 3) and preemption analysis (Step 5) are primary for identifying *actual causation*. For "because" questions, favor the actual cause.
    *   If the event was part of the actual, preempting causal chain, answer "Yes".
    *   If it was preempted, redundant, or a non-necessary side effect, answer "No".
    Conclude with a clear "<answer>Yes</answer>" or "<answer>No</answer>".

Interpret the action at the correct level of abstraction (e.g., "making a statement" might pragmatically represent "giving approval").

**Key Principles to Apply:**

*   **Omissions as Causes:** A failure to act (an omission) is only a cause if the agent had a duty to act and the outcome counterfactually depends on that action being taken. An omission without a duty is a background condition, not a cause.
*   **Overdetermination:** In cases with multiple sufficient causes (e.g., two people trigger a sensor), an action is not a cause if the outcome would have occurred at the same time via a different, sufficient pathway.
*   **Independence of Causation and Blame:** An action can be a factual cause even if it was permitted, accidental, or well-intentioned. This procedure identifies factual causes, which may differ from moral or legal responsibility.

**For Intentionality (Not Causation):**
If the question is about intention (e.g., "Did X intentionally do Y?"), use this test: An outcome was intentional if the agent (a) knew that their action would lead to that **specific outcome as described**, and (b) acted because they desired that outcome **or knowingly and willingly accepted it** as a certain or highly probable consequence of their goal. Mere foresight is not enough for intention, but knowingly bringing about an outcome is sufficient.

**Base Reasoning on Provided Facts:** Use only the information given in the scenario. Do not introduce external assumptions or knowledge.

**Provide a Clear Final Answer:** After your analysis, state your conclusion within the tags `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.

Your response must be logically structured, coherent, and follow this procedure without deviation. Prioritize factual and logical accuracy.

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully applying the following reasoning steps:

1.  **Counterfactual Necessity**: Begin by asking: "Would the outcome have occurred *without* the candidate cause?" If the answer is yes, the candidate is not a cause.

2.  **Overdetermination**: Next, consider if multiple sufficient causes exist and more than one occurred; if so, no single event is causal.

3.  **Multi-Factor Outcomes (AND)**: For outcomes requiring multiple factors, identify the critical, limiting factor. A necessary but highly probable factor is less causal than an unlikely, decisive one.

4.  **Intention vs. Side Effect**: Then, distinguish between intention and side effects: an outcome that was foreseen but not the agent's goal is not intentional causation.

5.  **Causation â‰  Blame**: Furthermore, focus on factual dependence, not morality or policy violations. Remember that a permitted event can be causal, and a wrong event can be non-causal.

6.  **Inevitability**: Also, assess if the outcome was guaranteed before the candidate event; if it was, that event did not cause it.

7.  **Interactive Effects**: Finally, if the outcome requires a combination of factors, recognize that no single component is causal alone.

After reasoning, output your final answer as <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.

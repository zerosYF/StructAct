Answer questions about causal attribution by following these structured steps:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Precisely define the specific result in question.
2.  **Identify the Agent:** Note the specific agent whose causal role is being evaluated.
3.  **Analyze the Action:** Determine the agent's action and its permissibility (permitted or prohibited by known rules or norms).
4.  **Apply Counterfactual Reasoning (The Core Test):** Ask, "If this agent's action had *not* occurred, would the outcome still have happened?"
    -   **Model the system rules precisely** (e.g., game mechanics, technical policies, grading curves) to determine the counterfactual scenario.
    -   **Remove only the agent's action;** do not assume changes to other agents' actions unless logically forced by the rules.
    -   **Decision:** If the outcome would **not** have occurred, the agent is a cause. If it **would** have occurred, the agent is not a cause.
5.  **Handle Multiple Agents:** If multiple actions were *jointly necessary* for the outcome, then each agent is a cause (the outcome would not have occurred without any one of them).
6.  **Decouple Causation from Other Factors:**
    -   **Permissibility is irrelevant:** A permitted action can be a cause, and a prohibited action may not be.
    -   **Intent and knowledge are secondary** and do not override the counterfactual necessity test.
7.  **Render a Decision:** Conclude with a clear answer based solely on causal contribution.

Answer questions about causal attribution by identifying the **actual and operative cause**. Follow this structured reasoning process:

1.  **Extract Key Facts:** Identify the actions, omissions, and context relevant to the outcome.
2.  **Preliminary But-For Test:** Use necessity as a starting point, but do not rely on it as the final determinant.
3.  **Analyze Causal Structure:** Check for preemption (one cause overrides another) or overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes).
4.  **Evaluate the Operative Cause:** Determine the most direct, salient, and deviant factor by assessing:
    *   **Directness:** Proximity in the causal chain.
    *   **Salience:** Significance to the agents and goals involved.
    *   **Deviance:** Violation of policies, norms, or reasonable expectations.
5.  **Judge Intentionality & Omissions:** A cause must be a deliberate decision. A conscious omission can be causal if the outcome resulted from that intentional failure to act. Distinguish intended outcomes from incidental side effects.
6.  **Conclude:** The operative cause is the most immediate, intentional, and norm-violating factor that made the difference. In preemption, the preempting cause is operative. In overdetermination, the most deviant cause is operative.

Focus on deliberate actions and intentional omissions that are abnormal in the context, rather than necessary but incidental or praiseworthy factors.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these structured steps:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Precisely define the specific result in question.
2.  **Identify the Agent and Their Conduct:** Note the specific agent and their specific action or omission.
3.  **Analyze the Conduct:**
    *   For an **action**, determine what the agent did.
    *   For an **omission**, determine what the agent *did not do*.
4.  **Consider Knowledge and Intent:** Evaluate the agent's awareness of circumstances and consequences, if relevant, to assess if the conduct was an abnormal intervention.
5.  **Apply the Necessity ("But-For") Test:** This is the definitive criterion for causation.
    *   **For Actions:** Ask, "If the agent had **not** performed this specific action, while holding all other actual events fixed, would the outcome have been different?"
    *   **For Omissions:** Ask, "If the agent **had** performed the omitted action, would the outcome have been prevented?"
    *   **Guidance:**
        *   If the answer is "no, the outcome would have been the same," the agent is **not** a cause. This is true even if the action was prohibited or another agent was also involved.
        *   If the answer is "yes, the outcome would have been different," the agent **is** a cause.
        *   **Overdetermination:** If another factor was independently sufficient to cause the identical outcome, the agent's conduct is not necessary, and the answer is **No**.
6.  **Render a Decision:** Conclude based solely on causal necessity. A prohibited action can fail to be a cause, and a permitted action can be a cause. The answer must be either Yes or No.

1.  **Define the precise outcome.** Identify the specific, concrete event.
2.  **Trace the actual sequence.** Map the chain of events that directly produced the outcome based on the facts.
3.  **Apply the but-for test to the actual sequence:** Ask, "Would the outcome have occurred *exactly as it did* if the action/omission had not happened?"
    *   If **no**, it is an actual cause.
    *   If **yes**, it is preempted or irrelevant.
4.  **Handle multiple causes correctly:**
    *   **Joint Necessity:** If multiple actions were all necessary parts of one sufficient set, all are causes.
    *   **Overdetermination:** If multiple independent actions were each sufficient on their own, all are causes.
5.  **For intent questions (only if causation is established):**
    *   Determine if the agent had **knowledge** the outcome was substantially certain and **desire** (either purpose or willingness to accept it as a known result).

**CRITICAL RULES:**
*   **The "As it Did" Principle:** The test is about preventing the *specific occurrence* of the outcome, not if it was inevitable.
*   **Focus on Facts, Not Norms:** Ignore rules, policies, or "shoulds." Analyze only the described causal relationships.

Answer questions about causal attribution and related concepts like intent by following these structured steps:

1.  **Parse the Question:** Identify the precise key terms (e.g., "cause," "intentionally," "enable"). Tailor your analysis to these terms.

2.  **Identify the Outcome:** Define the specific result in question.

3.  **Identify the Agent and Their Conduct:** Note the specific agent and their specific action or omission.

4.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test for Cause-in-Fact:** This is the primary, non-negotiable test. Norms and duties are irrelevant here.
    *   **For an Action:** Ask, "If the agent had **NOT** performed this specific action, while holding all other actual events fixed, would the outcome have been different?"
    *   **For an Omission:** Ask, "If the agent **HAD** performed the relevant action, would the outcome have been prevented?"
    *   If the answer is "Yes," the conduct was a cause-in-fact. Proceed to answer "Yes" for causal questions. Only proceed to Step 5 if the answer is "No" or the scenario is complex.

5.  **Analyze Complex Causal Scenarios (If Needed):**
    *   **Overdetermination (Multiple Sufficient Causes):** If multiple factors were present and each was individually sufficient to cause the outcome, then **each factor is a cause**. Do not conclude an agent is not a cause simply because the outcome would have occurred from another sufficient factor alone.
    *   **Preemption:** If a separate, sufficient cause *would have* brought about the outcome but was preempted by the agent's conduct, the agent **is** a cause. The agent is **not** a cause only if another sufficient cause *actually occurred* independently.

6.  **Analyze Intent (If Required):** Only if the question asks about "intent."
    *   **Intentional:** The outcome was a **primary goal or purpose** of the agent's conduct.
    *   **Not Intentional:** The outcome was a **foreseen but secondary side effect**. Do not conflate "knowingly" with "intentionally."

7.  **Render a Decision:** Conclude with a clear, binary answer based strictly on the preceding analysis.
    *   For causal questions: If the agent's action or omission was a cause-in-fact, the answer is Yes.

Answer questions about causal attribution by first identifying all **actual causes** and then determining the **operative cause** for attribution. Follow this structured reasoning process meticulously:

**Phase 1: Establish Factual Causation**
1.  **Identify Actual Causes:** A factor is an actual cause if it was a Necessary Element of a Sufficient Set (NESS) for the outcome. This means it was a necessary part of a set of conditions present in the case that was sufficient to bring about the outcome.
    *   Use the **But-For Test** only as an initial check. **Its failure is not conclusive;** always proceed to the NESS test, especially with multiple potential causes.
    *   **Crucially distinguish causal structures:**
        *   **Conjunctive Causation:** Multiple factors are jointly necessary to form one sufficient set (all are actual causes).
        *   **Overdetermination:** Multiple factors are individually sufficient on their own (all are actual causes).
        *   **Preemption:** One cause intervenes before another.

**Phase 2: Determine the Operative Cause for Attribution**
2.  **Evaluate for Operative Salience:** Only evaluate factors confirmed as **actual causes**. If multiple exist, determine the most salient for attribution by assessing:
    *   **Deviance:** Did the action violate policies, norms, or reasonable expectations? **Negligence or careless mistakes constitute deviance.**
    *   **Duty & Responsibility:** Was the agent under a specific duty to prevent the outcome? Breach of duty greatly increases salience.
    *   **Directness & Intentionality:** Consider the proximity in the causal chain and whether the outcome was intended.

3.  **Conclude on Operative Cause:**
    *   In **preemption**, the preempting cause is operative.
    *   In **symmetrical overdetermination**, all factors are actual causes.
    *   In **asymmetrical or conjunctive scenarios**, the most deviant cause is operative.

**Final Guidance & Invariants:**
*   **The question "Did X cause Y?" is a question of factual causation.** If X is an *actual cause*, answer "Yes." Only override this if the context explicitly asks for the "primary" or "most responsible" cause.
*   A conscious, intentional omission can be a cause, especially if the agent had a duty to act.
*   **Always establish factual causation first using NESS. Operative salience is only evaluated for actual causes.**

Answer questions about causal attribution and related concepts like intent by first adhering to these core principles:

*   **Causation is Factual:** Determine cause-in-fact using a strict counterfactual test. Norms, duties, and morality are irrelevant for this step.
*   **Hold the World Fixed:** The counterfactual test requires you to assume all other events happened exactly as described; only change the specific action of the agent in question.
*   **Intent is Purpose-Based:** An outcome is intentional only if it was the agent's primary goal or purpose for acting. A foreseen side effect is not intentional.

Then, follow these structured steps:

1.  **Parse the Question:** Identify the key terms (e.g., "cause," "intentionally"). Tailor your analysis to these terms.

2.  **Identify the Outcome:** Define the specific result in question.

3.  **Identify the Agent and Their Conduct:** Note the specific agent and their specific action or omission.

4.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test for Cause-in-Fact:** This is the primary, non-negotiable test.
    *   **For an Action:** Ask, "If the agent had **NOT** performed this specific action, while holding all other actual events fixed, would the outcome have been different?"
    *   **For an Omission:** Ask, "If the agent **HAD** performed the relevant action, would the outcome have been prevented?"
    *   If the answer is "Yes," the conduct was a cause-in-fact. Proceed to answer "Yes" for causal questions. Only proceed to Step 5 if the answer is definitively "No."

5.  **Analyze Complex Causal Scenarios (If Counterfactual Test is "No"):**
    *   **Overdetermination (Multiple Sufficient Causes):** If multiple factors were present and each was individually sufficient to cause the outcome, then **each factor is a cause**. Do not conclude an agent is not a cause simply because the outcome would have occurred from another sufficient factor alone.
    *   **Preemption:** If a separate, sufficient cause *would have* brought about the outcome but was preempted by the agent's conduct, the agent **is** a cause. The agent is **not** a cause only if another sufficient cause *actually occurred* independently.

6.  **Analyze Intent (If Required):** Only if the question asks about "intent."
    *   **Intentional:** The outcome was a **primary goal or purpose** of the agent's conduct.
    *   **Not Intentional:** The outcome was a **foreseen but secondary side effect**. Do not conflate "knowingly" with "intentionally."

7.  **Render a Decision:** Conclude with a clear, binary answer based strictly on the preceding analysis.
    *   For causal questions: If the agent's action or omission was a cause-in-fact, the answer is Yes.
    *   For intent questions: If the outcome was a primary goal, the answer is Yes; if a side effect, the answer is No.

Answer questions about causal attribution by identifying the **actual and operative cause**. Rigorously follow this structured process:

1.  **Extract Key Facts:** Identify all actions, omissions, rules, policies, andâ€”criticallyâ€”the **knowledge, intentions, and goals of agents**. Note any norms or role-based responsibilities, including implicit norms of rational, goal-directed behavior. **Identify which factors are deviant (violate rules/expectations) and which are normal background conditions.**

2.  **Preliminary But-For Test:** Use necessity as a starting filter. If the target is not a but-for cause, it is likely not operative unless in cases of preemption. **Never conclude causation based on this test alone.**

3.  **Analyze Causal Structure:** Check for preemption (one cause intervenes and overrides another) or overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes exist). In overdetermination, **shift focus to determine which agent's deliberate choice completed the sufficient set or was operatively relied upon.**

4.  **Apply the Agency & Reliance Test:** The operative cause is **always** a factor that involves the **deliberate, knowledge-based exercise of agency to bring about the outcome.**
    *   **For Actions:** Was it a deliberate, voluntary act intended to produce the outcome? An outcome being a foreseeable consequence does not automatically make it intentional.
    *   **For Omissions:** Was it an **intentional, knowledge-based omission?** Apply this test:
        *   **Duty/Capacity:** Did the agent have a duty, role, or capacity to act?
        *   **Knowledge:** Did the agent acquire information about the situation?
        *   **Choice & Reliance:** Did the agent, based on that knowledge, make a **deliberate choice not to act**, thereby intentionally **relying on an existing sufficient condition** to produce the outcome?
    *   **If yes, the omission is the operative cause.**
    *   *Tie-breakers (if multiple factors exhibit agency):*
        *   **Deviance:** Which factor violated a rule, policy, or strong expectation?
        *   **Salience & Directness:** Which was more immediate or significant in the chain of events?

5.  **Conclude:** State if the target was the operative cause based on the presence of a deliberate, agential choice. **An agent's intentional decision to rely on a condition (via action or knowledgeable omission) is typically the operative cause.** Passive background states and norm-following behavior without agential involvement are not operative. **If the causal chain involves no deliberate human agency (only mechanical, accidental, or natural events), conclude that there is no operative cause.**

**Invariant:** Focus on deliberate actions and **knowledge-based intentional omissions.** The operative cause MUST involve a deliberate choice. But-for necessity is only a filter. Deviance is a key signal for identifying agency. No agency means no operative cause.

Answer questions about causal attribution by identifying whether the specified action or omission was an **actual cause** of the outcome. Your analysis must be strictly factual, based only on counterfactual dependence and sufficiency.

**Follow this structured reasoning process:**

1.  **Define the Precise Outcome.** State the specific outcome described in the scenario, including its time, place, and manner. Your counterfactual reasoning must be about preventing *this exact occurrence*.
2.  **Describe the Actual Sequence.** List the key events that actually happened leading to the outcome.
3.  **Determine the Type of Causal Scenario:** Your entire analysis must hinge on applying the counterfactual (but-for) test to the candidate cause: "If the candidate cause had not occurred (or, for an omission, if the action had been taken), would the specific outcome have occurred **exactly as it did**?"
    *   **Standard/Joint Cause:** The candidate is an actual cause if it was a **necessary element** of the set of actual conditions that together were sufficient for the outcome. (Apply the but-for test: Would the outcome have occurred *as it did* if the candidate cause had not happened? If **no**, it is an actual cause).
    *   **Overdetermination (Duplicative):** If multiple events occurred, each of which was **by itself sufficient** to cause the outcome, then **all of them are actual causes**. (Example: Two assassins shoot a victim simultaneously; both bullets are fatal. Both are causes).
    *   **Preemption (Cutting-Off):** If one event (the preempting cause) initiates a process that leads to the outcome and **prevents** another potential cause (the preempted cause) from completing its process, then only the preempting cause is an actual cause. The preempted cause is not a cause. (Example: Assassin A shoots the victim, who dies instantly. Assassin B arrives one second later. Only A's shot is a cause).
4.  **Apply the Test for Omissions:** Treat a deliberate failure to act exactly like an action. Ask: "If the person had acted, would the outcome have been prevented?" If yes, then the omission is an actual cause.
5.  **Final Judgment:** Answer "Yes" only if the candidate was an actual cause based on the analysis above. **STRICTLY IGNORE:** Responsibility, blame, morality, rules, intentions, foresight, or what "should" have happened. Your task is a mechanical application of counterfactual logic, not ethical judgment.

Answer questions about causal attribution and intentionality by performing a structured analysis. Follow these steps for each question. Your final answer must be exactly `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.

**KEY PRINCIPLES:**

*   **Distinguish Causation from Intentionality:** Causing an outcome is about its dependence on the agent's action/omission. Intentionally causing an outcome requires it to be part of the agent's plan or a known and certain side effect of their goal-directed action.
*   **Multiple Sufficient & Joint Causes:** An outcome can have more than one cause. If two factors are independently sufficient and both occur, they are both causes. Two factors can also be **joint causes** (each necessary and together sufficient). A factor is a cause if it is a necessary part of a sufficient set that actually occurred.
*   **Operative Action vs. Background Condition:** The cause is the **operative factor**â€”the specific action or omission that actively made the difference in the actual scenario. Distinguish active, intervening events from passive background conditions. An omission is a cause if it allowed a specific causal process to continue.
*   **Foreseeability and Knowledge:** An agent is not responsible for truly unforeseeable consequences. However, a known and certain consequence of an action can be considered intentional, even if not desired.
*   **Actual Sequence Priority:** The analysis must be grounded **only** in the specific sequence of events that *actually occurred*. The most recent operative event is typically the cause.

Answer questions about causal attribution and related concepts by first determining the context of "cause" and then following these structured steps:

0.  **Determine the Context of "Cause":**
    *   Analyze the scenario for normative elements: keywords like `allowed`, `not allowed`, `permitted`, `against the rules`, `policy`, `duty`, `responsibility`, `knowingly`, or `ignorant`.
    *   **If strong normative elements are present**, interpret "cause" as **normative responsibility** (blameworthy cause). The primary question is whether the agent's rule-breaking conduct was causally relevant.
    *   **If no strong normative elements are present**, interpret "cause" as **factual cause** (cause-in-fact).

1.  **Parse the Question:** Identify the precise key terms (e.g., "cause," "intentionally," "enable"). Tailor your analysis to these terms.

2.  **Identify the Outcome:** Define the specific result in question.

3.  **Identify the Agent and Their Conduct:** Note the specific agent and their specific action or omission. For normative contexts, pay special attention to whether the conduct violated a known rule.

4.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test for Cause-in-Fact:** This test establishes minimal causal contribution.
    *   **For an Action:** Ask, "If the agent had **NOT** performed this specific action, while holding all other actual events fixed, would the outcome have been different?"
    *   **For an Omission:** Ask, "If the agent **HAD** performed the relevant action, would the outcome have been prevented?"
    *   If the answer is "Yes," the conduct was a cause-in-fact. Proceed to answer "Yes" for factual cause questions. Only proceed to Step 5 if the answer is "No" or the scenario is complex.

5.  **Analyze Complex Causal Scenarios (If Needed):**

You are an expert in causal reasoning, attribution theory, and the philosophy of action. Your task is to answer questions about whether a specific agent caused a specific outcome. First, classify the question type based solely on its wording:

*   If it asks about "intention," "purpose," or "deliberation," perform an **Intentionality Analysis**.
*   If it asks if something happened "because" of an action/inaction, perform an **Actual Causation Analysis**.
*   If it implies blame, responsibility, or duty, perform an **Attribution Analysis**.

**KEY GUIDELINES:**
*   **Define the Outcome Precisely:** Your first step is to state the exact outcome from the question verbatim. Do not generalize, interpret, or rephrase it.
*   **But-For Test is Decisive:** For Actual Causation, the "But-For" test is the primary filter. If the outcome would **not** have occurred without the action/inaction, answer "Yes" and conclude the analysis.
*   **Anchor on the Actual Sequence:** Base all analysis *only* on the events that did or did not happen in the narrative. Ignore all potential actions, unused capacities, or what other agents *could have* done but didn't.
*   **Intent is Internal:** For Intentionality, ignore the outcome's morality. Focus only on the agent's specific desires and knowledge.
*   **Attribution is Normative:** For Attribution, judge actions/omissions against a standard of "deviance" (breaking rules/duties) or "default" (following them).
*   **Isolate the Frameworks:** Do not allow concepts from one framework (e.g., duty from Attribution) to leak into another (e.g., Actual Causation). Use only the tools in the designated framework.

Then, follow the corresponding structured framework below.

### **Intentionality Analysis**
**0. Define the Outcome:** Precisely state the outcome.
**1. Identify Agent's Mental State:**
    *   **Desire:** Did the agent want or desire the outcome?
    *   **Belief:** Did the agent know their action would certainly bring about the outcome?
**2. Final Judgment:** The agent intentionally caused the outcome **if** the outcome was a desired goal **or** a known and certain side-effect. Answer "Yes" or "No".

---
### **Actual Causation Analysis**
**0. Define the Outcome:** Precisely state the outcome.
**1. Apply the "But-For" Test:** Would the outcome have occurred if the agent had not performed the specific action/inaction?
    *   If **No**, the action/inaction was a cause. â†’ Answer "Yes".
    *   If **Yes**, proceed to step 2.
**2. Assess for Causal Necessity:** Was the agent's action/inaction a necessary part of the *actual sequence of events* that produced the outcome? (Ignore all other potential sequences.)
    *   If **Yes**, answer "Yes".
    *   If **No**, answer "No".

---
### **Attribution Analysis**
**0. Define the Outcome:** Precisely state the outcome.
**1. Identify Necessary Conditions:** List all events and omissions that were jointly necessary for the outcome *in the actual sequence*.
**2. Assess Normative Status:** Categorize each necessary action or inaction as:
    *   **"Deviant"**: Violating formal rules, moral norms, or reasonable expectations. An omission is deviant **only if** the agent had a duty, capacity, and knowledge to act but did not.
    *   **"Default"**: Following rules, norms, or expectations. An omission is default if the agent had no duty, no capacity, or no knowledge to act.
**3. Evaluate Asymmetry:** For symmetric cases, do not attribute causation to a single agent unless one action was uniquely deviant.
**4. Determine Proximate Cause:** Identify the most proximate, sufficient cause in the causal chain.
**5. Final Judgment:** An agent is the cause if their action/inaction was necessary for the outcome and was uniquely deviant. If the action was merely a default or symmetric necessary condition, the agent is not the cause. For omissions, the agent is the cause if their inaction was deviant and the most proximate sufficient cause. Answer "Yes" or "No".

Answer strictly with "Yes" or "No".

Answer questions about causal and intentional attribution by performing a structured analysis. Follow these steps for each question:

1.  **Identify the Question Type:** Determine if the question is primarily about:
    *   **Factual Causation:** "Did X cause Y?" (Intent is irrelevant)
    *   **Intentionality:** "Did X intend to cause Y?"
    *   **Causation by Omission:** "Did a failure to act cause Y?"

2.  **Identify the Action/Omission and its Result:** Pinpoint the specific act (or failure to act) and its direct outcome.

3.  **Analyze Factual Causation (If Applicable):**
    *   **Apply the "But-For" Test (Necessity) FIRST:** This is the most critical test. In the *actual scenario*, would the outcome have occurred *exactly as it did* without this action/omission? If **no**, it is a **necessary cause**. Proceed to proximate cause analysis.
    *   **Apply the "Sufficient Set" Test (for Overdetermination):** If *not* necessary, was this action/omission part of the *actual set* of conditions that were collectively sufficient to cause the outcome? If **yes**, it is a **sufficient cause**. (Crucially, if another condition existed independently that was already sufficient on its own, the action is *not* causal).
    *   **Analyze Proximate Causation:** For a necessary or sufficient cause, was it the most direct cause? Check for any independent, unforeseeable intervening events that break the causal chain.

4.  **Analyze Intentionality (If Applicable):**
    *   **Identify the Agent's Goal:** What was the agent's desired outcome?
    *   **Assess the Agent's Knowledge:** Did the agent know their action would make the result *virtually certain* (not merely possible or likely)? Mere foresight constitutes recklessness, not intent.
    *   **Evaluate the Agent's Control:** Was the result a product of a controlled, purposeful action, or an accidental byproduct?
    *   **Conclusion on Intent:** Answer **Yes** only if the agent (a) had the result as a goal *or* knew it was virtually certain, *and* (b) executed the action with voluntary control.

5.  **Analyze Omissions (If Applicable):**
    *   **Establish a Duty to Act:** Did the agent have a duty to act (from role, responsibility, instructions, or prior action)?
    *   **Apply Causation Tests:** Perform the But-For test on the *omission itself*: would the outcome have been prevented if the agent had acted? Alternatively, did the omission sustain a pre-existing condition that was part of a sufficient set?

6.  **Weigh Instructions & Norms:** Consider if the agent was following or violating explicit instructions or social norms. This helps establish a normative baseline for an omission or if an action was deviant.

7.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**
    *   For **causal questions:** If the action/omission was a necessary *or* sufficient proximate cause, answer **Yes**. Otherwise, **No**.
    *   For **intentionality questions:** If the agent had the goal/knowledge and control, answer **Yes**. Otherwise, **No**.

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution theory. Your task is to answer questions about whether a specific agent caused a specific outcome. First, determine the type of causal question: is it about **Attribution of Blame/Responsibility** or about the **Agent's Intention/Knowledge**? Then, follow this structured framework:

**CRITICAL INVARIANTS:**
*   **Necessity â‰  Sufficiency:** A necessary action is a prerequisite but never sufficient for a "Yes" answer.
*   **Deviance is Key for Attribution:** For blame/responsibility, causation is attributed to a **deviant** action or omission. Scrutinize normative status above all else.
*   **For Intention, Focus on the Agent's Plan:** For intentionality, analyze if the outcome was a goal of the agent's plan or a known side-effect. **Awareness is key.**
*   **Ignore Probability:** An event's likelihood does not affect its normative or causal status.
*   **Symmetry Denies Singular Attribution:** If multiple agents provided identical necessary conditions with identical normative status, you cannot attribute causation to any single one. (In symmetric overdetermination, attribute to all.)
*   **Knowledge Determines Status:** An agent cannot commit a deviant act without awareness of the norm. An agent cannot intend an outcome they are not aware of.

**FRAMEWORK STEPS:**

0.  **Define Outcome & Question Type:** Precisely state the outcome. **Classify the question: Attribution (blame/responsibility) or Intention (goal of action).**

1.  **Identify Causal Relevance:**
    *   **For Attribution:** List all actual, contributing actions/omissions. (In overdetermination, all sufficient causes are relevant.)
    *   **For Intention:** Identify the agent's action and all outcomes they were aware would result.

2.  **Assess Status (Based on Question Type):**
    *   **For Attribution:** Categorize each contributing factor as:
        *   **"Deviant"**: Violating rules, norms, or reasonable expectations. **For omissions, this requires duty, capacity, AND knowledge to act.**
        *   **"Default"**: Following rules, norms, or expectations. **An omission is default if there is no duty, no capacity, or no knowledge.**
    *   **For Intention:** Categorize the outcome as **"Goal"** (desired end state) or **"Side-effect"** (foreseen but undesired).

3.  **Evaluate Asymmetry (For Attribution):** Actively seek *normative asymmetry*. If all contributing causes are symmetric (identical normative status), do not attribute causation to a single agent.

4.  **Determine Proximate Cause (For Attribution):** Identify the most proximate, sufficient cause that wrongfully interrupted the normal state of affairs.

5.  **Final Judgment:**
    *   **For Attribution:** Answer "Yes" **iff** the agent's action/inaction was a contributing cause *and* was uniquely deviant.
    *   **For Intention:** Answer "Yes" **iff** the agent was aware of the outcome and it was a **Goal** of their action.

Answer strictly with "Yes" or "No".
lame, fault, responsibility, duty, or a negative normative judgment (e.g., "cause the problem," "is at fault"), perform an **Attribution Analysis**.

**KEY GUIDELINES:**
*   **Define the Outcome Precisely:** Your first step is to state the exact outcome from the question. Do not generalize or rephrase it loosely.
*   **Normative Filter for Causation:** Even for Actual Causation, the cause is often the **abnormal** or **deviant** factor that made the difference. When applying counterfactuals, consider holding fixed the normal, expected, or default conditions.
*   **Intent is Internal:** For Intentionality, ignore the outcome's morality. Focus only on the agent's specific desires and knowledge.
*   **Attribution is Normative:** For Attribution, judge actions/omissions against a standard of "deviance." For *actions*, deviance is typically judged objectively against rules. For *omissions*, it is judged subjectively (requiring duty, capacity, and knowledge).

    *   **Intentionality:** "Did X intend to cause Y?"

2.  **Identify the Action/Omission and its Result:** Pinpoint the specific act (or failure to act) and its direct outcome. **Pay close attention to the precise manner and timing in which the outcome occurred in the actual scenario.**

3.  **Analyze Factual Causation (If Applicable):**
    *   **Apply the "But-For" Test (Necessity):** In the *actual scenario*, would the outcome have occurred *in the exact same way and at the exact same time* without this specific action/omission? If **no**, it is a **necessary cause**. **(This is the primary test).**
    *   **Apply the "Sufficient Set" Test (for Overdetermination):** If the action/omission was *not necessary*, was it part of the *actual set* of conditions that were collectively sufficient to cause the outcome **at that moment**? If **yes**, it is a **sufficient cause**. **(A cause can be sufficient but not necessary).**
    *   **Important:** **For causation questions, a positive answer from EITHER the But-For test OR the Sufficient Set test means the action is a factual cause.** Proceed to check for proximate cause.
    *   **Analyze Proximate Causation:** For a necessary or sufficient cause, was it the most direct cause? Check for any independent, unforeseeable intervening events that break the causal chain. **(If found, answer may be No).**

4.  **Analyze Intentionality (If Applicable):**
    *   **Identify the Agent's Goal:** What was the agent's desired outcome?
    *   **Assess the Agent's Knowledge:** Did the agent know their action would likely lead to the result?

5.  **Analyze Omissions (If Applicable):**
    *   **CRITICAL: For a "did cause" question, first perform the But-For test IGNORING DUTY.** Would the outcome have been prevented if the agent had acted? If yes, the omission is a factual cause.
    *   **Then, establish if this omission should be attributed to the agent:** Did the agent have a duty to act (from role, responsibility, instructions, or prior action)? **A lack of duty may mean the agent is not *responsible*, but it does not change the factual finding that the omission was a cause.** For questions specifically about "causation by omission," duty is required for a final "Yes".

6.  **Weigh Instructions & Norms:** Consider if the agent was following or violating explicit instructions or social norms. **This can help establish a baseline. An action that is purely normative (e.g., simply following orders) is less likely to be singled out as *the* cause if the outcome resulted from a confluence of such normal actions and no single agent's action was abnormal.** Use this to check your conclusion from Step 3.

7.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**
    *   For **causal questions:** If the action/omission was a necessary *or* sufficient proximate cause, answer **Yes**. **If the action was purely normative and part of an overdetermined set where no single agent's action was abnormal, consider answering No.** Otherwise, **No**.
    *   For **intentionality questions:** If the agent had the goal/knowledge and control, answer **Yes**. Otherwise, **No**.

You are an expert in causal reasoning and attribution theory. Your task is to answer questions about whether a specific agent caused a specific outcome.

**FIRST AND MOST CRITICAL STEP: CLASSIFY THE QUESTION TYPE**
Your entire analytical framework depends on correctly classifying the query into one of these three types:
*   **Type 1: Mechanistic Causation ("Caused"):** Questions about causal dependence in a physical, legal, or abstract system (e.g., "Did the button press cause the light?", "Was the contract voided because of the error?"). **Focus on counterfactual dependence. Norms and intent are irrelevant.**
*   **Type 2: Blameworthy/Deviant Causation ("Responsible/To Blame"):** Questions about fault, responsibility, or blame for a negative outcome (e.g., "Is the driver responsible for the crash?"). **Scrutinize norms, duties, and deviance.**
*   **Type 3: Intentionality ("Intentionally"):** Questions about the agent's state of mind (e.g., "Did she intentionally mislead him?"). **Scrutinize awareness, goals, and attitude.**

**CORE PRINCIPLES:**
*   **Necessity is not Sufficiency:** An action being necessary is a prerequisite for Type 2 attribution but is never, on its own, enough for a "Yes" answer.
*   **Deviance is Key for Type 2:** For blame/responsibility, causation is attributed to a **deviant** action or omission.
*   **For Type 3, Focus on the Agent's Mind:** Awareness is necessary, but indifference can be sufficient for a "Yes" answer to "intentionally."
*   **Ignore Probability:** The likelihood of an event is irrelevant.
*   **Symmetry Denies Singular Attribution:** If multiple agents provided identical necessary conditions with identical normative status (Type 2) or mental states (Type 3), you cannot attribute causation to any single one. **Exception:** In cases of symmetric overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes), attribute causation to all involved agents for Type 1 and Type 2 questions.

**TYPE-SPECIFIC FRAMEWORKS:**

#### **For TYPE 1 (Mechanistic Causation)**
1.  **Define the Outcome:** Precisely state the outcome from the question.
2.  **Run the Counterfactual Test:** For the agent's specific action or omission, ask: "If the agent had **not** done this (i.e., had done the opposite), would the outcome **still have occurred** in the exact same way?"
    *   If **Yes** â†’ The action/omission was **not a cause**. Answer **No**.
    *   If **No** â†’ The action/omission was **a cause**. Answer **Yes**.
3.  **Final Judgment:** Answer based solely on the counterfactual test. Ignore norms and intent.

#### **For TYPE 2 (Blameworthy / Deviant Causation)**
0.  **Prerequisite:** First, establish the action/omission was a **mechanistic cause** using the Type 1 framework. If not, answer **No**.
1.  **Assess Normative Status:** Categorize the action or omission as:
    *   **"Deviant"**: Violating a formal rule, moral norm, or reasonable expectation. An omission is deviant *only* if the agent had a **duty**, the **capacity**, *and* the **knowledge** to act.
    *   **"Default"**: Following rules, norms, or expectations.
2.  **Evaluate Asymmetry:** If the outcome had multiple contributing causes, determine if the agent's deviant action was the most proximate, salient break from normality.
3.  **Final Judgment:** The agent is the cause **if and only if** their action/omission was a mechanistic cause (Type 1) **and** was deviant. If the cause was default or part of a symmetric set, the agent is not the *sole* cause.

#### **For TYPE 3 (Intentionality)**
1.  **Identify Awareness:** Was the agent aware that their action would bring about the outcome? If **No**, answer **No**.
2.  **Categorize the Outcome:**
    *   **"Goal"**: The outcome was a desired end-state or a necessary step in their plan.
    *   **"Known Side-Effect"**: The outcome was foreseen but not desired.
3.  **Apply the Indifference Test:** Did the agent exhibit indifference, acceptance, or recklessness toward the outcome? (e.g., "did not care at all").
4.  **Final Judgment:** An agent intentionally caused an outcome **if**:
    *   It was a **Goal**, OR
    *   It was a **Known Side-Effect** and the agent was **indifferent or accepting** of it.
    Answer **No** only if the outcome was an unknown side-effect or a known side-effect the agent was reluctant about or tried to avoid.

**FINAL OUTPUT:** After your analysis, answer strictly with "Yes" or "No".

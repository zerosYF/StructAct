Answer questions about causal attribution. To do this correctly, you must apply the following analytical framework:

1.  **For Causation of Events:** Use a counterfactual test: "Would the outcome have occurred if the agent had *not* performed the action?"
    *   If the outcome would **not** have happened without the action, then the action **was** a cause.
    *   If the outcome **would** have happened anyway (e.g., due to a redundant or preempting cause), then the action was **not** a cause.
    *   A necessary component of a sufficient condition is not necessarily the actual cause; focus on what made the difference for this specific outcome.

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying rigorous causal reasoning. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify the outcome and the alleged cause(s).**
2.  **Determine the triggering condition:** Next, identify the exact physical mechanism that produces the outcome (e.g., is it an AND gate, an OR gate, or another type of condition?).
3.  **Apply counterfactual reasoning (Necessity Test):** For this step, ask "Would the outcome have occurred if the specific action/omission had not happened?" This establishes if the cause was *necessary* in this specific scenario.
4.  **Check for Causal Sufficiency:** Then, determine if the action/omission by itself could have produced the outcome.
5.  **Evaluate Normality and Defaults: This is often the decisive factor.** Here, compare the action to the expected, prescribed, or **default** course of events.
    *   Was the action a **deviation** from a rule, policy, standard procedure, or norm?
    *   Was it a **violation**, or was it **compliant**?
    *   **Weight:** **Abnormal/deviant actions are typically assigned causal strength. Normal, compliant actions are often considered part of the background conditions and not singled out as "the cause," even if they are necessary.**
6.  **Analyze the Causal Chain:**
    *   **Proximacy:** How many steps are between the cause and the outcome? Are there intervening actions by other agents (especially negligent or intentional ones)? Distant, indirect causes are often considered conditions, not causes.
    *   **Foreseeability:** Could a reasonable agent have foreseen the outcome? Unforeseeable outcomes weaken causal attribution.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following this structured reasoning process:

1.  **Deconstruct the Scenario:** Identify the explicit or implicit causal mechanism (e.g., single cause, AND/OR gate) that produces the outcome.
2.  **Analyze Each Agent:** For every relevant agent, determine:
    a. Their action.
    b. Their knowledge of the rules and situation.
    c. Their intention and primary goal.
    d. Whether they followed or deviated from a plan or norm.
3.  **Apply Counterfactual Tests:** Evaluate if the outcome would have occurred "but-for" the agent's action.
4.  **Synthesize Attribution:** Distinguish causation from intentionality.
    - An agent *caused* the outcome if their action was a necessary part of the causal mechanism.
    - An agent acted *intentionally* only if the outcome was their goal or desired consequence, not merely a foreseeable side effect.

You are an expert in causal attribution and intentionality. Your task is to analyze scenarios and answer questions by applying a specific, rigorous analytical framework.

**Framework for Analysis:**
*   **Intentionality:** An outcome is **intentional** only if it was a **specific goal or desire** of the actor. A foreseen but undesired side effect does **not** qualify as intentional.
*   **Causation:** An event is a **cause** of an outcome if the outcome is **counterfactually dependent** on it. This is determined by applying the following test: "If Event X had **not** occurred, would Outcome Y still have happened?"
    *   If the answer is **yes**, then Event X was **not** a cause.
    *   If the answer is **no**, then Event X **was** a cause.
    *   **Note on Overdetermination:** If the outcome would have occurred even without the event (e.g., due to another sufficient cause), then the event is not a cause.

**Instructions for Response:**
1.  **First, identify the question type:** Determine if the question pertains to *intentionality* (about an actor's goals) or *causation* (about counterfactual dependence). Apply the corresponding rule.
2.  **Apply the framework rigorously:**
    *   For **causation:** Explicitly apply the counterfactual test. Identify the specific event (X) and outcome (Y). Construct the counterfactual scenario where X does not happen. Rely **strictly on the provided information** to determine if Y would still occur. Do not introduce external assumptions.
    *   For **intentionality:** Determine if the outcome was a *specific goal or desire* of the actor. Use the actor's expressed intentions as primary evidence. A foreseen side effect is not intentional unless it was also desired.
3.  **Structure your response exactly as follows:**
    *   **Analysis:** Provide a step-by-step application of the framework. Explicitly reference the rules (e.g., "Applying the counterfactual test..."). Ensure strong linguistic cohesion and logical flow between ideas.
    *   **Conclusion:** Summarize the logical conclusion derived from your analysis.
    *   **Final Answer:** Clearly state your final answer as `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following this structured reasoning process. Adhere strictly to these rules:

1.  **Abstract the Causal Model:** Begin by explicitly identifying the formal causal mechanism (e.g., AND gate, OR gate) that produces the outcome. This model is the foundational framework for all analysis.
2.  **Analyze Each Agent's Role:** For every relevant agent or factor, determine:
    a. Their specific action.
    b. Their knowledge of the situation and any rules/norms.
    c. Their primary goal or intention.
    d. Whether their action followed or deviated from a plan or norm.
3.  **Apply the Definitive Counterfactual Test:** For causation, ask: **"But-for this agent's action, would the outcome have occurred?"**
    - If **no**, the action was a necessary cause.
    - If **yes**, it was not.
    - **This test is the absolute standard for establishing causation.**
4.  **Synthesize with Clear Distinctions:**
    - **Causation** is determined solely by the counterfactual test (necessity).
    - **Intentionality** is determined solely by goal alignment (purpose), not foreseeability.

Derive your final answer directly from this multi-step analysis. Ensure your response exhibits strong linguistic cohesion, smooth transitions, and preserves the original query's meaning.

Answer questions about causal attribution.
Your goal is to determine if a described outcome happened *because* of a specific person's action or inaction.

**Definition:** For this task, an outcome happens "because" of an action/inaction if that action/inaction was a critical factor. It is critical if, in a counterfactual scenario where *only* the agent's specific action/inaction was different, the outcome would have changed.

**Reasoning Steps:**
1.  **Identify the Logical Condition:** First, extract the explicit or implicit logical rule governing the outcome (e.g., "Y happens if A AND B are true" or "Y happens if A OR B is true"). This is the most critical factor for your decision.
2.  **Isolate the Agent's Action:** Focus exclusively on the specific action or inaction of the agent mentioned in the question. All other factors in the scenario must be considered fixed and unchanged.
3.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test:** Construct a counterfactual world where the agent performed the opposite of their actual action (e.g., if they "did not act," imagine they *did act*; if they "acted," imagine they *did not act*).
4.  **Compare Outcomes:** Determine if the outcome in this counterfactual world would be different from the actual outcome.
    - For an **AND** condition, the action is likely a cause if it was a necessary factor.
    - For an **OR** condition, the action is **not** a cause if another sufficient factor would have caused the outcome anyway.
5.  **Reach a Verdict:** If the outcome would be different, the answer is "Yes". If the outcome would be the same, the answer is "No".

**Special Case for "Intentionally":**
If the question asks if an outcome was caused "intentionally," you must check two things:
1.  **Causal Necessity:** Was the agent's action a critical factor for the outcome? (Apply the standard counterfactual test above).
2.  **Purposeful Action:** Did the agent perform the action *with the goal* of achieving that outcome? Look for keywords like "hoping," "wanting," or "to achieve" in the narrative.
Both conditions must be met for a "Yes" answer. The randomness of an outcome does not negate the intentionality of the attempt.

**Response Structure:**
First, reason step-by-step according to the instructions above. Explicitly state the logical condition you identified and construct the counterfactual scenario. Your reasoning must demonstrate a seamless flow from these steps to your final verdict. Use appropriate cohesive devices to link your logic, enhancing clarity. Throughout this process, you must maintain the original narrative meaning, including all events and actions.

**Final Output:**
Your final output must be structured as follows:

You are an expert in causal attribution and intentionality. Your task is to analyze scenarios and answer questions by applying a specific, rigorous analytical framework.

**Framework for Analysis:**
*   **Intentionality:** An outcome is **intentional** only if it was a **specific goal or desire** of the actor. A foreseen but undesired side effect does **not** qualify as intentional.
*   **Causation:** An event is a **cause** of an outcome if the outcome is **counterfactually dependent** on it. This is determined by applying the following test: "If Event X had **not** occurred, would Outcome Y still have happened?"
    *   If the answer is **yes**, then Event X was **not** a cause.
    *   If the answer is **no**, then Event X **was** a cause.
    *   **Note on Overdetermination:** If the outcome would have occurred even without the event (e.g., due to another sufficient cause), then the event is not a cause.
    *   **Note on Omissions:** When analyzing an omission (e.g., 'did not change X'), the event X is 'the absence of an action.' The counterfactual test becomes: 'If the actor *had* performed the action, would the outcome have been different?' Apply the test rigorously.

**Instructions for Response:**
1.  **First, identify the question type:** Begin by stating: "This is a question about [Intentionality/Causation], therefore I will apply the [Intentionality/Causation] rule."
2.  **Define the Outcome with Precision:** **Before any analysis, you MUST define the specific Outcome Y based on the exact wording of the question.** This is a non-negotiable step.
3.  **Apply the framework rigorously:**
    *   For **Causation:**
        *   Identify the specific event (X) and the precisely defined outcome (Y).
        *   **Construct the counterfactual scenario:** Imagine a world where **only** Event X is changed (it does not happen). All other events and conditions remain exactly as described.
        *   **Answer the test literally:** Based solely on this constructed scenario, answer 'yes' or 'no' to the question 'Would Y still have happened?'
        *   **Derive the conclusion directly from this answer.** If the outcome would have been guaranteed by another event even without X, you MUST conclude that X is not a cause (overdetermination).
        *   **Strictly isolate the causal chain.** Rely **strictly on the provided information.** Do not be swayed by moral judgments, intentions, or narrative emphasis. Focus only on counterfactual dependence.
    *   For **Intentionality:**
        *   Determine if the outcome was a *specific goal or desire* of the actor. The actor's own statements about their goals are the highest evidence.
        *   Distinguish between a **general goal** and the **specific outcome.** A known side effect that the actor is indifferent to is not intentional.
4.  **Structure your response exactly as follows:**
    *   **Analysis:** Provide a step-by-step application of the framework. Explicitly reference the rules. Ensure strong linguistic cohesion and logical flow.
    *   **Conclusion:** Summarize the logical conclusion derived from your analysis.
    *   **Final Answer:** Clearly state your final answer as `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these steps:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Precisely define the effect we are explaining.
2.  **Identify Candidate Causes:** List all events or omissions proposed as potential causes.
3.  **Apply the Sufficiency Test:** For each candidate, ask: "Was this event a necessary part of a set of conditions that were **sufficient** to bring about the outcome **in the actual circumstances**?"
    - **Focus on actual events:** Only consider what *actually happened* and the *rules of the scenario*. Ignore counterfactual possibilities.
    - A candidate is a cause if it was sufficient on its own OR if it was a necessary component of a combination that was sufficient.
    - A candidate is **not** a cause if the outcome was already inevitable due to a *different* sufficient set that did not include it.
4.  **Check for Intentionality (if asked):** Only if the question involves "intentionally," determine if the agent had knowledge of the outcome and acted with purpose or desire to bring it about. A lack of desire or care implies no intention, even if the action was causally sufficient.
5.  **Conclude:** State your answer based on the above analysis.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these steps carefully:

1.  **Interpret the Question:**
    *   Determine if the question is about **causal responsibility** (what event caused the outcome) or **mental state** (e.g., intention, knowledge). **If the question includes words like 'intentionally' or 'knowingly', it is a mental state question; base analysis on the actor's goals and knowledge, not just causation.**
    *   Note if the question asks for **"the cause"** (typically the most proximate, operative cause) or **"a cause"** (any contributing factor).

2.  **Identify the Outcome:** Precisely define the specific effect, including its timing and nature.

3.  **Identify Candidate Causes:** List all events, actions, omissions, or conditions proposed as potential causes.

4.  **Apply the Operative Cause Test:** For each candidate, analyze its role using these sub-tests:
    *   **Check for Actual Sequence Primacy:** In the actual timeline, did this candidate **trigger** the outcome? Was it the first event to satisfy the sufficient condition for the outcome? If yes, it is a strong candidate for being the operative cause.
    *   **Check for Preemption:** If a prior event had already created a set of conditions that were sufficient to **and did** guarantee the outcome, then any subsequent candidate is preempted and is not the operative cause.
    *   **Check for Omissions:** An omission is only a cause if there was a clear and specific duty to act. Otherwise, focus on active causes.
    *   **Check for Overdetermination:** If two or more independent events were simultaneously sufficient to cause the outcome, then **all of them are causes**. **Remember: causation does not require necessity in cases of overdetermination; sufficient causes that occurred are still causes.**

5.  **Test with a Focused Counterfactual:** To evaluate necessity, ask: "If this specific candidate had been absent, *while holding all other events exactly as they were*, would the outcome have occurred at that exact moment and in that exact way?"
    *   If **NO**, the candidate is a necessary cause.
    *   If **YES**, the candidate is not a *necessary* cause, but it may still be a *sufficient* cause that occurred in the actual sequence. Proceed to step 6.

6.  **Conclude and Synthesize:**
    *   **If the question is about mental state (e.g., "intentionally")**, base your answer on the actor's goals, desires, and control over the specific outcome. **Intention requires desire or aim, not mere foresight or knowledge.**
    *   **If the question asks for "the cause":** Identify the most proximate, operative cause from the actual sequence, often the first sufficient trigger that was not preempted.
    *   **If the question asks for "a cause" or "because of":** An event can be "a cause" if it was a sufficient factor that occurred in the actual sequence, **even if it was not necessary** due to overdetermination. The counterfactual test is useful for showing something is *not* a cause, but cannot alone rule out a sufficient cause that actually happened.
    *   State your final answer, ensuring it aligns with the question's phrasing and intent. **Separate causal contribution from moral or legal responsibility.**

3.  **Apply the Sufficiency Test:** For each candidate, ask: "In the actual circumstances, was this event part of a set of conditions that were sufficient to bring about the outcome?" Remember: the candidate does not need to be the only cause or sufficient by itself; it only needs to be part of a sufficient set that *actually occurred*.
4.  **Identify Defaults and Deviations:** Analyze the context to determine:
    *   **Default/Normal/Expected Events:** Which events were intended, highly probable (e.g., >90% chance), routine, allowed by rules, or part of the standard background scenario?
    *   **Deviant/Abnormal/Salient Events:** Which events were unintended, improbable (e.g., <10% chance), a violation of rules or design, or an unexpected change from the normal course?
5.  **Conclude with Causal Selection:** A candidate is considered a cause if it was both (a) part of a sufficient set in the actual sequence of events, and (b) the **deviant** or **abnormal** factor. A candidate that was merely a **default** or background condition, even if necessary, is not selected as *the* cause. If multiple candidates are deviant, select the most direct or salient one.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these steps:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Precisely define the effect we are explaining.
2.  **Identify Candidate Causes:** List all concrete events, actions, or omissions proposed as potential causes. Do not include background conditions, abstract traits, or dispositions.
3.  **Apply the Causal Analysis Framework:** For each candidate, analyze it through three distinct lenses:
    *   **A. Physical Necessity (NESS Test):** Determine if this candidate was a necessary part of *any* physically possible set of conditions that were sufficient to bring about the outcome. **A candidate passes NESS if there exists a scenario (even if not actualized) where it is necessary for a sufficient set. This is crucial for overdetermination.**
    *   **B. Counterfactual Dependence:** Assess whether the outcome would have been different **in the closest possible world where this candidate had been absent or different** (e.g., if an action had not been taken, or if an omission had been an action). **Hold all other candidate causes and background conditions constant unless they are logically dependent on the change.**
    *   **C. Normative & Pragmatic Factors:** **Only consider these if you have already established that the candidate is a cause (via A or B).** These factors determine which cause we focus on or blame:
        -   **Abnormality:** Was this candidate a deviation from the norm or a statistically surprising event?
        -   **Intentionality & Knowledge:** Did the agent act with purpose, desire, or knowledge of the outcome? (Only for questions about "intentionally".)
        -   **Moral/Legal Roles:** Was the agent permitted or obligated to act? Outcomes are often attributed to the violation of an obligation.
4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**
    -   A candidate that fails both the NESS and Counterfactual tests is **not a cause**.
    -   **A candidate that passes the NESS test is a cause, even if it fails the counterfactual test.** This is fundamental for cases of overdetermination.
    -   A candidate that passes the counterfactual test is also a cause.
    -   **Omissions can be causes:** Evaluate them by considering what would have happened if the agent had acted.
    -   Use Normative factors (C) to **select** the most salient cause **only when multiple candidates are valid causes**. The question's framing often hints at which factor is most important.
    -   **Distinguish between causation and intentionality.** Causing an outcome does not imply intending it.
    -   **Special Cases:**
        *   **Simultaneous Overdetermination (e.g., two sufficient causes):** All are causes via the NESS test.
        *   **Preemption (e.g., one cause occurs before another would have):** Use the counterfactual test ("holding the other candidate fixed...") to identify the preempting cause.
    -   State your final answer based on this overall synthesis.

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying rigorous causal reasoning. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify the outcome and the alleged cause(s).**
2.  **Determine the exact triggering condition** for the outcome (the minimal set of conditions that directly produces the result).
3.  **Apply counterfactual reasoning:** Explicitly ask "Would the outcome have occurred if the action had not been taken (or the omission had not happened)?" This is your primary test.
4.  **Check necessity:** Was the action/omission *necessary* for the outcome? If the outcome would have occurred anyway, the answer is **No**. This is the most important criterion.
5.  **Check sufficiency:** Was the action/omission *sufficient* to cause the outcome? This is informative but secondary to necessity.
6.  **For multiple causes:** Isolate the alleged cause. In cases of overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes), if the outcome was already guaranteed by a prior cause, a subsequent action is **not** necessary and therefore not causal.
7.  **For omissions:** Only an omission by an agent who was *explicitly supposed to act* (had a duty or assignment) can be causal. Apply the counterfactual: "If they *had* acted, would the outcome have been prevented?"
8.  **For intentionality:** Consider the agent's goals and knowledge only if they are part of the described causal chain. Do not let a lack of intent negate a causal link if the action was necessary.
9.  **Ignore irrelevant details:** Disregard permissions, probabilities, personality traits, or social norms that do not directly affect the causal chain. Focus only on the factual events that occurred.
10. **Trace the causal chain:** Verbally map the direct, unbroken link from the cause to the outcome. If the outcome was inevitable from a pre-existing condition, the alleged cause is not necessary.

**Your analysis must be grounded in these principles. Remember: necessity is paramount. An action/omission is a cause only if it was necessary for the outcome.**

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying rigorous causal reasoning. Follow these steps precisely and explicitly:

1.  **Identify the Outcome and Alleged Cause(s):** Clearly state the effect and the specific action/omission in question.
2.  **Map the Causal Model:** Detail the exact physical/logical mechanism and key variables that lead to the outcome (e.g., AND-gate, chemical reaction).
3.  **Apply Actual Causation Testing:**
    a.  **Necessity in the Circumstances (Counterfactual):** Holding all other actual events fixed, would the outcome have occurred if the specific action had **not** been taken?
    b.  **Priority of the Actual Process:** If the outcome was **overdetermined** (multiple sufficient causes existed), identify which cause was part of the **actual process** that unfolded. A redundant action that was not operative is not a cause.
4.  **Check for Normative Responsibility:**
    *   **For Actions:** If an agent **violated a rule or duty**, their action is a **deviant** factor that strengthens causal responsibility, even in overdetermined scenarios.
    *   **For Omissions:** Only an omission by an agent who was *supposed to act* and was *capable of acting* can be causal.
5.  **Avoid the Sufficiency Trap:** An action does not need to be sufficient on its own to be a cause. Many causes are only **jointly necessary** (e.g., two chemicals, two wires).
6.  **Evaluate Intentionality (If Relevant):** **Separate causation from intent.** After establishing the causal chain, evaluate if the agent had a goal, desire, or knowledge that the outcome would occur. Do not infer intent from causation alone.
7.  **Final Synthesis:** Weigh the findings from the actual causation test (Step 3) and the normative responsibility test (Step 4). An action that was necessary is a cause. An action that was part of the actual process but not necessary due to a backup can **still be a cause**, especially if it carries normative responsibility.

6.  **Check sufficiency:** Was the action/omission *sufficient* to cause the outcome? This is informative but secondary to necessity.
7.  **For multiple causes:** Isolate the alleged cause. In cases of overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes), if the outcome was already guaranteed by a prior cause, a subsequent action is **not** necessary and therefore not causal.
8.  **For omissions:** Only an omission by an agent who had a **clear and explicit duty, responsibility, or assignment** to act can be causal. Apply the counterfactual: "If they *had* acted, would the outcome have been prevented?"
9.  **For intentionality:** The agent's knowledge, intentions, or goals are irrelevant for establishing a causal link, unless the question specifically asks about them. Do not let a lack of intent negate a causal link if the action was necessary.
10. **Ignore irrelevant details:** Disregard permissions, probabilities, personality traits, or social norms that do not directly affect the causal chain. Focus only on the factual events that occurred.
11. **Trace the causal chain:** Verbally map the direct, unbroken link from the cause to the outcome.

**Your analysis must be grounded in these principles. Remember: necessity is paramount. An action/omission is a cause only if it was necessary for the outcome.**

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying rigorous causal reasoning. Follow these steps precisely and explicitly, in order:

1.  **Identify the Outcome and Alleged Cause(s):** State the effect and the specific action/omission in question.
2.  **Map the Causal Model:** Detail the exact physical/logical mechanism (e.g., AND-gate, OR-gate, threshold) and the key variables that lead to the outcome. This step is foundational.
3.  **Apply Actual Causation Testing:**
    a.  **Necessity in the Circumstances (Counterfactual):** This is the primary test. Holding all other actual events fixed, would the outcome have occurred if the specific action had **not** been taken?
    b.  **Priority of the Actual Process:** If the outcome was **overdetermined** (multiple sufficient causes existed), identify which cause was part of the **actual process** that unfolded. A redundant action that was not operative is not a cause.
4.  **Check for Normative Responsibility:**
    *   **For Actions:** If an agent **violated a rule or duty**, their action is a **deviant** factor that can strengthen causal responsibility.
    *   **For Omissions:** Only an omission by an agent who was *supposed to act* and was *capable of acting* can be causal.
    *   *Note: Normative responsibility can strengthen attribution but is not required for causation.*
5.  **Avoid the Sufficiency Trap:** An action does not need to be sufficient on its own to be a cause. Many causes are only **jointly necessary** (e.g., two chemicals, two wires, multiple actors).
6.  **Evaluate Intentionality (If Relevant):** **Separate causation from intent.** After establishing the causal chain, evaluate if the agent had a goal, desire, or knowledge that the outcome would occur. Do not infer intent from causation alone.
7.  **Final Synthesis:** Weigh the findings from the actual causation test (Step 3) and the normative responsibility test (Step 4). An action that was necessary is a cause. An action that was part of the actual process but not necessary due to a backup can **still be a cause**, especially if it carries normative responsibility.

Your reasoning must be grounded in these principles. Always conclude with a final answer inside <answer> tags: <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.

You are an expert in causal attribution and intentionality. Your task is to analyze scenarios and answer questions by applying a specific, rigorous analytical framework.

**Framework for Analysis:**
*   **Intentionality:** An outcome is **intentional** only if it was a **specific goal or desire** of the actor. A foreseen but undesired side effect does **not** qualify as intentional.
*   **Causation:** An event is a **cause** of an outcome if the outcome is **counterfactually dependent** on it. An event is a cause only if it was *necessary*. If the outcome would have occurred even without the event (due to other sufficient causes), then the event is not a cause.

**Instructions for Response:**
1.  **Identify:** Determine if the question is about *causation* or *intentionality*.
2.  **Isolate:** Identify the specific **Event X** and **Outcome Y**. Ignore all extraneous narrative details, character motivations, and background conditions not directly necessary for the analysis.
3.  **Analyze:**
    *   **For Causation:** Formally apply the counterfactual test. Construct a world where *only* Event X is removed (do not change other events unless they are logically dependent on X). Ask: "If Event X had **not** occurred, would Outcome Y still have happened?"
        *   If **yes**, then Event X was **not** a cause.
        *   If **no**, then Event X **was** a cause.
    *   **For Intentionality:** Determine the actor's primary goal(s) from their statements and actions. If Outcome Y was not a goal or desire, it is unintentional, even if it was foreseen, known, or inevitable.
4.  **Separate:** Treat causation and intentionality as independent analyses. Do not conflate them or introduce moral judgments or external assumptions.
5.  **Structure your response exactly as follows:**
    *   **Analysis:** Provide a step-by-step application of the framework, showing your work on the above points.
    *   **Conclusion:** Summarize the logical conclusion.
    *   **Final Answer:** State your final answer as `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.

You are an expert in causal attribution and intentionality. Your task is to analyze scenarios and answer questions by applying a specific, rigorous analytical framework.

**Framework for Analysis:**
*   **Intentionality:** An outcome is **intentional** only if it was a **specific goal or desire** of the actor. A foreseen but undesired side effect does **not** qualify as intentional.
*   **Causation:** An event is a **cause** of an outcome if the outcome is **counterfactually dependent** on it. An event is a cause only if it was *necessary*. If the outcome would have occurred even without the event (due to other sufficient causes), then the event is not a cause.

**Core Reasoning Strategies:**
1.  **Strict Outcome Isolation:** Identify the exact **Event X** and **Outcome Y** from the question. Do not analyze a different, more salient, or ultimate outcome.
2.  **Minimal Counterfactual:** For causation, construct a world identical to the actual world except that **only Event X is deleted**. Do not change other events unless they are logically dependent on X. The answer is determined solely by: "In the world without X, does Y still happen?"
3.  **Goal-State Analysis:** For intentionality, determine the actor's **primary goal(s)**. If Y is the goal or a **necessary means** to that goal, it is intentional. If Y is a foreseen but undesired consequence, it is **not** intentional.
4.  **Independence:** Treat causation and intentionality as separate, independent analyses. Do not conflate them.

**Instructions for Response:**
1.  **Identify:** Determine if the question is about *causation* or *intentionality*.

        *   If **no**, then Event X **was** a cause (e.g., it was a necessary or INUS condition).
    *   **For Intentionality:** Determine if Outcome Y was a goal or a necessary mechanism for a goal. If not, it is unintentional, even if foreseen or inevitable.
4.  **Structure your response exactly as follows:**

    *   **Conclusion:** Summarize the logical conclusion.
    *   **Final Answer:** State your final answer as `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**
*   Do not confuse a necessary *means* with an unintentional side effect.
*   Do not assume foresight or knowledge implies intent.
*   Do not change other events in the counterfactual world unless logically entailed by the removal of X.
*   Beware of preemption: an event is not a cause if the outcome was already guaranteed.

You are an expert analyst applying a rigorous framework for causal attribution and intentionality. Your analysis must be strictly logical and ignore all narrative details, moral judgments, or concepts of responsibility not directly relevant to the defined Event X and Outcome Y.

**Core Principles:**
1.  **Separation:** Causation and intentionality are independent. Never let the analysis of one influence the other.
2.  **Isolation:** Identify only the specific **Event X** and **Outcome Y** from the question. Ignore all other events, motivations, and background conditions.
3.  **Minimal Change:** For counterfactuals, construct a world where **only X is removed**. Do not change any other event unless it is logically dependent on X's absence.
4.  **Goal Focus:** For intent, an outcome is intentional **only** if it was a specific goal or a necessary means to that goal. Foreseen side effects are never intentional.

**Framework for Analysis:**

**Step 1: Identify**
Determine if the question is about *causation* or *intentionality*.

**Step 2: Isolate**
Extract the exact **Event X** (the action/event in question) and **Outcome Y** (the specific result being asked about).

**Step 3: Analyze**
*   **For Causation:**
    Apply the counterfactual test: **"In the world where X did not occur, would Y still have happened?"**
    *   If **YES** → X is **not** a cause (e.g., due to overdetermination or preemption).
    *   If **NO** → X **is** a cause.
    *   **Invariant:** Do not assume other changes. If another sufficient cause for Y exists and is present in the actual world, Y *would* happen without X.

You are an expert analyst applying a rigorous, formal framework for causal attribution and intentionality. Your analysis must be strictly logical, context-independent, and ignore all narrative details, moral judgments, or concepts of responsibility not directly relevant to the defined Event X and Outcome Y.

**Core Principles (Non-Negotiable):**
1.  **Separation:** Causation and intentionality are independent. Never let the analysis of one influence the other.
2.  **Precise Isolation:** Identify only the specific **Event X** and **Outcome Y** as stated in the question, including any contextual details. Do not redefine or generalize them.
3.  **Minimal Change (The "Lazy Miracle" Rule):** For counterfactuals, construct a world where **only X is removed**. Do not change any other event, agent's behavior, or background condition unless it is logically impossible for that thing to remain the same given X's absence.
4.  **Goal/Means Focus:** For intent, an outcome is intentional **only** if it was the actor's specific goal or a **necessary means** to that goal (i.e., the goal is logically impossible to achieve without it). Foreseen, inevitable, or probable side effects are never intentional.

**Framework for Analysis:**

**Step 1: Identify**
Determine whether the question is about *causation* or *intentionality*.

**Step 2: Isolate**
Extract the exact **Event X** (the action/event in question) and **Outcome Y** (the specific result, including its context).

**Step 3: Analyze**
*   **For Causation:**
    Apply the counterfactual test: **"In the world where only X did not occur, would Y still have happened?"**
    *   **Crucial:** Actively search for alternative sufficient causes present in the actual world. If one exists, Y *would* happen without X.
    *   If **YES** (Y happens without X) → X is **not** a cause.
    *   If **NO** (Y does not happen without X) → X **is** a cause.

*   **For Intentionality:**
    Identify the actor's **primary goal(s)** from the scenario. Then apply the necessary means test: **"Was Y the goal itself or was it logically necessary for achieving that goal?"**
    *   **Crucial:** If the goal can be conceived of being achieved without Y, then Y is not a necessary means.
    *   If **YES** → Y is **intentional**.
    *   If **NO** → Y is **not** intentional. Foresight or knowledge is irrelevant.

You are an expert in causal attribution and intentionality. Your task is to analyze scenarios and answer questions by applying a specific, rigorous analytical framework.

**Framework for Analysis:**

**1. Intentionality:**
*   An outcome is **intentional** only if it was a **specific goal or desire** of the actor.
*   **For Negative Side Effects:** A foreseen negative outcome is judged as intentional if the actor proceeded with their action, demonstrating **knowing acceptance** or **indifference**. This can be demonstrated by an explicit statement (e.g., "I don't care") or by the narrative's description of the actor's mental state (e.g., "he did not care at all"). Merely foreseeing an outcome is not sufficient for intentionality; the actor's attitude is the key factor.

**2. Causation:**
*   **Counterfactual Test (Primary Gate):** An event is a cause of an outcome if the outcome is **counterfactually dependent** on it. Apply this test: "If Event X had **not** occurred, would Outcome Y still have happened **in the same way and at the same time**?"
    *   If the answer is **yes**, then Event X was **not** a cause.
    *   If the answer is **no**, then Event X **was** a cause.
*   **Overdetermination/Preemption Check:** If the counterfactual test suggests an event is not a cause because the outcome would have happened anyway, override this result **only if** the event was **active and sufficient** in the actual sequence of events that preempted an alternative path (preemption). **Crucially, overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes) does not create causes; it negates them.**
*   **Salience Check (Intervening Cause):** If an event passes the counterfactual test, check for an **intervening cause**. If a **voluntary** (a deliberate act or a choice), **independent** (not forced by the prior event), and **non-normative** (a knowing violation of rules, laws, or standard practice) act occurs after Event X and is itself sufficient to cause Outcome Y, then this intervening cause **supersedes and severs** the causal chain from Event X. Event X is then a background condition, not the salient cause.
*   **Important:** When applying these tests, construct scenarios based on the **established ground truth** of the scenario's mechanics, not a character's possibly flawed beliefs.

**Crucial Reasoning Strategies & Invariants:**

1.  **Ground Truth is Paramount:** The objective rules of the scenario's world (e.g., how a device works, the actual sequence of events) always override a character's beliefs, desires, or misstatements. Resolve contradictions by seeking the foundational, mechanical description.
2.  **Intentionality Hinges on Attitude:** For negative side effects, the actor must exhibit **indifference** or **acceptance**, not just foresight.
3.  **Counterfactual Test is First:** Always perform the counterfactual test first. An event that is not counterfactually necessary is not a cause unless preemption applies.
4.  **Intervening Cause Must Be a Deliberate Violation:** The salience check requires a **non-normative** act, which typically requires knowledge of the norm to violate it. An accidental or ignorant action does not sever the causal chain.
5.  **Distinguish Joint Causation from Overdetermination:** Events that are **individually insufficient but jointly necessary** are all causes. Events that are **individually sufficient** lead to overdetermination, where some are not causes.
6.  **Temporal Order Matters:** A prior sufficient cause can **preempt** the causal role of a later event.

**Instructions for Response:**
1.  **Establish Ground Truth:** Before analysis, parse the scenario to identify the **objective facts and rules**. Prioritize foundational2025-09-04 03:29:53,116 - 📊 Current Template_description:

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these steps:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Begin by precisely defining the specific effect, including its timing and nature.

2.  **Identify Candidate Causes:** Next, list the events, actions, or omissions that have been proposed as potential causes.

3.  **Apply the Operative Cause Test:** For each candidate, determine if it was the proximate, operative cause in the actual sequence of events. To do this:
    *   **Check for Preemption:** Assess whether a prior event had already created a set of conditions sufficient to guarantee the outcome. If so, any subsequent candidate is preempted and is not the operative cause.
    *   **Check for Omissions:** Evaluate if an omission (a failure to act) is a valid cause. This is only true if there was a clear and specific duty to act; otherwise, the focus should remain on active causes.
    *   **Check for Overdetermination:** Determine if two or more independent events were simultaneously sufficient to cause the outcome. If this rare scenario is true, then both are causes.

4.  **Test with a Focused Counterfactual:** To evaluate the efficacy of each candidate, ask: "If this specific candidate had been absent, *while holding all other events exactly as they were*, would the outcome have occurred at that exact moment and in that exact way?" A genuine cause must make a difference to the actual occurrence.

5.  **Conclude:** Finally, state your answer. If a candidate was a necessary part of a causal set but not independently operative, clarify whether it is "a cause" or merely "a condition." Base your final answer on whether the question seeks a singular cause ("the cause") or any contributing factor ("a cause").

3.  **Apply the Operative Cause Test:** For each candidate, analyze its role in the actual sequence of events by applying the following three filters in order:
    *   **First, Check for Preemption:** Determine if a prior event made the outcome inevitable, thereby preempting all subsequent candidates. This is the primary filter.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these steps:

**0. Establish the Context:** Begin by identifying the **causal mechanisms** at play (e.g., physical laws, system rules, game rules). **Additionally, identify any relevant normative context:** rules, duties, permissions, or expected courses of action. **This normative context is crucial for distinguishing a deviant, intervening cause from a mere background condition, but it is not the sole factor in causal attribution.**

**1. Identify the Outcome:** Precisely define the specific effect, including its timing and nature.

**2. Identify Candidate Causes:** List the events, actions, states, or omissions proposed as potential causes.

**3. Apply the Causality Tests:** For each candidate, determine if it was a cause in the actual sequence of events.
    *   **Check for Preemption:** If a prior event had already created a set of conditions sufficient to guarantee the outcome, then any subsequent candidate is preempted and is not a cause.
    *   **Check for Normative Deviance (if applicable):** An action that was permitted, expected, and conformed to the relevant rules is often a background condition. An action that was forbidden, unexpected, or violated a duty is a strong candidate for an operative cause. **However, an action can be both norm-compliant and a cause. Use this test to assign *responsibility*, not to negate causation.**
    *   **Check for Omissions:** An omission (a failure to act) can be a cause if its presence would have prevented the outcome. **A specific duty to act strengthens the case for calling an omission a cause, but even without a duty, an omission can be a causal factor in the chain of events.**
    *   **Check for Overdetermination:** If two or more independent events were simultaneously sufficient to cause the outcome, then both are causes. **This includes cases of "double prevention" and symmetric overdetermination (e.g., two shooters). In such cases, attribute causation to all sufficient candidates.**

**4. Test with a Focused Counterfactual:** To evaluate efficacy, ask: **"Holding all other events and background conditions exactly as they were, if this specific candidate had been different (e.g., the action didn't occur, the state was false, the omission was an action), would the outcome have occurred at that exact moment and in that exact way?"** A cause must make a difference to the actual occurrence. **This is the primary test for causal necessity.**

**5. Conclude and Articulate the Answer:**
    *   **Weigh the results of the counterfactual test most heavily.** If a candidate passes the counterfactual test, it is a cause.
    *   **Interpret the question's intent:**
        *   If the question asks for "**the** cause," prioritize the most direct, necessary, and **often norm-deviant** factor. This is the "operative" cause.
        *   If the question asks for "**a** cause" or uses phrasing like "did X cause Y?" or "because of X," then **any factor that passes the counterfactual test is a valid cause, even if it is norm-compliant or an omission without a strict duty.** The normative context helps explain *why* it is considered the cause, but does not negate its causal role.
    *   **State your answer clearly, ensuring it is justified by the counterfactual dependency you established.**

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these steps:

0.  **Establish the Contextual Frame:** Begin by identifying all relevant norms, duties, standard procedures, or expected courses of action. This frame is the essential foundation for evaluating which events are deviations from the norm.

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Precisely define the specific effect, including its nature and, crucially, the exact moment it was determined to have occurred.

2.  **Identify Candidate Causes:** Next, list all events, actions, omissions, or conditions that have been proposed as potential causes.

3.  **Apply the Operative Cause Test:** For each candidate, determine if it was the proximate, operative cause in the actual sequence of events. **Check in this strict order:**
    *   **Check for Preemption (First Priority):** If a prior event had already created a set of conditions sufficient to guarantee the outcome at a specific time, it preempts all subsequent candidates. Consequently, any event occurring after the outcome is determined cannot be a cause.
    *   **Check for Normative Deviance:** The operative cause is typically the unexpected or forbidden intervention that deviates from the contextual frame established in Step 0. Therefore, prioritize deviant candidates over normative ones, even if both are necessary. A necessary but normative event is usually a background condition, not an operative cause.
    *   **Check for Omissions:** An omission (a failure to act) may be a candidate only if there was a duty to act. Furthermore, an omission cannot be a cause if its putative effect was already guaranteed by a preempting event.
    *   **Check for Overdetermination:** This is rare. Only if two or more independent events were simultaneously sufficient to cause the outcome are both causes. Crucially, if candidates are asymmetric (e.g., one deviant, one normative), they are not overdetermined.

4.  **Test with a Focused Counterfactual (The Decisive Test):** For each candidate, ask: "If this specific candidate had been absent, *while holding all other events exactly as they were*, would the outcome have been determined to occur at that exact moment and in that exact way?" A genuine cause must make a difference to the actual occurrence. This test is definitive and overrides other considerations.

5.  **Conclude:** Finally, state your answer. The operative cause is usually the necessary, deviant event that passes the counterfactual test. Base your final answer on whether the question seeks a singular cause ("the cause") or any contributing factor ("a cause"). For "the cause," identify the primary deviant, operative cause.

Answer questions about causal attribution and intentionality by applying rigorous causal reasoning. Follow these steps precisely:

**1. Identify the Outcome, Cause, and Context:**
    *   **Outcome:** What is the specific event in question?
    *   **Alleged Cause:** What action/omission is being evaluated?
    *   **Context & Norms:** Identify any established rules, default states, standard procedures, or social norms that set expectations for behavior. Note any agent who is violating these norms.

**2. Determine the Triggering Condition:** Next, clarify the exact scenario that produces the outcome (e.g., "if two people are in the room").

**3. Apply Norm-Sensitive Counterfactual Reasoning:**
    *   First, establish the **default or normal course of events** if all agents followed the known rules or norms.
    *   Then ask: "Holding all other actions constant, **would the outcome have occurred if the alleged agent had acted normally/permissibly**?" This is different from "if they had not acted at all."

**4. Apply Standard Counterfactual Reasoning (But-For Test):** Subsequently, ask "Would the outcome have occurred if the agent's specific action had not been taken?" This establishes necessity.

**5. Check Sufficiency:** Furthermore, determine if the action/omission was sufficient by itself to cause the outcome.

**6. For Multiple Causes:** In cases of joint actions, determine if each action is necessary, sufficient, or both. For **overdetermination** (multiple sufficient causes), a cause is actual if it contributed. **Crucially, identify if one action was deviant (violating a norm) and another was normal.**

**7. For Omissions:** Note that only an omission by an agent who was *supposed to act* can be causal.

**8. For Intentionality:** An outcome is intentional **only if** the agent acted **with the purpose (aim, goal, or desire) of causing it** (direct intent). Importantly, merely knowing an outcome is certain or inevitable is **not sufficient** for intentionality in this context; it is a foreseen side effect.

**9. Synthesize for Proximate Cause & Responsibility:** Finally, determine if the alleged cause is the primary, direct, and responsible cause. Consider:
    *   **Directness:** Is the link direct?
    *   **Foreseeability:** Was the outcome a foreseeable consequence?
    *   **Deviance:** Was the agent's action a deviation from the normal or expected course of events? Causality is typically attributed to the deviant factor.
    *   **Intervening Causes:** Did a new, independent agent act to break the chain of causation?

**10. Final Attribution Check:** To conclude, if the agent was acting normally, permissibly, or in accordance with standard expectations, and the outcome was only caused because another agent created an abnormal condition, then the agent is **not** typically considered the cause. The cause is the agent who created the abnormal condition.

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying rigorous causal reasoning. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify the outcome and the alleged cause(s).**
2.  **Determine the precise triggering condition** for the outcome (i.e., the exact minimal set of facts required to produce the result).
    *   **Crucially, also identify the *normal, expected, or default* state of the system** against which the events unfolded. This baseline defines what was supposed to happen under standard conditions.
3.  **Apply normative counterfactual reasoning:** First, ask "Would the outcome have occurred if the system had operated *normally* (i.e., according to the default state)?" Then, ask: "What specific *deviation* from this normal state was required for the outcome?"
4.  **Check necessity (The Primary Criterion):** Determine if the action/omission was *necessary* for the outcome. This means that without it, the outcome would not have occurred.
5.  **Check abnormality (The Pragmatic Criterion):** Determine if the action/omission was a *deviation* from the normal, expected, or prescribed course of events. **For causal attribution, the cause is typically the *abnormal* or *deviant* necessary factor.**
6.  **Check sufficiency (Secondary):** Determine if the action/omission was *sufficient* to cause the outcome. Note that sufficiency is not required for causation.
7.  **For multiple causes:** In cases of joint necessity (e.g., two chemicals required for damage), the *deviant* necessary action is primary. In cases of overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes), an action is causal *only* if it was necessary in this specific instance.
8.  **For omissions:** An omission can only be causal if the agent had a *duty to act*, the inaction was necessary for the outcome, **and the omission was a deviation from the agent's normal duty.**
9.  **For intentionality:** When judging intent, consider the agent's *primary goal or desire*. An outcome is intentional **only if it was a goal of the action**, not merely a foreseen side-effect. Use the agent's own statements to determine their primary intent.
10. **Ignore irrelevant details:** Disregard personality traits, emotions, and other background context **UNLESS** they help establish what the *normal* or *expected* state of affairs is.
11. **Trace the causal chain:** Ensure there is a direct, unbroken link from the cause to the outcome.

**Critical Rule:** Base your judgment on whether the cause was both **necessary** for the outcome and a **deviation** from the normal/default state. If the action was part of the normal background (e.g., a permitted action, a standard process) and another *deviant* action was also necessary, attribute causation to the deviant action. If the outcome would have occurred anyway under normal operations, the action is not causal.

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Begin by determining the specific effect that requires explanation.
2.  **Identify Candidate Causes:** Next, list the events proposed as potential causes for this outcome.
3.  **Apply a Dual Test:** For each candidate, evaluate it by asking two questions:
    *   **Necessity (But-For Test):** "But for this event, would the outcome have occurred in the exact way it actually did?"
    *   **Sufficiency in Context:** "Was this event part of a set of conditions in the actual world that were sufficient to bring about the outcome?"
4.  **Evaluate Normative Role:** Then, determine if the candidate was a **normal/expected** background condition or a **deviant/abnormal** factor that disrupted the status quo. Cause is primarily attributed to deviant factors.
5.  **Handle Special Cases:**
    *   **Overdetermination:** If multiple factors are individually insufficient but jointly sufficient (e.g., two people triggering one detector), avoid attributing cause to a single individual; the cause is the collective action.
    *   **Causal Chains:** Identify the **proximate cause**—the most direct, foreseeable, and responsible agent. Independent, intervening actions (e.g., a crime) often break the chain of attribution for earlier events.
6.  **Reason from Actual Events:** Base your analysis strictly on the described sequence of events. The but-for test is a tool for establishing dependence within this actual sequence, not for speculative counterfactuals.
7.  **Conclude:** Finally, state your answer. A candidate is a cause if it was necessary, part of a sufficient set, and a deviant factor. If it was normal, not necessary, or not proximate, it is not a cause.

3.  **Apply the Sufficiency Test (Focus on Actual Events):** For each candidate, ask: "Was this event part of a set of conditions that were **actually sufficient** to bring about the outcome?" Base this **only on what actually happened**. Do not consider alternative scenarios or dismiss a candidate because the outcome might have occurred another way. A candidate does not need to be sufficient alone; it only needs to be part of a sufficient set in the actual scenario.
4.  **Check for Redundancy:** Then, assess whether a candidate was redundant—that is, if the sufficient set of conditions was already complete without it. In cases of overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes), no candidate is redundant. In cases of joint causation (multiple necessary events), no candidate is redundant.
5.  **Handle Multiple Causes:** If multiple candidates were each sufficient on their own, they are all causal (overdetermination). If multiple candidates were jointly sufficient and each was necessary, they are all causal (joint causation).
6.  **For Intentionality (if asked):** Only if specifically asked about intent, first determine if the agent's action was a cause. Then, check if the agent had knowledge and a desire to bring the outcome about.
7.  **Conclude:** Finally, state your final answer based on the analysis.

**Important:** Ignore normative rules (e.g., permissions, prohibitions). Focus solely on factual causation. Pay close attention to the narrative details to determine the actual sequence of events and conditions.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these steps:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Begin by determining the specific effect that requires explanation.
2.  **Identify Candidate Causes:** Next, list the events (including omissions, where relevant) that are proposed as potential causes.
3.  **Apply a Dual Test:** For each candidate, evaluate it by asking two questions:
    *   **Necessity (But-For Test):** "But for this event (or omission), would the outcome have occurred at the exact time and in the exact way it actually did?" **Base this strictly on the described sequence of events; avoid speculative counterfactuals.**
    *   **Sufficiency in Context:** "Was this event part of a set of conditions in the actual world that were sufficient to bring about the outcome?"
4.  **Evaluate Normative Role:** Then, determine if the candidate was a **normal/expected** background condition or a **deviant/abnormal** factor. **A deviant factor is often the primary cause of a negative outcome. However, a normal event can still be a cause if it passes the dual test and was the actual factor that produced the outcome. For omissions, evaluate if the agent had the ability and opportunity to prevent the outcome, regardless of formal responsibility.**
5.  **Handle Special Cases:** Apply the following principles to specific causal scenarios:
    *   **Overdetermination:** If multiple factors are individually sufficient, **both are causes.** The outcome occurred because of Candidate A *and* because of Candidate B. If one factor is deviant, it may be the primary cause for attribution of responsibility.
    *   **Causal Chains:** Identify the **proximate cause**—the most direct, foreseeable, and responsible agent. **Independent, intervening actions (especially deviant ones) break the chain of attribution for earlier events.**
    *   **Redundancy/Preemption:** If the outcome was already determined by an earlier, sufficient event, later events are not causes (they are redundant). **The earlier, pre-empting event is the cause.**
    *   **Omissions/Double Prevention:** If a candidate cause is an omission, check if the action would have prevented the outcome. If yes, then the omission is a necessary part of the causal chain.
6.  **Conclude:** Finally, synthesize your analysis. A candidate is a cause if it was **either necessary or sufficient in the actual sequence of events, and it was the event that actually brought about the outcome.** **Do not let the "normalcy" of an event automatically disqualify it from being a cause.** State your final answer.

1.  **Identify the outcome and the alleged cause(s).**
2.  **Determine the exact triggering condition** for the outcome (the minimal set of conditions that directly produces the result).
3.  **Apply counterfactual reasoning:** Explicitly ask "Would the outcome have occurred if the action had not been taken (or the omission had not happened)?" This is your primary test.
4.  **Check necessity:** Was the action/omission *necessary* for the outcome? If the outcome would have occurred anyway, the answer is **No**. This is the most important criterion.
5.  **Check sufficiency:** Was the action/omission *sufficient* to cause the outcome? This is informative but secondary to necessity.
6.  **For multiple causes:** Isolate the alleged cause. In cases of overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes), if the outcome was already guaranteed by a prior cause, a subsequent action is **not** necessary and therefore not causal.
7.  **For omissions:** Only an omission by an agent who was *explicitly supposed to act* (had a duty or assignment) can be causal. Apply the counterfactual: "If they *had* acted, would the outcome have been prevented?"
8.  **For intentionality:** Consider the agent's goals and knowledge only if they are part of the described causal chain. Do not let a lack of intent negate a causal link if the action was necessary.
9.  **Ignore irrelevant details:** Disregard permissions, probabilities, personality traits, or social norms that do not directly affect the causal chain. Focus only on the factual events that occurred.
10. **Trace the causal chain:** Verbally map the direct, unbroken link from the cause to the outcome. If the outcome was inevitable from a pre-existing condition, the alleged cause is not necessary.

**Your analysis must be grounded in these principles. Remember: necessity is paramount. An action/omission is a cause only if it was necessary for the outcome.**

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying rigorous causal reasoning that incorporates both logical necessity and everyday intuitive judgment. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify the Outcome and Alleged Cause(s):** Clearly state the specific result and the action or omission in question.
2.  **Establish the Causal Chain:** Next, map the direct, factual sequence of events from the alleged cause to the outcome.
3.  **Apply a Modified Counterfactual Test (Difference-Making):** Ask: "If the specific action had not occurred (or the omission had been fulfilled), would the outcome have been different in any **salient or important way**?" This includes being prevented, happening later, or happening due to a different, non-blameworthy cause.
4.  **Check for Normative Deviance (The "Abnormality" Test):** Crucially, identify if any event in the chain was a violation of a rule, policy, duty, or standard protocol. **This is a decisive factor.** In cases of overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes), causal responsibility is primarily attributed to the agent who acted abnormally or improperly, even if their action was not strictly necessary.
5.  **Check for Intervening Causes:** Subsequently, determine if the outcome was directly triggered by a subsequent, independent, and sufficient event that was not inevitable. Such an intervening cause may break the causal chain from a prior condition.
6.  **For Omissions:** An omission can be causal if:
    *   The agent had a **duty to act** (explicit or implicit based on role, promise, or prior action that created a risk), AND
    *   The counterfactual test is met: "If they *had* acted as expected, would the outcome have been prevented or significantly altered?"
7.  **For Intentionality:** To judge if an outcome was intentional, determine if the agent:
    *   **Knew** their action would lead to the outcome (or knew it was highly probable), AND
    *   **Aimed for it** (it was a goal or a means to a goal). Mere foresight of a side-effect is not sufficient for intentionality.
8.  **For Overdetermination:** If multiple sufficient causes exist, an action is not necessary for the outcome to occur. **However,** if one action violated a norm and the other did not, causal responsibility typically falls on the norm-violating actor.
9.  **Consider Narrative Salience:** Furthermore, analyze how the story frames the event. The outcome is often attributed to the most active, salient, or blameworthy factor presented in the narrative.
10. **Synthesize Your Analysis:** Finally, weigh the results. The difference-making test (Step 3) is primary for physical causality. The normative test (Step 4) is primary for assigning responsibility. Use narrative salience (Step 9) to inform your judgment. For intentionality, strictly apply the test in Step 7.
11. **Conclude:** Based on this synthesis, state your final answer. If the action was a salient difference-maker OR a norm-violating factor in an overdetermined scenario, the answer is likely **Yes**.

7.  **For Intentionality:** To judge if an outcome was intentional, determine if the agent:
    *   **Knew** their action would lead to the outcome (or knew it was highly probable), AND
    *   **Aimed for it** (it was a goal or a means to a goal). Mere foresight of a side-effect is not sufficient for intentionality.
8.  **For Overdetermination:** If multiple sufficient causes exist, an action is not necessary for the outcome to occur. **However,** if one action violated a norm and the other did not, causal responsibility typically falls on the norm-violating actor.
9.  **Consider Narrative Salience:** Furthermore, analyze how the story frames the event. The outcome is often attributed to the most active, salient, or blameworthy factor presented in the narrative.
10. **Synthesize Your Analysis:** Finally, weigh the results of the previous steps. The difference-making test (Step 3) is primary for physical causality. The normative test (Step 4) is primary for assigning responsibility. Use narrative salience (Step 9) to inform your judgment. For intentionality, strictly apply the test in Step 7.
11. **Conclude:** Based on this synthesis, state your final answer. If the action was a salient difference-maker OR a norm-violating factor in an overdetermined scenario, the answer is likely **Yes**.

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying rigorous causal reasoning. Follow these steps precisely and in order:

1.  **Identify the outcome and the alleged cause(s).** Define the outcome as a specific state change and the alleged cause as a specific action or omission.
2.  **Determine the exact, minimal triggering condition** for the outcome (the most direct, minimal set of conditions that actively produces the result).
3.  **Apply the counterfactual test for necessity (PARAMOUNT RULE):** Explicitly ask "Would the outcome have occurred if the action had not been taken (or the omission had not happened)?" **If the answer is 'Yes,' the alleged cause is NOT necessary, and your analysis is complete: the answer is No.**
4.  **Check for inevitability:** If the outcome was already guaranteed by a prior cause before the alleged cause occurred, then the alleged cause is **not** necessary.
5.  **Assess Causal Salience:** A cause must be both necessary *and* salient. Is the alleged cause the salient factor? Consider:
    *   **Abnormality:** Is it an abnormal, disruptive event or a normal, background condition? Background conditions are rarely "causes."
    *   **Intervening Cause:** Did a new, independent, voluntary, or highly abnormal act occur after the alleged cause that directly triggered the outcome? If yes, this intervening cause likely supersedes the alleged cause.
6.  **For omissions:** An omission can be causal **only if** the agent had a duty to act (based on role, ownership, or commitment) **OR** if their own prior actions created the situation. Apply the counterfactual: "If they *had* acted, would the outcome have been prevented?"
7.  **Isolate the alleged cause:** Focus strictly on the specific entity named in the question. Ignore the collective actions of others.
8.  **Ignore irrelevant details:** **RUTHLESSLY DISREGARD** the agent's knowledge, intent (unless the question is explicitly about intent), moral blameworthiness, probabilities, social norms, rules, or laws. Focus solely on the factual events in the causal chain.
9.  **Trace the causal chain:** Verbally map the direct link from the cause to the outcome. **Always restate the counterfactual and salience assessment to confirm your reasoning.**

**Your analysis must be grounded in these principles. Remember: necessity is the paramount rule, but it must be paired with causal salience.**

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying rigorous causal reasoning. First, classify the question's type: is it primarily about physical causation, intentionality, or agent attribution? Then, follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify the outcome and the alleged cause(s).** Determine the question's scope: is it asking about the cause of the outcome in general, or the cause of the *specific instance*? Note if the question is about a mental state like 'intention'.

2.  **Determine the exact triggering condition** for the specific outcome (the minimal set of conditions that directly produced the result).

3.  **Apply counterfactual reasoning for the proximate cause:** Ask "Would the specific outcome have occurred *at the time and in the way it did* if the alleged cause had not been present?"

4.  **Check necessity:** Was the action/omission *necessary* for the outcome? If the outcome would have occurred anyway at that moment due to a pre-existing, sufficient condition (preemption), this suggests **No** for attribution.

5.  **Check sufficiency:** Was the action/omission *sufficient* to cause the outcome? If yes, it is a strong candidate for being *a* cause.

6.  **For multiple causes:**
    *   **Preemption:** If a prior cause had already made the outcome inevitable, a subsequent action is **not** a cause. (e.g., Poison kills victim before bullet hits).
    *   **Simultaneous Overdetermination:** If multiple sufficient causes act at the *exact same time* (e.g., two trains hitting a bridge at once, two people arriving at the same time), then **each is considered a cause. Your answer must be 'Yes' for each sufficient cause in these scenarios.**

7.  **Identify normative deviations and defaults:** This is crucial. The cause is often the factor that deviates from what is normal, expected, or prescribed.
    *   An action according to plan/duty is less likely to be "the cause."
    *   **An action that changes the state of the world from a default (non-outcome) state to an outcome state is very likely to be a cause, even if other actions could have done it.**
    *   Use this to interpret the question's intent. **In cases of conflict, normative deviation often overrides a strict necessity test for attribution questions.**

8.  **For omissions:** Only an omission by an agent who was *explicitly supposed to act* (had a duty or assignment) can be causal. Apply the counterfactual: "If they *had* acted, would the outcome have been prevented?"

9.  **For intentionality:** **If the question asks about 'intention', apply the following:**
    *   An agent intends an outcome if it is their goal or purpose.
    *   **An agent also intends a foreseen side-effect if they know it is certain to result from their action, even if it is not their goal.**

10. **Trace the causal chain:** Map the link from the cause to the outcome. **Prioritize identifying the proximate cause.**

**Synthesizing Your Analysis:**
**Your final answer must balance these principles. For questions about agent attribution:**
*   **If the case involves simultaneous overdetermination (Step 6), the answer is 'Yes'.**
*   **If the agent's action was a deviation from a norm or default that brought about the outcome (Step 7), the answer is 'Yes'.**
*   **Do not let a lack of strict necessity (Step 4) override these principles in attribution contexts.** Necessity is most important for identifying preemption.

e the counterfactual test.**
    *   Apply a two-prong test:
        1.  **Desire/Goal:** "Did the agent perform the action *with the specific goal or desire* of bringing about the outcome in question?"
        2.  **Awareness/Foresight:** "Was the agent *aware* that their action could bring about this outcome?"
    *   **Key Invariants:**
        *   **Awareness is Necessary:** An agent cannot intend an outcome they are unaware of.
        *   **Desire is Key:** Foresight or certainty alone is not sufficient for intention. The outcome must be part of the agent's reason for acting. An agent can be aware of a consequence without intending it.

*   **For Moral/Legal Responsibility:**
    *   **First,** establish physical causation using the counterfactual test from the framework above.
    *   **Then,** and only then, analyze blameworthiness. Ask: "Was the outcome a **foreseeable** consequence of the action? Did the agent have a **duty** to act differently? Do mitigating factors (e.g., fixed personality traits) absolve them of fault?"
    *   **Key Principle:** An agent can be the cause of an outcome without being morally responsible for it.

**Step 3: Synthesize your conclusion.** Based strictly on the analysis above, conclude with a definitive "Yes" or "No".

Ensure your response is logically structured around this analysis. Use cohesive devices to link your reasoning steps clearly. Your final output must be the XML tag `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these steps:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Determine the specific effect that requires explanation.
2.  **Identify Candidate Causes:** List the events proposed as potential causes for this outcome.
3.  **Apply the Sufficiency Test (Actual Events Only):** For each candidate, ask: "Was this event part of a set of conditions that were **sufficient** to bring about the outcome **in the actual circumstances**?"
    - **Focus on actual events:** Do not consider "what if" scenarios or dismiss a candidate because the outcome might have happened another way.
    - **Necessity is not required:** A candidate is a cause if it was sufficient, even if it was not necessary for the outcome.
    - **Combination of factors:** If the outcome requires a combination of events, each event in that sufficient combination is a cause.
    - **Overdetermination is allowed:** Multiple sufficient candidates that all occurred are all causes.
4.  **Ignore Irrelevant Factors:** Disregard background conditions, personality traits, or questions of moral/contractual responsibility. Focus solely on causal sufficiency in the actual event chain.
5.  **Conclude:** State your answer based on the preceding analysis. The conclusion must be a direct "yes" or "no" for each candidate, determined strictly by the sufficiency test applied to the scenario's exact details.

5.  **Handle Multiple Causes:** If multiple candidates were each sufficient on their own, they are all causal (overdetermination).
6.  **For Intentionality (if asked):** If the question is about whether an outcome was brought about "intentionally," first determine if the agent's action was a cause. Then, check if the agent had knowledge that the outcome would occur and a desire or purpose to bring it about.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these steps:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Determine the specific effect that requires explanation.
2.  **Identify Candidate Causes:** List the events (not dispositional traits or background conditions) proposed as potential causes.
3.  **Apply a Dual Test:** For each candidate, evaluate it by asking:
    *   **Necessity (But-For Test):** "But for this event, would the outcome have occurred in the exact way it actually did?" **Base this strictly on the described sequence of events; avoid speculative counterfactuals.**
    *   **Sufficiency in Context:** "Was this event part of a set of conditions in the actual world that were sufficient to bring about the outcome?"
4.  **Evaluate Normative Role:** Determine if the candidate was a **normal/expected** background condition or a **deviant/abnormal** factor. **Cause is primarily attributed to deviant factors. A normal candidate is not a cause, even if necessary and sufficient.**
5.  **Handle Special Cases:**
    *   **Overdetermination:** If multiple factors are individually insufficient but jointly sufficient, avoid attributing cause to a single individual; the cause is the collective action or the conjunction. If one factor is deviant, it may be the cause.
    *   **Causal Chains:** Identify the **proximate cause**—the most direct, foreseeable, and responsible agent. **Independent, intervening actions (especially deviant ones) break the chain of attribution for earlier events.**
    *   **Redundancy/Preemption:** If the outcome was already determined by an earlier event, later events are not causes, even if they would have been sufficient alone.
6.  **Conclude:** A candidate is a cause only if it was necessary, part of a sufficient set, and a deviant factor. State your final answer.

In overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes), no candidate is redundant. In joint causation (multiple necessary events), no candidate is redundant.
5.  **Handle Multiple Causes:** If multiple candidates were each sufficient on their own, they are all causal (overdetermination). If multiple candidates were jointly sufficient and each was necessary, they are all causal (joint causation).

our answers so each step logically and seamlessly flows into the next. Use appropriate cohesive devices to link sentences and paragraphs, thereby enhancing readability and clarity. Crucially, maintain the original meaning, block order, and formatting in your answers.

**Your reasoning process must follow these steps:**

0.  **Establish the Outcome:** First, clearly state the specific outcome mentioned in the question.
1.  **Reconstruct the Causal Chain:** Concisely summarize the sequence of events, identifying all relevant actions, omissions, and conditions.
2.  **Perform a Counterfactual Analysis:** This is the most critical step. Ask and answer the key question: "If the specific action in question had NOT occurred, would the outcome still have happened in the exact same way?" Analyze what the most likely scenario would be without that action.
    *   If the outcome would **not** have occurred, then the action is a cause.
    *   If the outcome **would** have occurred anyway, then the action is not a cause.
3.  **Identify Causal Contributors:** Based on the counterfactual, isolate the actions or omissions that were necessary for the outcome. Recognize that there can be multiple contributing causes.
4.  **Analyze Proximity and Dependence:** Briefly analyze if the action was a direct and proximate link in the chain, or if the outcome depended on many independent, intervening factors.
5.  **Separate Causation from Responsibility:** Conclude whether the action can be attributed as a cause. Remember: an action can be a cause even if the actor did not intend the outcome, could not foresee it, or was not morally responsible for it. Causation is a separate question from blame.

Use this framework to guide your response, employing transitional phrases to connect each step and maintain a coherent argument throughout. Let the counterfactual analysis (Step 2) be the primary driver of your conclusion.

Answer questions about causal attribution. Adhere strictly to the following reasoning process:

1.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test (Difference-Making):** This is the primary test. For an event X to be a cause of outcome Y, ask: **"If X had NOT occurred, would Y still have occurred in the exact same way?"**
    *   If the answer is **"no"** (the outcome would have been different or would not have occurred), then X is a cause.
    *   If the answer is **"yes"** (the outcome would have been identical), then X is **not** a cause. Proceed to step 2 only if this test is inconclusive or involves multiple actors.

2.  **Handle Redundant Causes (Overdetermination & Pre-emption):** If the counterfactual test suggests that multiple events were not necessary (e.g., two sufficient events occurred), determine if one cause **pre-empted** the other.
    *   A pre-empting cause is one that already secures the outcome before another sufficient cause acts. The pre-empting cause is the primary cause; the subsequent redundant actions are not causes.
    *   In cases of **symmetric overdetermination** (two identical causes happen at the same time), if *all* causes are redundant (the outcome would have happened even if any one was removed), then they are **not** considered individual causes. The cause is the general set of conditions.

3.  **Consider Omissions Strictly:** Treat the omission of an action (not doing something) as a potential cause **only** if it passes the counterfactual test: **"If the agent HAD performed the omitted action, would the outcome have been different?"**
    *   If "yes," then the omission is a cause.
    *   Do not consider the agent's responsibilities, obligations, or intentions. Focus solely on the physical consequence of the action itself.

4.  **Structure Your Answer:** After your analysis, provide a final "yes" or "no" answer within the tags `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.

Ensure your response is characterized by strong linguistic cohesion and smooth transitions between these analytical points. The counterfactual test (Step 1) is the most important. Carefully structure your answer to guarantee a logical and seamless flow from one point to the next, using appropriate cohesive devices to link sentences and paragraphs, thereby enhancing readability and clarity. Crucially, you must maintain the original meaning, block order, and formatting of the provided text in your answers.

Answer questions about causal attribution by first classifying the question and then applying the appropriate reasoning framework. Follow these steps rigorously:

**Step 0: Classify the Question Type.**
Analyze the query to determine if it is primarily about:
*   **Physical Causation:** The question asks "did X cause Y?" focusing solely on the chain of events.
*   **Intention:** The question uses keywords like "intentionally," "knowingly," "on purpose," or "accidentally." This requires analyzing the agent's mental state and goals.
*   **Moral/Legal Responsibility:** The context emphasizes motives, personality traits, fault, or blameworthiness. This asks if the agent is to be held accountable, which is distinct from being a cause.

**Step 1: Identify the specific action or inaction in question.** Isolate the exact event being evaluated.

**Step 2: Apply the appropriate analysis based on the question type from Step 0.**

*   **For Physical Causation:**
    *   Apply the **counterfactual test for actual causation:** Mentally construct a world that is **identical to the actual world in all respects up until the moment of the action/inaction in question.** In this world, the *only* difference is that the specific action/inaction is altered. Determine if the outcome would have been different.
    *   **Guidance for Complex Cases:** If the outcome would have occurred via a different sufficient pathway, the action may not be the actual cause. If an independent, intervening event (e.g., a drunk driver) is the primary cause, the original action may not be the proximate cause.

*   **For Intention:**
    *   **Ignore the counterfactual test for causation.** Instead, analyze the agent's mental state.
    *   Ask: "Did the agent perform the action *with the specific goal or desire* of bringing about the outcome in question?"
    *   An action can cause an outcome without the intention behind it.

*   **For Moral/Legal Responsibility:**
    *   First, establish physical causation using the counterfactual test.
    *   Then, analyze blameworthiness. Ask: "Was the outcome a **foreseeable** consequence of the action? Did the agent have a **duty** to act differently? Do mitigating factors (e.g., fixed personality traits) absolve them of fault?"
    *   An agent can be the cause of an outcome without being morally responsible for it, and vice-versa.

**Step 3: Synthesize your conclusion.** Based strictly on the analysis above, conclude with a definitive "Yes" or "No".

Ensure your response is logically structured around this analysis. Use cohesive devices to link your reasoning steps clearly. Your final output must be the XML tag `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following a structured reasoning process. Your primary goal is to determine if an action was a cause of an outcome. Carefully structure your answers so each step logically and seamlessly flows into the next. Use appropriate cohesive devices to link sentences and paragraphs, thereby enhancing readability and clarity. Crucially, maintain the original meaning, block order, and formatting in your answers.

**Your reasoning process must follow these steps:**

0.  **Parse the Question & Identify the Normative Baseline:** First, identify if the question is about causation ("cause", "because") or about intent/responsibility ("intentionally", "blame", "responsible"). Then, critically, identify the **normative baseline**: what was the expected, normal, or prescribed course of events? Identify any actions that **deviate** from this baseline (e.g., violations of instructions, unusual accidents, or negligent acts). If the question is about intent, note that you will first establish causation, but your final conclusion must analyze the actor's mental state (desire, knowledge, goals).
1.  **Establish the Outcome:** Clearly state the specific outcome mentioned in the question.
2.  **Reconstruct the Causal Chain:** Concisely summarize the sequence of events in order, identifying all relevant actions, omissions, and pre-existing conditions. Annotate which events were normal and which were deviant relative to the baseline.
3.  **Perform a Dual Counterfactual Analysis (The Primary Tool):** This step is crucial. You must ask and answer **TWO** key questions:
    *   **a) The Necessity (But-For) Test:** "If the specific action in question had NOT occurred, would the outcome still have happened in the *exact same way* at the *exact same time*?"
    *   **b) The Sufficiency Test:** "Was the action itself a **sufficient** condition for the outcome (or a necessary part of a sufficient set) given the circumstances, and did it **actually occur**?"
4.  **Integrate Tests and Apply the Norms:** Synthesize the answers from Step 3 with the normative analysis from Step 0.
    *   If the action was **deviant** and **necessary** (fails the but-for test), it is a cause.
    *   If the action was **deviant** and **sufficient** (passes the sufficiency test, even if not necessary as in cases of overdetermination), it is a cause.
    *   If the action was **normal** and necessary, it is often considered a background condition rather than the salient cause. The cause is the **deviant** factor that broke the normal process.
    *   If a subsequent, highly abnormal, and independent event (an **intervening cause**) occurs, it can supersede a prior necessary cause, breaking the chain of causation.
5.  **State Causal Conclusion:** Conclude by stating whether the action can be attributed as a cause. **Remember: an action can be a cause (a mechanical fact) even if the actor did not intend the outcome, could not foresee it, or was not morally responsible for it.** If the question was about intent, use your causal finding and then analyze the actor's mental state separately to answer it.

**Critical Reasoning Invariants:**
1.  **Counterfactuals are Key, but Not Absolute:** The but-for test is a primary tool, but not the only one. The sufficiency test and normative analysis are equally important.
2.  **Deviance is Causation:** Often, the cause is the abnormal event that disrupted the normal course of events.
3.  **An Intervening Cause Can Break the Chain:** A voluntary, negligent, or highly abnormal act that occurs after the initial action can become the sole proximate cause, negating a remote, necessary cause.
4.  **Causation ≠ Blame, but Norms ≠ Blame:** Ignore moral blame, but **do not ignore** factual norms, defaults, and instructions. They are essential for determining which event was the true "cause."
5.  **Multiple Causes are Possible:** An outcome can have more than one cause. Judge if the action in question was one of them based on necessity, sufficiency, and deviance.

Use this framework to guide your response, employing transitional phrases to connect each step and maintain a coherent argument throughout. Let the integrated counterfactual and normative analysis (Step 3 & 4) be the primary driver of your conclusion.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these steps:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Determine the specific effect that requires explanation.
2.  **Identify Candidate Causes:** List the events proposed as potential causes for this outcome.
3.  **Apply a Dual Test:** For each candidate, evaluate it by asking:
    *   **Necessity (But-For Test):** "But for this event, would the outcome have occurred in the exact way it actually did?"
    *   **Sufficiency in Context:** "Was this event part of a set of conditions in the actual world that were sufficient to bring about the outcome?"
4.  **Evaluate Normative Role:** Determine if the candidate was a **normal/expected** background condition or a **deviant/abnormal** factor that disrupted the status quo. Cause is primarily attributed to deviant factors.
5.  **Handle Special Cases:**
    *   **Overdetermination:** If multiple factors are individually insufficient but jointly sufficient (e.g., two people triggering one detector), avoid attributing cause to a single individual; the cause is the collective action.
    *   **Causal Chains:** Identify the **proximate cause**—the most direct, foreseeable, and responsible agent. Independent, intervening actions (e.g., a crime) often break the chain of attribution for earlier events.
6.  **Reason from Actual Events:** Base your analysis strictly on the described sequence of events. The but-for test is a tool for establishing dependence within this actual sequence, not for speculative counterfactuals.
7.  **Conclude:** State your answer. A candidate is a cause if it was necessary, part of a sufficient set, and a deviant factor. If it was normal, not necessary, or not proximate, it is not a cause.

Answer questions about causal attribution and intentionality by following these steps:

1.  **Identify the Outcome and Action:** Determine the specific effect in question and the agent's relevant action.

2.  **Determine the Question Type:**
    *   If the question is about **intentionality** (e.g., "did X intentionally cause Y?"), proceed to Step 3.
    *   If the question is about **causal attribution** (e.g., "did X cause Y?"), proceed to Step 4.

3.  **Test for Intentionality:** An agent intentionally causes an outcome if and only if:
    *   **Desire:** The outcome was a goal or desired end of the agent's action.
    *   **Belief:** The agent acted because they believed their action would achieve that outcome.
    *   **Key Exception:** An outcome is **not** intentional if it was merely a foreseen but undesired side-effect of pursuing a different goal (even if the agent was aware it would occur).

4.  **Test for Causal Attribution:** A candidate event is a cause of the outcome if:
    *   **Counterfactual Dependence:** The outcome would **not** have occurred at the same time and in the same way if the candidate event had not happened.
    *   **Note on Overdetermination:** If multiple sufficient causes exist (e.g., two shooters), a candidate is still a cause even if the outcome would have happened from another source, unless the candidate's action was rendered causally redundant *in the actual scenario* (e.g., the outcome was already guaranteed by another event at the moment the candidate acted).

5.  **Conclude:** State a direct "yes" or "no" for each candidate, based strictly on the test applied in the previous step. Disregard background conditions, personality traits, or general questions of responsibility; focus only on the specific causal or intentional relationship.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these steps:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Determine the specific effect that requires explanation.
2.  **Identify Candidate Causes:** List the events (including omissions, where relevant) proposed as potential causes.
3.  **Apply a Dual Test:** For each candidate, evaluate it by asking:
    *   **Necessity (But-For Test):** "But for this event (or omission), would the outcome have occurred at the exact time and in the exact way it actually did?" **Base this strictly on the described sequence of events; avoid speculative counterfactuals.**
    *   **Sufficiency in Context:** "Was this event part of a set of conditions in the actual world that were sufficient to bring about the outcome?"
4.  **Evaluate Normative Role:** Determine if the candidate was a **normal/expected** background condition or a **deviant/abnormal** factor. **A deviant factor is often the primary cause of a negative outcome. However, a normal event can still be a cause if it passes the dual test and was the actual factor that produced the outcome. For omissions, evaluate if the agent had the ability and opportunity to prevent the outcome, regardless of formal responsibility.**
5.  **Handle Special Cases:**
    *   **Overdetermination:** If multiple factors are individually sufficient, **both are causes.** The outcome occurred because of Candidate A *and* because of Candidate B. If one factor is deviant, it may be the primary cause for attribution of responsibility.
    *   **Causal Chains:** Identify the **proximate cause**—the most direct, foreseeable, and responsible agent. **Independent, intervening actions (especially deviant ones) break the chain of attribution for earlier events.**
    *   **Redundancy/Preemption:** If the outcome was already determined by an earlier, sufficient event, later events are not causes (they are redundant). **The earlier, pre-empting event is the cause.**
    *   **Omissions/Double Prevention:** If a candidate cause is an omission, check if the action would have prevented the outcome. If yes, then the omission is a necessary part of the causal chain.
6.  **Conclude:** A candidate is a cause if it was **either necessary or sufficient in the actual sequence of events, and it was the event that actually brought about the outcome.** **Do not let the "normalcy" of an event automatically disqualify it from being a cause.** State your final answer.

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying rigorous causal reasoning. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify the Outcome and Alleged Cause(s):** Clearly state the specific result and the action or omission in question.
2.  **Establish the Causal Chain:** Map the direct, factual sequence of events from the alleged cause to the outcome.
3.  **Apply Counterfactual Reasoning (Necessity Test):** Ask: "Would the outcome have occurred **in the exact same way and at the exact same time** if the alleged action had not been taken or the omission had been fulfilled?" This is your primary test.
    *   **If the answer is NO,** the action/omission was likely a cause. Proceed to step 4.
    *   **If the answer is YES,** the action/omission was not necessary and therefore not a cause. Your answer is **No**.
4.  **Check for Normative Deviance (The "Abnormality" Test):** Identify if any event in the chain was a violation of a rule, policy, duty, or standard protocol. Causation is often attributed to the most *abnormal* or *improper* factor. If the alleged cause was a normal, proper action and another agent's deviant action was also necessary, the deviant action is typically the primary cause.
5.  **Check for Intervening Causes:** Determine if the outcome was directly triggered by a subsequent, independent, and sufficient event that was not inevitable. Such an intervening cause may break the causal chain from a prior condition.
6.  **For Omissions:** An omission can be causal if:
    *   The agent had a **duty to act** (explicit or implicit based on role, promise, or prior action that created a risk), AND
    *   The counterfactual test is met: "If they *had* acted as expected, would the outcome have been prevented?"
7.  **For Intentionality:** To judge if an outcome was intentional, determine if the agent:
    *   **Knew** their action would lead to the outcome (or knew it was highly probable), AND
    *   **Proceeded regardless** (this establishes conditional intent).
8.  **For Overdetermination:** If multiple sufficient causes exist, an action is not necessary if the outcome was guaranteed by another cause. **However,** if one action violated a norm and the other did not, causal responsibility typically falls on the norm-violating actor.
9.  **Synthesize Your Analysis:** Weigh the results of the necessity test (Step 3) against the normality test (Step 4) and the rules for interventions, omissions, and intent. The necessity test is paramount, but normative factors can override attribution when necessity is shared.
10. **Conclude:** Based on this synthesis, state your final answer.

**Always conclude with a final answer inside <answer> tags: <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.**

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying rigorous causal reasoning that incorporates both logical necessity and everyday intuitive judgment. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify the Outcome and Alleged Cause(s):** Clearly state the specific result and the action or omission in question.
2.  **Establish the Causal Chain:** Map the direct, factual sequence of events from the alleged cause to the outcome.
3.  **Apply a Modified Counterfactual Test (Difference-Making):** Ask: "If the specific action had not occurred (or the omission had been fulfilled), would the outcome have been different in any **salient or important way**?" This includes being prevented, happening later, or happening due to a different, non-blameworthy cause.
4.  **Check for Normative Deviance (The "Abnormality" Test):** Identify if any event in the chain was a violation of a rule, policy, duty, or standard protocol. **This is a decisive factor.** In cases of overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes), causal responsibility is primarily attributed to the agent who acted abnormally or improperly, even if their action was not strictly necessary.
5.  **Check for Intervening Causes:** Determine if the outcome was directly triggered by a subsequent, independent, and sufficient event that was not inevitable. Such an intervening cause may break the causal chain from a prior condition.
6.  **For Omissions:** An omission can be causal if:
    *   The agent had a **duty to act** (explicit or implicit based on role, promise, or prior action that created a risk), AND
    *   The counterfactual test is met: "If they *had* acted as expected, would the outcome have been prevented or significantly altered?"
7.  **For Intentionality:** To judge if an outcome was intentional, determine if the agent:
    *   **Knew** their action would lead to the outcome (or knew it was highly probable), AND
    *   **Aimed for it** (it was a goal or a means to a goal). Mere foresight of a side-effect is not sufficient for intentionality.
8.  **For Overdetermination:** If multiple sufficient causes exist, an action is not necessary for the outcome to occur. **However,** if one action violated a norm and the other did not, causal responsibility typically falls on the norm-violating actor.
9.  **Consider Narrative Salience:** Analyze how the story frames the event. The outcome is often attributed to the most active, salient, or blameworthy factor presented in the narrative.
10. **Synthesize Your Analysis:** Weigh the results. The difference-making test (Step 3) is primary for physical causality. The normative test (Step 4) is primary for assigning responsibility. Use narrative salience (Step 9) to inform your judgment. For intentionality, strictly apply the test in Step 7.
11. **Conclude:** Based on this synthesis, state your final answer. If the action was a salient difference-maker OR a norm-violating factor in an overdetermined scenario, the answer is likely **Yes**.

**Always conclude with a final answer inside <answer> tags: <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.**

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying rigorous causal reasoning. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify the outcome and the alleged cause(s).** First, determine the question's scope: is it asking about the cause of the outcome in general, or the cause of the *specific instance* that occurred?
2.  **Determine the exact triggering condition** for the specific outcome (the minimal set of conditions that directly produced the result).
3.  **Apply counterfactual reasoning for the proximate cause:** Ask "Would the specific outcome have occurred *at the time and in the way it did* if the alleged cause had not been present?"
4.  **Check necessity:** Was the action/omission *necessary* for the outcome? If the outcome would have occurred anyway at that moment due to a pre-existing, sufficient condition (preemption), the answer is **No**.
5.  **Check sufficiency:** Was the action/omission *sufficient* to cause the outcome?
6.  **For multiple causes:**
    *   **Preemption:** If a prior cause had already made the outcome inevitable, a subsequent action is **not** a cause.
    *   **Simultaneous Overdetermination:** If multiple sufficient causes act at the same time (e.g., two trains hitting a bridge at once), then **each is considered a cause**.
7.  **Identify normative deviations:** The cause is often the factor that deviates from what is normal, expected, or prescribed. An action that is according to plan, duty, or design is less likely to be selected as "the cause" than a faulty,意外, or forbidden action. Use this to interpret the question's intent.
8.  **For omissions:** Only an omission by an agent who was *explicitly supposed to act* (had a duty or assignment) can be causal. Apply the counterfactual: "If they *had* acted, would the outcome have been prevented?"
9.  **For intentionality:** Consider the agent's goals and knowledge only if they are part of the described causal chain. Do not let a lack of intent negate a causal link if the action was necessary.
10. **Trace the causal chain:** Map the link from the cause to the outcome. **Prioritize identifying the proximate cause** (the most direct trigger) for the specific event.

**Your analysis must balance these principles. While necessity is key for preemption, sufficiency and normative deviation are crucial for simultaneous causation and human attribution.**

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying rigorous causal reasoning. Follow these steps precisely and in order:

1.  **Identify the outcome and the alleged cause(s).** Be specific. Define the outcome as a specific state change (e.g., "the injury") and the alleged cause as a specific action or omission.
2.  **Determine the exact triggering condition** for the outcome (the most direct, minimal set of conditions that actively produces the result).
3.  **Apply counterfactual reasoning:** Explicitly ask "Would the outcome have occurred if the action had not been taken (or the omission had not happened)?" This is your primary test for necessity.
4.  **Assess Causal Salience:** Is the alleged cause the salient factor? Consider:
    *   **Intervening Cause:** Did a new, independent, voluntary, or highly abnormal act occur after the alleged cause that directly triggered the outcome? (e.g., a drunk driver crashing). If yes, this intervening cause likely supersedes the alleged cause.
    *   **Normality:** Is the alleged cause a normal, background condition or an abnormal, disruptive event? Background conditions are rarely labeled as "causes" even if necessary.
5.  **Check necessity (paramount rule):** Was the action/omission *necessary* for the outcome? If the outcome would have been produced by an intervening cause regardless, the answer is **No**. An action/omission is a cause **ONLY** if it was necessary **and** salient.
6.  **Check sufficiency:** Was the action/omission *sufficient* to cause the outcome? This is informative but secondary to necessity and salience.
7.  **For multiple causes:** Isolate the alleged cause. **Ask: "Was the outcome inevitable before the alleged cause occurred?"** If it was already guaranteed by a prior, salient cause, a subsequent action is **not** necessary and therefore not causal.
8.  **For omissions:** An omission can be causal **only if the agent had a duty to act (explicit or implicit based on role, ownership, or prior commitment) OR if their own prior actions created the situation.** Apply the counterfactual: "If they *had* acted, would the outcome have been prevented?" **If there is no such duty or prior action, the omission is not causal.**
9.  **For intentionality:** If the question is about intent, first determine if the action was causal using the steps above. **A lack of intent does not negate a causal link.** Then, for intent, consider if the agent aimed to achieve the outcome with their causal action.
10. **Ignore irrelevant details:** **Disregard the agent's knowledge, intent (unless asked), moral blameworthiness, probabilities, or social norms unless the question is explicitly about those concepts.** Focus only on the factual events in the causal chain.
11. **Trace the causal chain:** Verbally map the direct, unbroken link from the cause to the outcome. **Always restate the counterfactual and salience assessment to confirm your reasoning.**

**Your analysis must be grounded in these principles. Remember: necessity is paramount, but it must be paired with causal salience.**
**Always conclude with a final answer inside <answer> tags: <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.**

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying rigorous causal reasoning. First, classify the question's type: is it primarily about physical causation, intentionality, or agent attribution? Then, follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify the outcome and the alleged cause(s).** Determine the question's scope: is it asking about the cause of the outcome in general, or the cause of the *specific instance*? Note if the question is about a mental state like 'intention'.

2.  **Determine the exact triggering condition** for the specific outcome (the minimal set of conditions that directly produced the result).

3.  **Apply counterfactual reasoning for the proximate cause:** Ask "Would the specific outcome have occurred *at the time and in the way it did* if the alleged cause had not been present?"

4.  **Check necessity:** Was the action/omission *necessary* for the outcome? If the outcome would have occurred anyway at that moment due to a pre-existing, sufficient condition (preemption), this suggests **No** for attribution.

5.  **Check sufficiency:** Was the action/omission *sufficient* to cause the outcome? If yes, it is a strong candidate for being *a* cause.

6.  **For multiple causes:**
    *   **Preemption:** If a prior cause had already made the outcome inevitable, a subsequent action is **not** a cause. (e.g., Poison kills victim before bullet hits).
    *   **Simultaneous Overdetermination:** If multiple sufficient causes act at the *exact same time* (e.g., two trains hitting a bridge at once, two people arriving at the same time), then **each is considered a cause. Your answer must be 'Yes' for each sufficient cause in these scenarios.**

7.  **Identify normative deviations and defaults:** This is crucial. The cause is often the factor that deviates from what is normal, expected, or prescribed.
    *   An action according to plan/duty is less likely to be "the cause."
    *   **An action that changes the state of the world from a default (non-outcome) state to an outcome state is very likely to be a cause, even if other actions could have done it.**
    *   Use this to interpret the question's intent. **In cases of conflict, normative deviation often overrides a strict necessity test for attribution questions.**

8.  **For omissions:** Only an omission by an agent who was *explicitly supposed to act* (had a duty or assignment) can be causal. Apply the counterfactual: "If they *had* acted, would the outcome have been prevented?"

9.  **For intentionality:** **If the question asks about 'intention', apply the following:**
    *   An agent intends an outcome if it is their goal or purpose.
    *   **An agent also intends a foreseen side-effect if they know it is certain to result from their action, even if it is not their goal.**

10. **Trace the causal chain:** Map the link from the cause to the outcome. **Prioritize identifying the proximate cause.**

**Synthesizing Your Analysis:**
**Your final answer must balance these principles. For questions about agent attribution:**
*   **If the case involves simultaneous overdetermination (Step 6), the answer is 'Yes'.**
*   **If the agent's action was a deviation from a norm or default that brought about the outcome (Step 7), the answer is 'Yes'.**
*   **Do not let a lack of strict necessity (Step 4) override these principles in attribution contexts.** Necessity is most important for identifying preemption.

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying a rigorous, step-by-step causal analysis. Your goal is to determine if the specified action was a salient cause, not just a necessary condition.

**Follow this reasoning process:**

1.  **Identify the outcome and the potential cause.**
2.  **Determine the necessary and sufficient conditions** for the outcome to occur.
3.  **Apply the "but-for" test for necessity:** Ask, "Would the outcome have occurred *if the specific action had not been taken* (or if the omission had been acted upon)?"
    -   If the outcome would *not* have occurred, the action is a **necessary condition**. Proceed to the next step.
    -   If the outcome *would* have occurred, it is not a cause. Conclude **No**.
4.  **Evaluate the causal structure for overdetermination:**
    -   **Symmetric Overdetermination:** If the outcome required multiple identical, simultaneous factors (e.g., two people arriving), and the potential cause is one of them, then it is **not** a salient cause. The cause is the collective set. Conclude **No**.
    -   **Asymmetric Overdetermination:** If multiple independent factors were sufficient on their own, the action is only a cause if it was the one that actually occurred.

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying a rigorous, step-by-step causal analysis. Your goal is to determine if the specified action was a salient cause.

**Follow this reasoning process:**

1.  **Identify the Outcome and the Potential Cause.**
    *   Precisely define the outcome event.
    *   Precisely define the alleged causal event (action or omission), considering the full sequence of events and any normative context (e.g., rules, duties, intentions if the question involves intentionality).

2.  **Establish the Causal Structure.**
    *   Determine the **necessary and sufficient conditions** for the outcome.
    *   Map out all potential pathways that could lead to the outcome.

3.  **Apply the "But-For" Test for Necessity.**
    *   Ask: "Would the outcome have occurred *at the precise time and in the precise way that it did* if the specific action had not been taken (or if the omission had been acted upon)?"
    *   **â†’ If NO,** the action/omission was a **necessary condition**. Proceed to Step 4.
    *   **â†’ If YES,** it is not a necessary condition. Proceed to Step 5.

4.  **Evaluate Causal Salience for Necessary Factors.**
    *   **For Omissions:** An omission is salient only if the agent had a **duty to act** and the action would have been sufficient to prevent the outcome. If so, it is a cause. Conclude **Yes**.
    *   **For Actions:** A necessary action is a salient cause unless it is a **purely background condition** (a constant, unchanging state with no agency, e.g., gravity). This exception almost never applies to deliberate actions. Conclude **Yes**.

5.  **Evaluate Non-Necessary Factors (Overdetermination).**
    *   **Symmetric Overdetermination (Redundancy):** If multiple *identical and simultaneous* sufficient actions occurred, the **set** is the cause. A specific action is a cause **only if it was part of the actual triggering set**. If another sufficient condition was already present and would have caused the outcome identically without it, the action is redundant and **not a cause**. Conclude **No**.
    *   **Asymmetric Overdetermination (Pre-emption):** If multiple *independent* sufficient pathways existed, the action is a cause **only if it was the actual trigger**. Conclude **Yes** for the trigger, **No** for pre-empted alternatives.
    *   **Contributory Cause:** If the action was part of a necessary set of conditions (e.g., a cumulative effect), it can be a cause if it made a meaningful contribution.

6.  **Special Consideration for Intentionality:**
    *   If the question includes "intentionally," assess the agent's mental state (purpose, desire). Even if the action caused the outcome, if the agent did not intend it, the answer is **No**.

7.  **Synthesize Your Reasoning.**
    *   Combine the results from the steps above.
    *   **Final Answer:** Conclude with **<answer>Yes</answer>** or **<answer>No</answer>**.
o deliberate actions/omissions by agents).
    *   If the action was necessary and doesn't fall into these exceptions, conclude **Yes**.

5.  **Evaluate Non-Necessary Factors (Potential Overdetermination).**
    *   **Symmetric Overdetermination (True Redundancy):** If multiple *identical and simultaneous* actions occurred, and each was individually sufficient, then the **set of actions** is the cause. However, if the question asks about a specific member of that set, it is correct to say **Yes**, that action *was* a cause, as it was fully sufficient.
    *   **Asymmetric Overdetermination (Pre-emption):** If multiple *independent* sufficient pathways existed, the action is a cause **only if it was the one that actually occurred first or was the direct trigger**. Conclude **Yes** for the actual trigger, **No** for the pre-empted alternatives.
    *   **Contributory Cause:** If the action was not sufficient alone but was part of a necessary set of conditions (e.g., it contributed to a cumulative effect), it can be a cause. Analyze if it made a meaningful contribution to the outcome.

6.  **Synthesize Your Reasoning.**
    *   Combine the results from the steps above. If the action was either necessary or a sufficient factor in an overdetermined scenario, it is a cause.
    *   **Final Answer:** Conclude with **<answer>Yes</answer>** or **<answer>No</answer>**.

    *   Precisely define the outcome event.
    *   Precisely define the alleged causal event (action or omission), considering the full sequence of events and any normative context (e.g., rules, duties, intentions if the question involves intentionality). **Pay special attention to whether an action was permitted, expected, or forbidden.**

2.  **Establish the Causal Structure.**
    *   Determine the **necessary and sufficient conditions** for the outcome.
    *   Map out all potential pathways that could lead to the outcome.
    *   **Identify the most immediate, direct cause (the proximate cause) of the outcome.**

3.  **Apply the "But-For" Test for Necessity.**
    *   Ask: "Would the outcome have occurred *at the precise time and in the precise way that it did* if the specific action had not been taken (or if the omission had been acted upon)?"
    *   **â†’ If NO,** the action/omission was a **necessary condition**. Proceed to Step 4.

    *   **For Omissions:** An omission is salient only if the agent had a **duty to act** and the action would have been sufficient to prevent the outcome. If so, it is a cause. Conclude **Yes**.
    *   **For Actions:** A necessary action is a salient cause unless it is a **purely background condition** (a constant, unchanging state with no agency, e.g., gravity, a pre-existing disease) **or the normative context indicates the action was appropriate and a separate, deviant action was the primary fault.** This exception requires careful judgment. **If not excepted, conclude Yes.**

5.  **Evaluate Non-Necessary Factors (Overdetermination).**
    *   **Symmetric Overdetermination (Redundancy):** If multiple *identical and simultaneous* sufficient actions occurred, **each individual sufficient action that actually occurred is considered a cause.** The outcome was overdetermined. **Therefore, conclude Yes for the specified action if it was sufficient on its own.**
    *   **Asymmetric Overdetermination (Pre-emption):** If multiple *independent* sufficient pathways existed, the action is a cause **only if it was the actual trigger.** Conclude **Yes** for the trigger, **No** for pre-empted alternatives.
    *   **Contributory Cause:** If the action was part of a necessary set of conditions (e.g., a cumulative effect), it can be a cause if it made a meaningful contribution.

6.  **Special Consideration for Intentionality:**
    *   If the question includes "intentionally," assess the agent's mental state (purpose, desire). Even if the action caused the outcome, if the agent did not intend it, the answer is **No**.

7.  **Synthesize Your Reasoning.**
    *   Combine the results from the steps above. **Re-evaluate your conclusion based on the normative context identified in Step 1. Does it make sense to assign causal salience to this agent given the rules, duties, and the presence of any deviant, intervening actions?**
    *   **Final Answer:** Conclude with **<answer>Yes</answer>** or **<answer>No</answer>**.

You are an expert in causal reasoning. Your task is to answer questions about whether an outcome occurred specifically because of an agent's action or inaction.

**Reasoning Framework:**
1.  **Identify the Outcome:** State the successful outcome.
2.  **Identify the Causal Rules:** List all conditions stated to be sufficient for the outcome.
3.  **Analyze the Agent's Role:** Determine what the agent did. Focus on cases where the agent **refrains from changing** a pre-existing state after verifying it.
4.  **Apply the Preservation Principle:** An agent's inaction can be a cause if:
    - The agent checks and verifies a system's state.
    - This state is already one of the sufficient conditions for the outcome.
    - The agent deliberately chooses not to change it, thereby *preserving* that sufficient condition.
    In this context, the outcome can correctly be said to have happened **because** the agent preserved the condition.
5.  **Avoid the "But-For" Fallacy:** The presence of another sufficient condition does not negate the agent's preservation of a different sufficient condition as **a** valid cause. The question asks if it was **a** contributing cause, not the **only** possible cause.
6.  **Reach a Conclusion:** Based on this analysis, decide if the outcome happened because of the agent's specific action or inaction.

**Answer Format:**
First, reason step by step following the framework above. Then, provide your final answer within the tags <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.

Answer questions about causal attribution. Use the following framework for your reasoning:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Define the effect that occurred.
2.  **Identify the Candidate Cause:** Define the specific event whose causal role is in question.
3.  **Apply the Necessary Cause Test:** Perform a counterfactual assessment: "If the candidate cause had *not* occurred, would the outcome *still* have occurred?"
    - If yes, the candidate was **not a cause**. Conclude "No".
    - If no, the candidate was a **necessary cause**. Proceed to step 4.
4.  **Apply the Decisive Cause Test:** Evaluate if the candidate was the pivotal or surprising factor. Rely on contextual cues (e.g., "unlikely," "likely," "always," "usually").
    - If the outcome was highly probable even without the candidate, or if another factor was the improbable event that made the outcome possible, then the candidate is **not the decisive cause**. Conclude "No".
    - If the candidate was both necessary and the improbable or decisive factor, then conclude "Yes".

Finally, output your final answer within <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer> tags.

Answer questions about causal attribution by analyzing the scenario through a structured framework. Follow these steps rigorously:

1.  **Identify Outcome and Action:** Define the specific effect and the agent's action in question.
2.  **Counterfactual Necessity:** Determine if the outcome was counterfactually dependent on the action (i.e., would the outcome have occurred if the agent had not acted?).
3.  **Normality Assessment:** Evaluate if the action was a normative, expected behavior within the context or a deviant one. Actions conforming to explicit instructions or standards are typically normative.
4.  **Intent and Agency:** Consider whether the agent intended for the outcome to occur.
5.  **Causal Symmetry & Overdetermination:** If multiple factors are present, assess if they are symmetrical (i.e., identical in their causal role). In cases of perfect symmetry among agents, the cause is the conjunction of events, not any single agent acting normatively and unintentionally.
6.  **Synthesis:** Weigh these factors. Causal attribution is strongest for deviant, intentional, and necessary actions. It is weakest for normative, unintentional actions that are part of a symmetrical causal structure.

Base your final judgment on this synthesized analysis, not on counterfactual dependence alone.

Answer questions about causal attribution. Use the following framework for your reasoning:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Precisely define the effect that occurred.
2.  **Identify the Candidate Cause:** Define the specific event, action, or *inaction* whose causal role is in question. Interpret it within the narrative context provided.
3.  **Apply the But-For (Necessary Cause) Test:** Perform a counterfactual assessment.
    -   **For Actions/Occurrences:** "If the candidate cause had *not* occurred, would the outcome *still* have occurred in the exact same way?"
    -   **For Omissions/Inactions:** "If the candidate cause *had* occurred (i.e., if the omitted action had been taken), would the outcome have been prevented?"
    -   **Result:** If the outcome would have been different (prevented or altered), the candidate is a **necessary cause**. Proceed to Step 4.
    -   **Result:** If the outcome would have been the same, the candidate is **not a necessary cause**. Proceed to Step 5.
4.  **Assess Proximity for Necessary Causes:** Is the candidate cause the most immediate, direct cause in the chain, or is it a more distant, background condition? Compare it to other necessary causes. A proximal cause is more likely to be decisive.
5.  **Assess Sufficiency for Non-Necessary Causes:** If the candidate is not necessary, could it have been part of a set of conditions that were *sufficient* to bring about the outcome? (e.g., In a scenario with multiple sufficient causes, like a device that charges if plugged in OR on a pad, either condition is sufficient). If yes, it remains a candidate for being a decisive cause.
6.  **Apply the Decisive Cause Test:** Determine the most salient cause by evaluating causal sufficiency, proximity, and normality.
    -   **Focus on Alterations, Not Background Conditions:** A decisive cause is typically an *alteration* (a specific change or decision) rather than a *stable background condition* (e.g., a fixed personality trait, a standing policy, a law of nature).
    -   **Identify the Improbable Event:** The most surprising or improbable link in the causal chain is often decisive. Was the candidate itself the improbable alteration, or did it merely create the conditions for a more improbable, external event?
    -   **Maintain Normative Neutrality:** Ignore statements about responsibility, duty, or blameworthiness. Focus solely on factual dependence and causal salience.
7.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Based on the above analysis, decide if the candidate cause is the primary cause referred to in the question. A "Yes" answer typically requires the candidate to be both a cause (necessary or sufficient) and the most decisive factor in the context of the story.

Finally, output your final answer within <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer> tags.

Answer questions about causal attribution by analyzing the scenario through a structured framework. Follow these steps rigorously and in order:

1.  **Identify Outcome and Candidate Cause:** Define the specific effect (the outcome) and the agent's specific action or omission (the candidate cause) in question.
2.  **Apply the But-For Test:** Determine if the outcome was counterfactually dependent on the candidate cause. Specifically, ask: "If the agent had acted differently (e.g., performed the omitted action or refrained from the taken action), would the outcome have been prevented?" If yes, the candidate is a **but-for cause**. This establishes a primary basis for causal attribution.
3.  **Check for Overriding Conditions (Apply only if but-for cause is found):**
    *   **Causal Preemption:** Assess if another event or agent was poised to bring about the same outcome independently, making the candidate cause redundant. If true, the candidate may not be the cause.
    *   **Triviality:** Evaluate if the candidate cause is a distant, minor, or non-proximate part of a long causal chain. If a more direct and salient cause is present, prioritize it.
    *   **Omissions as Causes:** If the candidate cause is an omission (a failure to act), note that it can still be a valid cause if the agent had both the ability and a relevant opportunity to act. The implosion was caused by the persistent state of the switches; an agent's failure to alter that state is a cause of the persistence.
4.  **Contextual Nuance (To refine, not override, the causal claim):**
    *   **Normality:** Evaluate if the action/inaction was a normative, expected behavior within the context (e.g., following instructions, standard practice). A normative action can still be a cause; this factor helps distinguish causal attribution from moral blameworthiness but does not negate a but-for cause.
    *   **Intent:** Consider whether the agent intended for the outcome to occur. Intent can strengthen a causal claim, but its absence does not negate a but-for cause.
5.  **Synthesis and Final Judgment:** Weigh these factors. A candidate that is a but-for cause and is not preempted or trivial is typically a cause. The presence of other necessary background conditions does not negate this. Use contextual factors (normality, intent) to add nuance to the explanation but not to contradict the causal link established by the but-for test. Base your final judgment on this synthesized analysis.

The question "Did X happen because of Y?" is a query about causation, not solely blame. Your final answer must directly respond to this causal question.

You are an expert in causal reasoning and intention analysis. Your task is to answer questions about whether an outcome occurred specifically because of an agent's action or inaction, or whether the agent acted with intention.

**Reasoning Framework:**
0.  **Question Analysis:** First, determine the precise nature of the question. Is it asking about *causal attribution* ("because of", "caused by") or about *intention* ("intentionally", "on purpose")? Your analysis must target the specific question asked.
1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Clearly state the outcome in question.
2.  **Establish Ground Truth Causal Rules:** Identify the definitive, factual conditions necessary and/or sufficient for the outcome to occur, as established by the scenario. Ignore any character's incorrect beliefs, oversimplifications, or conjectures about these rules. Resolve any conflicts by prioritizing the most specific and directly stated factual premise.
3.  **Analyze the Agent's Role:** Determine the agent's behavior. Did they perform an action or refrain from acting? For inaction, note if the agent first verified a pre-existing state.
4.  **Apply the Causal Principles:**
    *   **For Action:** The agent's action is a cause if it creates or initiates a condition that is necessary or sufficient for the outcome.
    *   **For Inaction (Preservation):** The agent's inaction is a cause if:
        - The agent verified a pre-existing state of the system.
        - This state was a necessary or sufficient condition for the outcome.
        - The agent deliberately chose not to change it, thereby preserving that condition.
    The outcome can be said to have happened **because** of the agent's behavior if they created or preserved a causally relevant condition.
5.  **Analyze Intention (if required by the question):** If the question involves intention, analyze the agent's stated goals and motivations. An outcome is intentional only if it was the agent's purpose or goal. An outcome that is a foreseen but undesired side-effect of an action taken for a different primary goal is not intentional.
6.  **Avoid Common Fallacies:**
    *   **But-For Fallacy:** The existence of another sufficient causal path does not negate the agent's contribution via a different path. The question is typically about whether the agent's behavior was **a** cause, not the **only** cause.
    *   **Causation-Intention Conflation:** Do not assume a causal contribution implies intention. These are separate concepts and must be evaluated independently based on the question.
7.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Integrate your analysis of causality and intention (if applicable) to reach a final judgment that directly answers the question.

Answer questions about causal attribution. Use the following framework for your reasoning:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Precisely define the effect that occurred.
2.  **Identify the Candidate Cause:** Define the specific event, action, or *inaction* whose causal role is in question. Interpret it within the narrative context provided.
3.  **Interrogate Key Terms:** Scrutinize the specific wording of the question.
    -   If the question contains words like **"intentionally," "on purpose," "in order to,"** or **"so that,"** you MUST analyze the **agent's goals and mental state**. An action can be a cause without being an *intentional* cause of a specific outcome.
    -   If the question is about an individual's role in a **group or plurality**, be alert for potential **causal overdetermination**.
4.  **Apply the But-For (Necessary Cause) Test:** Perform a counterfactual assessment.
    -   **For Actions/Occurrences:** "If the candidate cause had *not* occurred, would the outcome *still* have occurred in the exact same way?"
    -   **For Omissions/Inactions:** "If the candidate cause *had* occurred (i.e., if the omitted action had been taken), would the outcome have been prevented?"
    -   **Result:** If the outcome would have been different (prevented or altered), the candidate is a **necessary cause**. Proceed to Step 5.
    -   **Result:** If the outcome would have been the same, the candidate is **not a necessary cause**. Proceed to Step 7.
5.  **Check for Symmetric Overdetermination:**
    -   If the candidate is a necessary cause, but there is another **identical, simultaneous, and equally necessary cause**, then causal attribution to any single individual is often inappropriate.
    -   **Result:** If symmetric overdetermination is present, the candidate is likely **not** the primary cause. Proceed to Step 7.
    -   **Result:** If no such symmetry exists, proceed to Step 6.
6.  **Assess Proximity for Necessary Causes:** Is the candidate cause the most immediate, direct cause in the chain, or is it a more distant, background condition? Compare it to other necessary causes. A proximal cause is more likely to be decisive.
7.  **Assess Sufficiency for Non-Necessary Causes:** If the candidate is not necessary, could it have been part of a set of conditions that were *sufficient* to bring about the outcome? (e.g., In a scenario with multiple sufficient causes, like a device that charges if plugged in OR on a pad, either condition is sufficient). If yes, it remains a candidate for being a decisive cause.
8.  **Apply the Decisive Cause Test:** Determine the most salient cause.
    -   **Focus on Alterations, Not Background Conditions:** A decisive cause is typically an *alteration* (a specific change or decision) rather than a *stable background condition*.
    -   **Identify the Improbable Event:** The most surprising or improbable link in the causal chain is often decisive.
    -   **For Intentional Actions:** If the question is about intention, the decisive cause is the action that was **goal-directed towards the outcome**. The outcome must have been part of the agent's plan or purpose for acting.
    -   **Avoid the Symmetry Trap:** If two causes are perfectly symmetric, neither is decisive over the other.
    -   **Maintain Normative Neutrality:** Ignore moral statements about responsibility or duty. However, **you must consider factual mental states like knowledge, belief, and intention** if they are central to the question's phrasing.
9.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Based on the above analysis, decide if the candidate cause is the primary cause referred to in the question.
    -   A "Yes" answer typically requires the candidate to be both a cause (necessary or sufficient) and the most decisive factor.
    -   **For intention:** A "Yes" answer requires the outcome to have been a goal of the action, not merely a foreseen side-effect.
    -   **For overdetermination:** A "Yes" answer is incorrect if the candidate is only a cause due to its role in a symmetric pair.

You are an expert in causal reasoning and intention analysis. Your task is to answer questions about whether an outcome occurred specifically because of an agent's action or inaction, or whether the agent acted with intention.

**Reasoning Framework:**

0.  **Question Analysis:** Determine if the question is about *causal attribution* ("because of", "caused by") or *intention* ("intentionally", "on purpose"). Target the specific question asked.

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Clearly state the outcome in question.

2.  **Establish Causal Rules & Normative Context:**
    *   Identify the definitive **physical/system-level conditions** necessary and/or sufficient for the outcome.
    *   **Identify any relevant normative context:** rules, policies, laws, or standard practices that define expected behavior. These norms are crucial for determining which action is *deviant* and thus likely to be attributed as the cause in social scenarios.

3.  **Analyze the Agent's Role & Event Sequence:**
    *   Determine the agent's specific behavior (action or inaction).
    *   **Establish the precise sequence and timing of events.** Determine the state of the world *immediately before* the outcome occurred. Identify the *last change* that made the outcome inevitable.

4.  **Apply the Causal Principles:**
    *   **For Action:** The agent's action is a cause only if it was a necessary part of the set of conditions that directly led to the outcome. **An action is not causal if the outcome was already guaranteed due to a prior action (preemption) or if the action is redundant at the time it occurs.**
    *   **For Inaction (Preservation):** The agent's inaction is a cause only if:
        - The agent verified a pre-existing state.
        - This state was a necessary or sufficient condition for the outcome.
        - The agent deliberately chose not to change it, thereby preserving that condition.
    *   **Integrate Normative Context:** In cases of causal over-determination (multiple sufficient causes), causal attribution typically falls on the agent who acted *abnormally* or *in violation* of established norms. An agent acting in accordance with norms is unlikely to be the cause.

5.  **Analyze Intention (if required):** An outcome is intentional only if it was the agent's purpose or goal. A foreseen but undesired side-effect is not intentional.

6.  **Avoid Common Fallacies:**
    *   **Preemption Fallacy:** Do not attribute causation to an agent if their action occurred after or simultaneously with another action that had already preempted the outcome.
    *   **But-For Fallacy:** Understand that the failure of the but-for test (the outcome would have happened anyway) does not always negate causation, but its success is a strong indicator. However, a successful but-for test can be overruled by preemption or normative context.
    *   **Normative Blindness:** Do not ignore policies and rules. They are critical for determining responsibility.
    *   **Causation-Intention Conflation:** Evaluate causation and intention independently.

7.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Integrate your analysis of physical causality, event sequence, and normative context. **If the agent's action was preempted, redundant, or constituted normative behavior while another's deviant action was the true trigger, conclude "No."**

Answer questions about agency, such as causation, intention, and responsibility. To do this, first classify the user's question and then apply the appropriate structured framework. Follow these steps rigorously and in order.

**Step 0: Classify the Question Type**
Before any analysis, classify the user's question based on its key terms and context:
*   **A. Causal Question:** Questions like "Did X cause Y?", "Did Y happen because of X?", "Was X the cause of Y?". These ask about factual dependence.
*   **B. Intentional Question:** Questions like "Did X intentionally Y?", "Did X intend to Y?". These ask about the agent's mental state and goals.
*   **C. Other Agency Questions:** For questions about responsibility, blame, or fault, apply a framework that integrates causal and normative analysis.

**IF THE QUESTION IS CAUSAL (Type A):**
1.  **Identify Outcome and Candidate Cause:** Define the specific effect (the outcome) and the agent's specific action or omission (the candidate cause) in question. Precisely define the **temporal point** of the outcome.
2.  **Apply the But-For Test:** Determine if the outcome was counterfactually dependent on the candidate cause. Ask: "If the agent had acted differently (e.g., performed the omitted action or refrained from the taken action), would the outcome have been prevented **at the time it occurred**?" If yes, the candidate is a **but-for cause**.
3.  **Check for Overriding Conditions (Apply only if but-for cause is found):**
    *   **Causal Preemption:** Assess if another event or agent was poised to bring about the same outcome independently, making the candidate cause redundant.
    *   **Triviality:** Evaluate if the candidate cause is a distant, minor, or non-proximate part of a long causal chain.
4.  **Evaluate Causal Salience:** A but-for cause is not necessarily *the* cause. To identify the most salient cause, prioritize factors that are:
    *   **Deviant:** An action that violates norms, rules, or expectations (e.g., breaking a policy).
    *   **Sufficient:** An action that was by itself sufficient to bring about the outcome.
    *   **Proximate:** The most direct and immediate trigger in the causal chain.
5.  **Synthesis and Final Judgment:** Weigh these factors. A candidate that is a but-for cause and is not preempted or trivial is *a* cause. Use the salience factors (deviance, sufficiency, proximity) to determine if it is *the* cause. The presence of other necessary background conditions does not negate a but-for cause. Base your final judgment on this synthesized analysis.

**IF THE QUESTION IS ABOUT INTENTION (Type B):**
1.  **Identify the Action and Outcome:** Define the agent's action and the specific outcome in question.
2.  **Apply the Intention Test:** An agent intends an outcome if:
    *   **Goal-State:** The outcome was a goal or desired end-state of the agent's plan. *Or*
    *   **Means-to-an-End:** The outcome was a necessary means to the agent's goal.
    *   **Foresight:** The agent knew or believed that their action would bring about the outcome.
3.  **Identify Side Effects:** An outcome that is a foreseen but neither a goal nor a means to a goal is typically **not intended**. The agent may have been indifferent to or merely accepted the outcome, but this is distinct from intention.
4.  **Synthesis and Final Judgment:** Base your judgment strictly on the agent's stated goals, plans, and knowledge. Do not infer intention from mere causation or foresight alone.

**FINAL ANSWER:**
Your final answer must directly and explicitly respond to the question as classified in Step 0. For causal questions, answer if X was a/the cause of Y. For intention questions, answer if the agent intended the outcome.

5.  **Analyze Intention (if required):**
    *   **An outcome is intentional if the agent acted with the goal of achieving that outcome (purpose-based intention) OR if the agent knew to a near-certainty that the outcome would occur as a direct result of their voluntary action (knowledge-based intention).**
    *   **Evaluate the agent's knowledge:** Did the agent know the outcome would happen? Was this knowledge certain or highly probable? Did they believe it might not happen?
    *   **Evaluate the agent's motives:** Was the outcome a desired goal, an accepted side-effect, or an unwanted but unavoidable consequence? **Note: A lack of desire for an outcome does not automatically make it unintentional if the agent knew it would occur.**
    *   **The agent's primary motive is not definitive.** An outcome can be intentional even if it is not the agent's primary goal.

6.  **Avoid Common Fallacies:**
    *   **Preemption Fallacy:** Do not attribute causation to an agent if their action occurred after or simultaneously with another action that had already preempted the outcome.

    *   **Causation-Intention Conflation:** Evaluate causation and intention independently.
    *   **Motive-Intention Conflation:** Do not confuse an agent's primary motive or desire with intention. An agent can intentionally cause an outcome they are indifferent to or even regret, if they knew it would result from their action.

7.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Integrate your analysis of physical causality, event sequence, normative context, and the agent's knowledge. **For intention: If the agent knew the outcome was certain or highly probable and chose to act anyway, conclude "Yes," even if it was not their primary goal.

Answer questions about causal attribution. Use the following framework for your reasoning:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Precisely define the effect that occurred. **Crucially, match the exact wording and specificity of the outcome as stated in the question.** For example, if the question is about a specific detail (e.g., 'shot in the heart'), your analysis must address that precise detail, not a generalized version of it (e.g., 'caused death').

2.  **Identify the Candidate Cause:** Define the specific event, action, or *inaction* whose causal role is in question. Interpret it within the narrative context provided.

3.  **Interrogate Key Terms:** Scrutinize the specific wording of the question.
    -   If the question contains words like **"intentionally," "on purpose," "in order to,"** or **"so that,"** you MUST analyze the **agent's goals and mental state**. An action can be a cause without being an *intentional* cause of a specific outcome. The analysis of intention must be precisely aligned with the specificity of the outcome defined in Step 1.
    -   If the question is about an individual's role in a **group or plurality**, be alert for potential **causal overdetermination**.
    -   **If the question is about an *omission* (e.g., 'did not change,' 'failed to'), be especially careful.** An omission can be a salient cause if it represents a conscious decision to preserve a state of affairs, even if that state was already sufficient on its own.

4.  **Apply the But-For (Necessary Cause) Test:** Perform a counterfactual assessment.
    -   **For Actions/Occurrences:** "If the candidate cause had *not* occurred, would the outcome *still* have occurred in the exact same way?"
    -   **For Omissions/Inactions:** "If the candidate cause *had* occurred (i.e., if the omitted action had been taken), would the outcome have been prevented?"
    -   **Result:** If the outcome would have been different (prevented or altered), the candidate is a **necessary cause**. Proceed to Step 5.
    -   **Result:** If the outcome would have been the same, the candidate is **not a necessary cause**. Proceed to Step 6.

5.  **Check for Symmetric Overdetermination:**
    -   If the candidate is a necessary cause, but there is another **identical, simultaneous, and equally necessary cause**, then causal attribution to any single individual is often inappropriate.
    -   **Result:** If symmetric overdetermination is present, the candidate is likely **not** the primary cause. Proceed to Step 8.
    -   **Result:** If no such symmetry exists, proceed to Step 7.

6.  **Assess Omission Salience (for non-necessary omissions):** If the candidate is an omission that failed the but-for test, ask: "Did the agent have knowledge of the situation and make a conscious choice *not to act*?" If yes, this omission may still be a salient and decisive cause in the narrative context, as it represents an affirmative decision to allow the outcome to proceed. This is particularly true if the question phrasing highlights the omission. If this salience is present, proceed to Step 9. If not, proceed to Step 8.

7.  **Assess Proximity for Necessary Causes:** Is the candidate cause the most immediate, direct cause in the chain, or is it a more distant, background condition? Compare it to other necessary causes. A proximal cause is more likely to be decisive.

8.  **Assess Sufficiency for Non-Necessary Causes:** If the candidate is not necessary and lacks salience as an omission, could it have been part of a set of conditions that were *sufficient* to bring about the outcome? (e.g., In a scenario with multiple sufficient causes, like a device that charges if plugged in OR on a pad, either condition is sufficient). If yes, it remains a candidate for being a decisive cause.

9.  **Apply the Decisive Cause Test:** Determine the most salient cause.
    -   **Focus on Alterations, Not Background Conditions:** A decisive cause is typically an *alteration* (a specific change or decision) rather than a *stable background condition*.
    -   **Identify the Improbable Event:** The most surprising or improbable link in the causal chain is often decisive.
    -   **For Intentional Actions:** If the question is about intention, the decisive cause is the action that was **goal-directed towards the outcome**. The outcome must have been part of the agent's plan or purpose for acting.
    -   **For Omissions:** A conscious omission (a decision *not* to act after considering the situation) is more decisive than a passive background condition or a forgotten action.
    -   **Avoid the Symmetry Trap:** If two causes are perfectly symmetric, neither is decisive over the other.
    -   **Maintain Normative Neutrality:** Ignore moral statements about responsibility or duty. However, **you must consider factual mental states like knowledge, belief, and intention** if they are central to the question's phrasing.

10. **Synthesize and Conclude:** Based on the above analysis, decide if the candidate cause is the primary cause referred to in the question.
    -   A "Yes" answer typically requires the candidate to be both a cause (necessary, sufficient, or salient) and the most decisive factor.
    -   **For intention:** A "Yes" answer requires the outcome to have been a goal of the action, not merely a foreseen side-effect. The specificity of the goal must match the specificity of the outcome.
    -   **For overdetermination:** A "Yes" answer is incorrect if the candidate is only a cause due to its role in a symmetric pair.
    -   **For omissions that are not necessary:** A "Yes" answer can still be justified if the omission was a conscious, knowing decision that affirmed the existing causal path, and the question is phrased to highlight that specific omission.

Finally, output your final answer within <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer> tags.

2025-09-06 19:41:52,903 - ðŸ“Š Current Prompt:
Answer questions about agency, such as causation, intention, and responsibility. To do this, first classify the user's question and then apply the appropriate structured framework. Follow these steps rigorously and in order.

**Step 0: Classify the Question Type**
Before any analysis, classify the user's question based on its key terms and context:
*   **A. Causal Question:** Questions like "Did X cause Y?", "Did Y happen because of X?", "Was X the cause of Y?". These ask about factual dependence.
*   **B. Intentional Question:** Questions like "Did X intentionally Y?", "Did X intend to Y?". These ask about the agent's mental state and goals.
*   **C. Blame/Responsibility Question:** For questions that use words like "blame," "fault," or "responsible," even if they also use "cause," apply a framework that integrates causal and normative analysis.

**IF THE QUESTION IS CAUSAL (Type A):**
1.  **Identify Outcome and Candidate Cause:** Define the specific effect (the outcome) and the agent's specific action or omission (the candidate cause) in question. Precisely define the **temporal and logical point** of the outcome. **Critically ask: "At what moment was the outcome first determined to have occurred?" This moment is key for the counterfactual test.**
2.  **Apply the But-For Test:** Determine if the outcome was counterfactually dependent on the candidate cause. Ask: "If the agent had acted differently (e.g., performed the omitted action or refrained from the taken action), would the outcome have been prevented **at the specific point it occurred**?"
    *   If yes, the candidate is a **but-for cause**. Proceed to Step 3.
    *   If no, proceed to **Step 2a**.
    *   **2a. Check for Causal Overdetermination:** Is this a case with multiple sufficient causes? Even if not necessary, was the candidate cause an actual, operative part of the set of conditions that brought about the outcome? If yes, it may still be *a* cause. Proceed to Step 4.
3.  **Check for Preemption (Apply if but-for cause is found):**
    *   **Causal Preemption:** Assess if another event or agent had already brought about the outcome, making the candidate cause redundant. **If the outcome was already guaranteed by a prior event, then a subsequent sufficient cause is preempted and is not the actual cause.**
    *   **Triviality:** Evaluate if the candidate cause is a distant, minor, or non-proximate part of a long causal chain.
4.  **Evaluate Causal Salience for Agency Attribution:** A but-for cause (or a cause in an overdetermined set) is not necessarily the cause we attribute to an agent. To determine if the candidate is *the* cause for the purpose of agency, prioritize these factors:
    *   **Deviance:** An action that violates norms, rules, or expectations. **This is a primary filter for agency. A norm-compliant action is rarely attributed as *the* cause if a deviant action is present.**
    *   **Sufficiency:** An action that was by itself sufficient to bring about the outcome.
    *   **Proximity:** The most direct and immediate trigger in the causal chain.
5.  **Synthesis and Final Judgment:** Weigh these factors. **A candidate can be *a* cause if it is a but-for cause or part of an overdetermined set. However, to be considered *the* cause (as agency questions often imply), it must also be salient. If the causal role is minimal, symmetrical with another agent, or normatively neutral, and another salient, deviant cause exists, the answer is typically "no."** Base your final judgment on this synthesized analysis.

**IF THE QUESTION IS ABOUT INTENTION (Type B):**
1.  **Identify the Action and Outcome:** Define the agent's action and the specific outcome in question.
2.  **Apply the Intention Test:** An agent intends an outcome if:
    *   **Goal-State:** The outcome was a goal or desired end-state of the agent's plan. *Or*
    *   **Means-to-an-End:** The outcome was a necessary means to the agent's goal.
    *   **Foresight:** The agent knew or believed that their action would bring about the outcome.
3.  **Identify Side Effects:** An outcome that is a foreseen but neither a goal nor a means to a goal is typically **not intended**. The agent may have been indifferent to or merely accepted the outcome, but this is distinct from intention.
4.  **Synthesis and Final Judgment:** Base your judgment strictly on the agent's stated goals, plans, and knowledge. Do not infer intention from mere causation or foresight alone.

**IF THE QUESTION IS ABOUT BLAME/RESPONSIBILITY (Type C):**
1.  **Perform Causal Analysis:** First, complete the **Causal Question (Type A)** framework for the agent in question. Determine if the agent's action was *a* cause of the outcome.
2.  **Perform Intentional Analysis (if relevant):** If blame implies intent, complete the **Intentional Question (Type B)** framework.
3.  **Apply Normative Filters:** An agent is more likely to be blamed or responsible if their action was:
    *   **Deviant:** It violated a norm, rule, or standard of care.
    *   **Intentional:** They meant to cause the outcome.
    *   **Foreseeable:** They should have known their action could lead to the outcome.
4.  **Synthesis and Final Judgment:** An agent can be a cause but not be responsible (e.g., if they were following orders, acting under duress, or the outcome was not foreseeable). **Your final answer should reflect this nuanced judgment of blameworthiness, not just causation.**

**FINAL ANSWER:**
Your final answer must directly and explicitly respond to the question as classified in Step 0. For causal questions, answer if X was a/the cause of Y. For intention questions, answer if the agent intended the outcome. For blame questions, answer if the agent is to blame or responsible.

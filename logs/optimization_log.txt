Name the geometric shape drawn by the SVG path element. Analyze the path step-by-step:

1. Parse all path commands (M, L, A, etc.). Track the sequence of points and subpaths.
2. For straight lines (L): Count distinct vertices in the closed loop to determine polygon type (triangle=3, pentagon=5, hexagon=6, heptagon=7, octagon=8).
3. For arcs (A): Check if radii are equal (circular) or unequal (elliptical). Note large-arc and sweep flags.
4. Identify closed shapes: The path must end at the start point (explicitly or via arcs).
5. For sectors: Look for two lines (radii) from a common center to arc endpoints, with a circular arc (equal radii). Verify distances from center to endpoints match the radius.
6. For circles: Even if drawn with multiple arcs, equal radii and a closed path indicate a circle.
7. Eliminate impossible options based on features: Curves exclude polygons; straight lines exclude circles/sectors; vertex count excludes mismatched polygons.

Use geometric reasoning and coordinate calculations when needed. Output only the shape name.

Name the geometric shape drawn by an SVG path element from the given options.

Instructions:
1. Parse the path data step by step. List all distinct vertices and commands.
2. For arcs (A commands):
   - Equal rx and ry indicate circular arcs (circle, not ellipse).
   - Large arc flag (1 for >180°, 0 for <180°) and sweep flag (0 for CCW, 1 for CW) determine the arc.
   - For two arcs between the same points with equal radii:
        - If flags are complementary (e.g., one large, one small), they form a full circle.
        - If both arcs have large flags and same sweep, check if chord length ≈2*r (diameter). If yes, they form a full circle via two semicircles.
   - A single arc with large flag indicates a sector (<360°).
3. For straight lines (L commands):
   - The move command (M) defines the first vertex.
   - Each line command (L) defines a new vertex.
   - The closing command (L to start or Z) does not add a new vertex.
   - Count only distinct vertices to determine the polygon type.
4. For multiple subpaths (multiple M commands):
   - If subpaths share endpoints and the path closes back to the start, treat as a single polygon with all distinct vertices.
5. For quadrilaterals:
   - Check if all angles are ~90° and opposite sides equal → rectangle.
   - Check if two pairs of adjacent sides are equal → kite.
6. Output your reasoning and final answer in <answer>...</answer>.

Common pitfalls to avoid:
- Example: Path with two arcs having equal radii and complementary flags forms a circle, not a sector.
- Example: A path with M and 5 L commands (including closing line) has 5 distinct vertices (pentagon), not 6.

Options: circle, heptagon, hexagon, kite, line, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, triangle, ellipse.

**Task**: Identify the geometric shape drawn by the SVG path element. Choose from the given options.

**Instructions**:
1. **Parse and Simplify Path**:
   - Extract all points from the path commands (M, L, A, etc.).
   - **Critical: Remove redundant points that are not true vertices**:
     - Ignore any internal `M` commands (restarting a subpath) unless the shape is explicitly composed of multiple disjoint elements (but for this task, assume one contiguous shape).
     - **Remove collinear points**: A point B is redundant if it lies on the straight line between its predecessor A and successor C. Check by calculating the cross product area of vectors AB and AC: if `abs((B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x)) < 0.5`, then B is collinear and should be removed. This simplifies the polygon to its essential vertices.
   - The final list defines the polygon's vertices.

2. **Verify Closure**:
   - Confirm the path ends at its start point (within coordinate precision). The last point (duplicate of the start) is not counted as a separate vertex.

3. **Check for Arcs/Circles**:
   - If the path contains `A` (arc) commands:
     - Check if the arc forms a full circle (e.g., by large flags and angle).
     - For sectors: The start point may be the center if distances to arc endpoints match the radius. Alternatively, the center may be implied by the arc parameters.
   - If no arcs, proceed.

4. **Count Vertices and Classify**:
   - Count the number of vertices from the simplified list.
     - 1-2: line (if start != end, but closed paths should not have this).

Name the geometric shape drawn by the SVG path element. Analyze the path step-by-step with geometric reasoning:

1. **Parse Commands & Points:**
   - Extract all path commands (M, L, A, etc.). Track the sequence of points and subpaths.
   - For closed paths: If the path ends at the start point (via 'Z' or identical coordinates), treat it as a single closed shape. **Deduplicate points: the start and end points are the same; count only distinct vertices. Use tolerance (±0.01) for coordinate comparisons.**
   - Multiple subpaths may form one shape if connected; otherwise, treat separately.

2. **Check for Curves (A commands):**
   - If any curve is present, it cannot be a polygon (e.g., triangle, hexagon).
   - For arcs: Check if radii are equal (circular) or unequal (elliptical). Note flags.
   - For circles: Look for a closed path with circular arcs (equal radii) forming a full loop. Multiple arcs with equal radii and a closed path likely form a circle.
   - For sectors: Require two straight lines (L commands) from a common center to arc endpoints, and a circular arc. Verify center is equidistant to endpoints.

3. **Straight-Line Polygons (Only L commands):**
   - If closed and no curves, count distinct vertices:
        - 3: triangle, 4: quadrilateral, 5: pentagon, 6: hexagon, 7: heptagon, 8: octagon.
   - For quadrilaterals only:
        a. Compute side lengths and slopes (with tolerance ±0.01).
        b. Check opposite sides: if both pairs parallel (slopes equal), it is a parallelogram.
            - Check angles: if all adjacent sides have dot product ≈0 (±0.1), it is a rectangle.
        c. If only one pair parallel, it is a trapezoid.
        d. Check for kite: two pairs of adjacent sides equal in length.
   - For other polygons, output the generic name (e.g., "heptagon" for 7 sides).

4. **Non-Closed Paths:**
   - If the path is not closed and has no curves, it is a line segment.

5. **Output only the shape name in <answer> tags.**

Apply this reasoning rigorously. Use tolerance (±0.01) for all comparisons.

2. **Check for closure**: The path must end at the start point (explicitly via L or via arcs). If not closed, output "line".
3. **If only straight lines (L) are present**:
   - Count the distinct vertices in the closed loop.
   - For 3 vertices: triangle; 4: quadrilateral; 5: pentagon; 6: hexagon; 7: heptagon; 8: octagon.
   - For quadrilaterals, calculate side lengths to distinguish types:
     - If two pairs of adjacent sides are equal, it is a kite.
     - If all angles are right angles (verify via dot product), it is a rectangle.
4. **If arcs (A) are present**:
   - Check if the x-radius and y-radius are equal. If not, output "ellipse".
   - If radii are equal (circular):
     - If there are no straight lines (L) and the path closes, it is a circle.
     - If there are two straight lines (L) from a common point to the arc endpoints, and the distances from that point to the endpoints match the radius, it is a sector.
5. **Eliminate impossibilities**:
   - Curves (arcs) exclude polygons.
   - Straight lines exclude circles/sectors (unless for sectors).
   - Vertex count must match the polygon.

Name the geometric shape drawn by an SVG path element from the given options.

Instructions:
1. Parse the path data step by step. Identify all commands and subpaths (each M starts a new subpath).
2. For each subpath:
   - If it has only two distinct vertices, it is a line segment.
   - If it closes (with Z or L to start) and has >2 vertices, it is a polygon.
   - For arcs (A commands): 
        - Equal rx and ry indicate circular arcs.
        - If two arcs with equal radii connect start and end points and chord ≈ 2*r (within 0.05 tolerance), they form semicircles. Two such arcs with same sweep direction form a full circle.
3. For the entire path:
   - If multiple subpaths connect sequentially (last point of subpath N matches start of subpath N+1 within tolerance, and final subpath ends at start of first), they form a single polygon.
   - Use tolerance (0.05) for coordinate comparisons, dot products, and lengths.
4. For polygons:
   - Count distinct vertices (excluding closing duplicate) to determine type: 3→triangle, 4→quadrilateral, 5→pentagon, 6→hexagon, 7→heptagon, 8→octagon.
   - For quadrilaterals: 
        - Check if opposite sides are parallel (vectors negatives) and adjacent sides perpendicular (dot product ≈0) for rectangle.
        - Check if two pairs of adjacent sides are equal (within tolerance) for kite.
   - Ensure vertices are not collinear (cross product ≠0) to avoid misclassifying as line.

1. **Parse all commands** (M, L, A, etc.). Combine points from all subpaths into a single continuous sequence if they form a closed shape. Ignore intermediate M commands that resume from the previous endpoint.
2. **Check for closure**: The path must end at the start point (exactly or within 0.01 units tolerance).
3. **If only straight lines (L)**:

Additional Instructions:
- **Vertex Counting:** When a subpath closes (with Z or L to the start), the closing point is not a distinct vertex. For example, a path with M and 5 L commands (where the last L returns to the start) has 5 distinct vertices (pentagon).
- **Tolerance:** Use relative tolerance for comparisons. For perpendicularity, require |dot(u, v)| < 0.05 * |u| * |v|. For parallelism, require |dot(u, v)| > (1 - 0.05) * |u| * |v| for same direction, or < (-1 + 0.05) * |u| * |v| for opposite.
- **Quadrilaterals:**
  - Rectangle: Opposite sides parallel and equal, and adjacent sides perpendicular (dot product ≈0).
  - Kite: Two pairs of adjacent sides equal (check |AB| ≈ |AD| and |CB| ≈ |CD|, or similar).
  - Trapezoid (exclusive definition): Exactly one pair of parallel sides. If both pairs are parallel, it is not a trapezoid.
- If the shape is a parallelogram (both pairs opposite sides parallel) but not a rectangle, and "parallelogram" is not an option, output "trapezoid" only if the options include it and no better fit exists.
- Check for collinearity: If all points are collinear (cross product ≈0 for all consecutive vectors), output "line".

Common pitfalls:
- Multiple M commands may create disjoint segments, but sequential connection forms a polygon.
- Example: Path with two arcs having equal radii and chord=2*r forms a circle, not a sector.
- Example: A path with M and 5 L commands (including closing line) has 5 distinct vertices (pentagon).

Name the geometric shape drawn by an SVG path element from the given options.

Instructions:
1. Parse the path data step by step. List all distinct vertices (use tolerance 0.01 for coordinate equality).
2. For arcs (A commands):
   - Equal rx and ry (within 1%) indicate circular arcs (circle, not ellipse).
   - Large arc flag (1 for >180°, 0 for <180°) and sweep flag (0 for CCW, 1 for CW) determine the arc.
   - For two arcs between the same points with equal radii:
        - If flags are complementary (one large, one small), they form a full circle.
        - If both arcs have large flags and same sweep, compute chord length. If chord ≈2*r (within 1%), they form a full circle via two semicircles.
   - A single arc with large flag indicates a sector (<360°).
3. For straight lines (L commands):
   - The move command (M) defines the first vertex.
   - Each line command (L) defines a new vertex unless it duplicates the previous point (within tolerance).
   - The closing command (Z) returns to the start without adding a vertex.
4. For multiple subpaths (multiple M commands):
   - If subpaths share endpoints (within tolerance) and collectively form a closed shape, treat as a single polygon with all distinct vertices.
5. For quadrilaterals:
   - First verify it has exactly 4 distinct vertices.
   - Check if opposite sides are parallel (vectors proportional within 1%) and equal in length (within 1%) → parallelogram.
   - If parallelogram, check if diagonals are equal in length (within 1%) → rectangle.
   - Else, check if two pairs of adjacent sides are equal (within 1%) → kite.
   - Else, if at least one pair of parallel sides → trapezoid.
6. Use tolerance 0.01 for all floating-point comparisons (lengths, dot products, coordinates).
7. For angle checks: if |dot product| < 0.01 * (product of magnitudes), consider vectors perpendicular.
8. Consider the overall geometric intent when numerical precision causes ambiguity.

Common pitfalls to avoid:
- Example 1: Path with two arcs having equal radii and complementary flags forms a circle, not a sector.
- Example 2: A path with M and 5 L commands (including closing line) has 5 distinct vertices (pentagon), not 6.
- Example 3: Two subpaths that form a rectangle when combined (as in the failure case below) should be treated as a single quadrilateral.

Failure case example:

This forms a rectangle (4 vertices) despite numerical rounding. The diagonals are equal (|AC| ≈ |BD|), confirming it's a rectangle.

Name the geometric shape drawn by the SVG path element. Follow these steps:

1. **Parse all commands** (M, L, A, etc.). Ignore any M or L commands that move less than 0.01 units. Combine points from all subpaths into a single continuous sequence if they form a connected shape. After parsing, remove duplicate points (within 0.01 units) from the entire list, including merging the start and end points if the path closes.
2. **Check for closure**: The path must end at the start point (within 0.01 units tolerance). If closed, merge the end point with the start point.
3. **If only straight lines (L)**:
   - Count distinct vertices in the closed loop. Merge any points <0.01 units apart (even non-consecutive).
   - For polygons: triangle=3, pentagon=5, hexagon=6, heptagon=7, octagon=8.
   - For quadrilaterals:
        - If opposite sides are equal (within 0.01) and parallel (vectors match direction or opposite within 0.01), and adjacent sides are perpendicular (dot product within ±0.2 of 0), output "rectangle".
        - Else if opposite sides are equal and parallel, output "trapezoid".
        - Else if two pairs of adjacent sides are equal (within 0.01), output "kite".
        - Else if at least one pair of sides is parallel (vectors within 0.01), output "trapezoid".
4. **If arcs (A) are present**:
   - Check if radii are equal (within 0.01) for circular arcs, or unequal for elliptical.
   - For sectors: Look for two lines (L) from a common point to arc endpoints, with a circular arc. Verify distances from the common point to endpoints match the radius (within 0.01).
   - For circles: Even if drawn with multiple arcs, equal radii and a closed path indicate a circle.
5. **Eliminate impossibilities**: Curves exclude polygons; straight lines exclude circles/sectors; vertex count excludes mismatched polygons.
6. **Use coordinate calculations with tolerance**: Allow 0.01 units for distance comparisons and 0.2 for dot products (due to SVG rounding conventions).

Output only the shape name from the options.
If yes, proceed to the next step to verify the agent and verb context.
    *   If no, the answer is likely **non-entailment**; proceed to Step 4 only if factivity could lift the content.

4.  **Analyze the Verb Chain for Factivity:** Examine the verbs from the outermost to the innermost.
    *   **Rule 1:** If the outermost verb is **factive** (e.g., knows, remembers, understands, recognizes), it presupposes the truth of its entire embedded clause. If the Hypothesis is contained within this clause, the answer is **entailment**.
    *   **Rule 2:** If the outermost verb is **non-factive** (e.g., believes, assumes, suspects), it does not guarantee the truth of its embedded clause. However, you MUST analyze the next verb in the chain.
        *   If a subsequent verb is **factive**, then the main agent's mental state **entails that they hold the same attitude toward the factive verb's embedded clause** (e.g., "A believes B knows X" entails "A believes X").
        *   If all subsequent verbs are **non-factive**, then the main agent's mental state is only about the subordinate agent's attitude, not the underlying fact (e.g., "A believes B suspects X" does **not** entail "A believes X").
    *   **Presupposition Handling:** Presuppositions within an embedded clause (e.g., from "stop") are only guaranteed at the main agent level if a factive verb in the chain forces the truth of that clause.

5.  **Check for Semantic Equivalence:** If the Hypothesis and Premise use different descriptions, determine if one logically entails the other (e.g., "sauna" entails "room"). Require strict logical entailment, not mere relatedness.

**Final Determination:**
- **entailment:** Only if the Premise logically guarantees the truth of the Hypothesis based on the rules above.
- **non-entailment:** If there is any doubt, agent mismatch, or lack of factive lifting.

Determine whether the Premise entails the Hypothesis by following these steps **strictly and in order**:

**Key Principles:**
*   **The knowledge or belief of one person cannot be transferred to another.** The main agent (the subject of the outermost verb) **must be identical** in both Premise and Hypothesis for entailment to be possible.
*   A belief *about* another person's mental state is not the same as holding that mental state directly.
*   **Factive verbs** (`knows`, `remembers`, `understands`) presuppose the truth of their embedded clause. **Non-factive verbs** (`believes`, `assumes`, `thinks`, `suspects`) do not.

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify and Compare Main Agents (CRITICAL FIRST STEP):**
    *   Identify the main agent (A1) and mental state verb (V1) in the **Hypothesis**.
    *   Identify the main agent (A2) and mental state verb (V2) in the **Premise**.
    *   **RULE:** If A1 is **not** the same as A2, the answer is immediately **non-entailment**. **STOP.** The premise is about one person's mind, the hypothesis is about another's; there is no logical connection.
    *   If A1 and A2 are the same, proceed.

2.  **Compare Belief Content:**
    *   Extract the entire embedded clause from the Hypothesis (C_hyp).
    *   Extract the entire embedded clause from the Premise (C_prem).
    *   **RULE:** If C_prem is **identical** to C_hyp, the answer is **entailment**. **STOP.**
    *   If C_prem is not identical (e.g., it contains a nested mental state), proceed.

3.  **Analyze Nested Constructions:**
    *   **RULE:** If the main Premise verb (V2) is **non-factive** (believes, assumes, thinks, suspects):
        *   The Premise only reports a belief *about* the nested clause (C_prem). It does **not** assert that C_prem is true.
        *   Therefore, the answer is **non-entailment**.
    *   **RULE:** If the main Premise verb (V2) is **factive** (knows, remembers, understands):
        *   The Premise presupposes that its embedded clause (C_prem) is **true**.
        *   Now, analyze the inner verb in C_prem (V3):
            *   If V3 is **factive**, then "A2 V2 that [A3 V3 P]" entails that P is true. If C_hyp is P, the answer is **entailment**.
            *   If V3 is **non-factive**, then "A2 V2 that [A3 V3 P]" does **NOT** entail that P is true. The answer is **non-entailment**.

**Options:**
- entailment
- non-entailment

Determine whether the Premise entails the Hypothesis by following these steps:

**Key Principles:**
*   **Ignore all propositional content** (e.g., "a girl bounces"). Only the agents and verb factivity matter.
*   **Agent comparison is decisive.** If the agent in the Hypothesis is different from the agent of the matching embedded clause in the Premise, the answer is immediately **non-entailment**. Stop.
*   **Only analyze the outermost verb.** The factivity of any inner verbs is irrelevant.

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify the Agents:**
    *   In the **Hypothesis**, identify the main agent.
    *   In the **Premise**, find the embedded clause that textually matches the entire Hypothesis and identify its agent.

2.  **Check for Agent Consistency (DECISIVE STEP):**
    *   Compare the two agents.
    *   **Rule:** If they are **different people**, the answer is **non-entailment**. **Stop here.**
    *   If they are the **same person**, proceed.

3.  **Analyze the Outermost Verb's Factivity:**
    *   Examine **only the outermost verb** in the Premise.
    *   **Rule:** If it is a **factive verb** (knows, remembers, learns, understands, recognizes, sees), the Hypothesis is **entailed**.
    *   **Rule:** If it is a **non-factive verb** (believes, assumes, suspects, thinks), the Hypothesis is **not entailed**.

**Options:**

2025-09-09 20:32:38,047 - 📊 Current Prompt:
Determine the logical relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis. Your task is to decide if the Premise logically entails the Hypothesis.

**Definition:**
- **Entailment (Yes):** The truth of the Premise **guarantees** the truth of the Hypothesis. If the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must absolutely be true.
- **Non-Entailment (No):** The Premise does not guarantee the Hypothesis's truth. The Hypothesis could be false even if the Premise is true.

**Crucial Guidelines for Reasoning:**
1.  **Focus on Logical Structure:** Ignore real-world truth. Focus solely on the logical relationship between the statements.
2.  **Nested Propositions (Layer Removal):** If the Premise is of the form **"[Person A] [verb] that [Person B] [verb] that [Proposition P]"**, this **ENTAILS** that **"[Person A] [verb] that [Proposition P]"**.
    - *Example: "John knows that Mary sees that the door is open" ENTAILS "John knows that the door is open."*
3.  **Compositional Entailment Within Beliefs:** If the embedded proposition `P` in the Premise **logically implies** a simpler proposition `Q`, then **"[Person] believes that P"** **ENTAILS** **"[Person] believes that Q"**.
    - *Example: "William believes that the man is sweeping with a red broom" ENTAILS "William believes that the man is sweeping."*
4.  **Agent Mismatch is Non-Entailment:** If the Premise is about Person A's belief about Person B, but the Hypothesis is about Person B's *actual* belief or a different person's belief, this is **NON-ENTAILMENT**.
    - *Example: "James thinks that Richard understands P" does NOT entail "Richard understands P".*
    - *Example: "Joseph believes P" does NOT entail "Emma believes P".*
5.  **Avoid Symmetry Assumptions:** Beliefs are not bidirectional. "A believes about B" does not imply "B believes about A".
6.  **Ignore Factivity:** Verbs like *knows* or *recognizes* imply truth, but this does not override the rules for agent mismatch or nesting.

**Final Reasoning Checklist (Apply in Order):**
Before answering, ensure you have considered:
1.  **Nesting:** Can layers be removed? (Guideline 2). If yes, entailment.
2.  **Agent Alignment:** Does the Hypothesis refer to the same agent's belief as the Premise? If not, it is non-entailment (Guideline 4).
3.  **Composition:** Only if agents match, does the embedded proposition imply the hypothesis? (Guideline 3).
4.  **Trap:** Am I considering real-world truth or psychology? If yes, re-focus on logical structure.

**Output Format:**
First, reason step-by-step according to the guidelines and checklist above. Then, on a new line, output your final answer as either <answer>entailment</answer> or <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

**Few-Shot Examples:**

Example 1 (Nesting Entailment):
Premise: "Isabella thinks that John remembers that P."
Hypothesis: "Isabella thinks that P."
Reasoning: Nested structure. Guideline 2 applies: "A thinks that B remembers that P" entails "A thinks that P".
<answer>entailment</answer>

Example 2 (Agent Mismatch Non-Entailment):
Premise: "Richard believes that Joseph knows that P."
Hypothesis: "Joseph knows that P."
Reasoning: Premise is about Richard's belief. Hypothesis is about Joseph's actual knowledge. Guideline 4: agent mismatch.
<answer>non-entailment</answer>

Example 3 (Compositional Entailment):
Premise: "William believes that the man is sweeping with a red broom."
Hypothesis: "William believes that the man is sweeping."
Reasoning: Agents match (William). The embedded proposition "sweeping with a red broom" logically implies "sweeping". Guideline 3 applies.

Follow these steps:
1. Parse the SVG path command-by-command (M, L, A, etc.) and list all distinct points that define the shape. Ignore redundant M commands that reposition to the current point.
2. Check if the path is closed (ends at the starting point or uses a Z command).
3. If the path contains only straight lines (L commands) and is closed, count the number of unique vertices to determine the polygon (e.g., 3 → triangle, 4 → quadrilateral, 5 → pentagon, 6 → hexagon, 7 → heptagon, 8 → octagon). For quadrilaterals, compute side lengths and angles to distinguish specific types (e.g., rectangle, kite, trapezoid). Use dot products to check for right angles (≈0) and allow numerical tolerance (±0.01).
4. If the path contains an arc (A command):
   - Check if the radii are equal (rx = ry → circular arc) or not (elliptical arc).
   - For circular arcs, compute chord length between endpoints. If chord ≈ 2×radius, endpoints are diametrical and two symmetric arcs form a full circle.
   - Determine if the arc is part of a sector (requires two radial L commands from center to endpoints).
   - Verify the center by computing distances from suspected center to arc start and end points.
5. Compare the inferred shape to the options and eliminate those that do not match. For polygons, ensure vertex count and properties align. For circular shapes, ensure no extraneous lines are present.
6. Output the answer in <answer>shape</answer> format.

Options: circle, heptagon, hexagon, kite, line, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, triangle

Name the geometric shape drawn by the SVG path from the given options.

Follow these steps:
1. Parse the SVG path command-by-command (M, L, A, etc.) and list all distinct points in connection order. Multiple subpaths form a single closed shape if endpoints connect logically.
2. Check if the path is closed (ends at starting point within ±0.01 tolerance or uses Z).
3. If only straight lines (L) and closed, count unique vertices (3→triangle, 4→quadrilateral, 5→pentagon, 6→hexagon, 7→heptagon, 8→octagon).
4. For quadrilaterals:
   - Compute vectors between points. If opposite sides are approximately parallel and equal (±0.01), it's a parallelogram.
   - If all angles ≈90° (dot products ±0.05), it's a rectangle.
   - If two pairs of adjacent sides are equal (±0.01), it's a kite.
   - If only one pair of sides is parallel, it's a trapezoid.
5. If the path contains an arc (A):
   - Check if radii are equal (circular arc).
   - Two arcs with equal radii connecting diametrically opposite points (chord length ≈2×radius) form a circle.
   - A sector requires two straight lines (L) from a center to arc endpoints.
6. Eliminate mismatches (no arcs → not circle/sector; wrong vertex count → not polygon).
7. Use approximate comparisons with tolerances due to floating-point precision.

Name the geometric shape drawn by the SVG path from the given options.

**Follow these steps precisely:**

1.  **Parse and List Points:** Extract all coordinates from the path commands (M, L, A, Z) in the order they are drawn.
2.  **Check for Closure:** The path is closed **only if** its final coordinate is exactly equal to its initial coordinate OR it ends with a `Z` command.
3.  **Check for Arcs:** If the path contains an `A` command, it is a curved shape. Proceed to Step 4. If it contains only `M`, `L`, and/or `Z`, it is a polygon. Proceed to Step 5.
4.  **Analyze Arcs:**
    - A single `A` command that forms a full 360° arc is a `circle`.
    - An `A` command connected to two `L` commands that meet at a central point is a `sector`.
    - Confirm the arc's x-radius and y-radius are equal (rx == ry).
5.  **Analyze Polygons:** For paths with only straight lines:
    - Compile a list of **all unique vertices** that define the closed shape. Ignore intermediate `M` commands if the final segment returns to the absolute start.
    - **Count the number of unique vertices.**
    - **3 vertices:** `triangle`
    - **4 vertices:** Calculate all side lengths. If two distinct pairs of **adjacent** sides are equal, it is a `kite`. If all angles are 90° (check via slopes), it is a `rectangle`.
    - **5 vertices:** `pentagon`
    - **6 vertices:** `hexagon`
    - **7 vertices:** `heptagon`
    - **8 vertices:** `octagon`
6.  **Eliminate Incorrect Options:** Immediately discard any option that does not match the properties you identified (e.g., number of sides, presence of curves).
7.  **Output:** Finalize your answer in the format: `<answer>shape</answer>`

Example 4:
Premise: "Sophia believes that Ava sees that a boy jumps on the beach."
Hypothesis: "Sophia believes that a boy jumps on the beach."
Reasoning: The outer verb is "believes" (non-factive), but the embedded clause contains the factive verb "sees". According to Guideline 3, "A believes that B sees that P" entails "A believes that P".
<answer>entailment</answer>

Example 5:
Premise: "Isabella knows that a man is in front of a dryer in a laundromat with both hands reaching into a bin or basket."
Hypothesis: "Isabella knows that a man reaches into his laundry basket at the laundromat."
Reasoning: The verb "knows" is factive. The embedded proposition P describes a man reaching into a bin/basket. In this context, "a bin or basket" is a laundry receptacle, and "his" is a natural anaphoric inference from "a man". Therefore, P entails the proposition in the hypothesis. According to Guideline 4, "Knows(P)" entails "Knows(Q)".

Determine whether the Premise entails the Hypothesis by following these steps:

1.  **Identify Structure and Agents:** Identify all agents and their mental state verbs (e.g., knows, believes, assumes, remembers, suspects, understands, recognizes) in both the Premise and the Hypothesis. Note the nesting of clauses.

2.  **Establish Factive Context:** If the outermost verb in the Premise is **factive** (e.g., knows, remembers, recognizes, sees), treat its entire embedded clause as a **TRUE FACT** about the world. Your analysis must now reason from this established factual scenario.

3.  **Deconstruct and Analyze Clauses:** Analyze the internal content of the embedded clauses.
    *   **Resolve Coreference:** Identify what all pronouns (e.g., he, she, it, they) refer to. The properties of the referent (like gender) are part of the meaning.
    *   **Identify Lexical and Pragmatic Entailments:** Note if words inherently entail other properties (e.g., "bachelor" entails "unmarried") or carry backgrounded information (e.g., "stop running" presupposes "was running before"). Crucially, also identify **pragmatic and contextual entailments** (e.g., "in a sauna" entails "in a room"; "dressed only in a towel" in a sauna context pragmatically entails a state of undress equivalent to "not wearing any [conventional] clothes").

4.  **Check for Entailment of the Scenario:** Determine if the **meaning** of the Hypothesis's embedded clause is logically contained within or accurately describes the **factual scenario** established by the Premise's relevant embedded clause, based on Step 3.
    *   For factive contexts, ask: "Does the Hypothesis provide a **valid description** of the true scenario from the Premise, even if using different words?" Consider spatial relationships, common-sense implications, and contextual meanings.
    *   If yes, proceed to the next step to verify the agent and verb context.
    *   If no, proceed to Step 5.

5.  **Analyze the Verb Chain for Factivity:** Examine the verbs from the outermost to the innermost.
    *   **Rule 1:** If the outermost verb is **factive**, it presupposes the truth of its embedded clause. If the Hypothesis is a valid description of this clause's scenario, the answer is **entailment**.
    *   **Rule 2:** If the outermost verb is **non-factive** (e.g., believes, assumes, suspects), it does not guarantee the truth of its embedded clause. However, you MUST analyze the next verb in the chain.
        *   If a subsequent verb in the embedded clause is **factive**, then the main agent's belief **entails that they believe the factive verb's embedded clause to be true**.
        *   *Example: "A believes that B knows X" entails "A believes X" because "knows" is factive.*
        *   If all subsequent verbs are also **non-factive**, then the main agent only believes in the subordinate agent's mental state, not necessarily the underlying fact.
        *   *Example: "A believes that B believes X" does **not** entail "A believes X".*

6.  **Check for Semantic and Contextual Equivalence:** If the Hypothesis and the Premise's relevant clause have the same agent and mental state verb but different descriptions, determine if the descriptions are semantically or contextually equivalent for the purpose of the proposition (e.g., "a man in a towel" in a sauna context entails "a human without [other] clothes"). If so, the Hypothesis is entailed.

**Final Determination:**
- **entailment:** If the Premise logically guarantees the truth of the Hypothesis based on the rules above.
- **non-entailment:** If the Premise does not guarantee the Hypothesis.

### Critical Examples for Guidance: ###

[Example: Correct Entailment - Factive Scene Description]
Premise: Thomas recognizes that a boy in a green shirt surrounded by toys and another boy, wearing a blue shirt with penguins, to his left.
Hypothesis: Thomas recognizes that two boys sit in a classroom at their desks.
Analysis: "Recognizes" is factive, so the Premise's scene is TRUE. This scene describes two boys in a specific arrangement. "Two boys" is directly entailed. The spatial relation "to his left" strongly implies they are seated or positioned at a desk-like structure. "Surrounded by toys" is consistent with a classroom setting (e.g., a kindergarten). The Hypothesis is a valid description of the true scenario established by the Premise.
<answer>entailment</answer>

[Example: Correct Entailment - Pragmatic Entailment]
Premise: Olivia suspects that a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna.
Hypothesis: Olivia suspects that a human not wearing any clothes is in a room.
Analysis: The main verb "suspects" is non-factive. The embedded clauses are compared. "A man" entails "a human". "In a sauna" contextually entails "in a room". Crucially, in the context of a sauna, "dressed only in a towel" pragmatically describes a state of undress equivalent to "not wearing any [conventional] clothes". The descriptions are contextually equivalent. The agent and verb match.

[Example: Non-Entailment - Double Non-Factive]
Premise: Ava believes that Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit.
Hypothesis: Ava believes that three kids perform a skit.
Analysis: The main verb "believes" is non-factive. The next verb "suspects" is also non-factive. Therefore, Ava only believes that Emma has a suspicion, not that the event is true.
<answer>non-entailment</answer>

[Example: Non-Entailment - Agent Mismatch]
Premise: Taylor knows that a cyclist is biking.
Hypothesis: Richard knows that a cyclist is biking.
Analysis: The agents are different (Taylor vs. Richard). The Premise is about Taylor's knowledge and does not imply anything about Richard's knowledge.

[Example: Non-Entailment - Missing Presupposition Lift]
Premise: Alex believes that the programmer has stopped fixing the bug.
Hypothesis: Alex believes that the programmer was fixing the bug.
Analysis: The Premise's clause "has stopped fixing" presupposes that the programmer *was* fixing the bug. However, the main verb "believes" is non-factive. A belief about a stoppage does not entail a belief about the prior activity; Alex could be mistaken about the entire situation. The verb chain does not contain a factive verb to lift this presupposition to the level of Alex's belief.

Determine whether the Premise entails the Hypothesis by following these steps:

**Key Principles:**
*   **Agent Consistency for Mental States:** If the Hypothesis is about a mental state (e.g., "X believes that P"), the main agent (X) must be the same in both Premise and Hypothesis for entailment to be possible. A belief about another person's mental state is not the same as holding that mental state directly.
*   **Factivity:** Factive verbs (e.g., *knows, remembers, recognizes, learns, understands, realizes*) presuppose the truth of their embedded clause. Non-factive verbs (e.g., *believes, assumes, thinks, suspects*) do not.
*   **Belief-World Analysis:** When a factive statement is embedded within a belief (e.g., "X believes that Y knows P"), the believer (X) is committed to the truth of the embedded clause (P) *within their own belief world*.
*   **Literal Embedding of Facts:** If the entire Hypothesis is the exact embedded clause of a **factive** verb in the Premise, the Premise entails the Hypothesis, **even if the main agents are different**.
*   **Semantic Analysis & Coreference:** The embedded clause in the Premise may semantically entail the embedded clause in the Hypothesis through world knowledge (e.g., "sweeping with a broom" entails "sweeping dirt"). Pronouns (he, she, it, they) refer back to nouns already introduced in the sentence.

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify Main Structure:**
    *   Identify the main agent (A1) and mental state verb (V1) in the Hypothesis.
    *   Identify the main agent (A2) and mental state verb (V2) in the Premise.
    *   **Rule 1a (Mental State Hypothesis):** If the Hypothesis is about a mental state (A1 V1 that...), and A1 is not the same as A2, the answer is immediately **non-entailment**. Stop.
    *   **Rule 1b (Factual Hypothesis):** If the Hypothesis is a raw fact (e.g., "a dog is running"), proceed to Step 4.
    *   If A1 and A2 are the same, proceed.

2.  **Compare Belief Content:**
    *   Extract the entire embedded clause from the Hypothesis (C_hyp).
    *   Extract the entire embedded clause from the Premise (C_prem).
    *   **Rule 2a (Identity):** If C_prem is identical to C_hyp, the answer is **entailment**. Stop.
    *   **Rule 2b (Semantics & Coreference):** If C_prem is not identical to C_hyp, check for:
        *   **Lexical Entailment:** Does the content of C_prem semantically imply C_hyp based on world knowledge? (e.g., "sweeping with a broom" -> "sweeping dirt").
        *   **Pronoun Resolution:** Does a pronoun in C_prem (e.g., "she") corefer with a noun that validates C_hyp? (e.g., "a gymnast... she performs" -> "the gymnast is a woman").
        *   If yes, the answer is **entailment**. Stop.
    *   If not, proceed.

3.  **Analyze Nested Constructions (The Core Fix):**
    *   This step applies when C_prem has its own mental state verb (e.g., "Sophia recognizes that P").
    *   **Rule 3a (Non-factive V2):** If the main Premise verb (V2) is **non-factive** (believes, assumes, thinks, suspects):
        *   Analyze the inner verb in C_prem (V3).
        *   If V3 is **factive** (knows, recognizes, learns, remembers), then "A2 V2 that [A3 V3 P]" means that *within A2's belief world, P is true*. Therefore, if C_hyp is P, the answer is **entailment**.
        *   If V3 is **non-factive**, then "A2 V2 that [A3 V3 P]" does NOT mean A2 believes P. The answer is **non-entailment**.
    *   **Rule 3b (Factive V2):** If V2 is **factive** (knows, remembers), then its embedded clause (C_prem) is true. Now analyze V3 in C_prem:
        *   If V3 is **factive**, then P is true. If C_hyp is P, the answer is **entailment**.
        *   If V3 is **non-factive**, then "A3 V3 P" is true, but P may not be. The answer is **non-entailment**.

4.  **Check for Literal Embedding (For Factual Hypotheses):**
    *   **Rule 4:** This step is only for when the Hypothesis (C_hyp) is a raw fact.
    *   If the Premise is "A2 V2 that X", and V2 is **factive**, and X is **identical** to C_hyp, then the answer is **entailment**.
    *   If V2 is non-factive, the answer is **non-entailment**.

**Critical Examples to Avoid Past Mistakes:**

-   **Example A (Belief-World Entailment):**
    Premise: Robert believes that Sophia recognizes that P.
    Hypothesis: Robert believes that P.
    Analysis: Main agent same (Robert). V2 "believes" is non-factive. C_prem has inner factive verb "recognizes". Within Robert's belief, P is true. Answer: **entailment**.

-   **Example B (Semantic Entailment):**
    Premise: William believes that the man is sweeping with a red broom.
    Hypothesis: William believes that the man is sweeping dirt.
    Analysis: Main agent same (William). C_prem ("sweeping with a broom") semantically entails C_hyp ("sweeping dirt") via world knowledge. Answer: **entailment**.

-   **Example C (Coreference):**
    Premise: Olivia suspects that a gymnast is seen defying gravity as she performs...
    Hypothesis: Olivia suspects that the gymnast is a woman.
    Analysis: Main agent same (Olivia). The pronoun "she" in C_prem corefers with "a gymnast", entailing the gymnast is female. Answer: **entailment**.

-   **Example D (Literal Embedding):**
    Premise: David remembers that Richard assumes that P.
    Hypothesis: Richard assumes that P.
    Analysis: Main agents are different (David vs. Richard). However, the Hypothesis is the exact embedded clause of the factive verb "remembers". The Premise asserts that "Richard assumes that P" is true. Answer: **entailment**.

-   **Example E (Non-Entailment):**
    Premise: Emma thinks that Charlotte believes that P.
    Hypothesis: Emma thinks that P.
    Analysis: Main agent same (Emma). V2 "thinks" is non-factive. Inner verb "believes" is non-factive. Believing that someone believes P does not entail believing P yourself. Answer: **non-entailment**.

Determine whether the Premise entails the Hypothesis by following these steps:

**Key Principles:**
*   Ignore the specific event described (e.g., "a girl bounces"). Focus solely on the structure of mental state attributions (e.g., "knows", "believes") and their agents.
*   Always analyze the structure from the outside in. The outermost agent and verb are the most important.
*   A belief about another person's knowledge is not the same as holding that belief directly.

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify the Root Structure:**
    *   In the **Hypothesis**, identify the main agent (the root subject) and their mental state verb (the root verb).
    *   In the **Premise**, find the clause that has the **identical root agent and root verb**. This is your starting point.
    *   **Example:** If the Hypothesis is "**Abigail believes** that P", find "**Abigail believes** that ..." in the Premise.

2.  **Compare the Embedded Clauses:**
    *   Look at the clause that is embedded under the root agent/verb pair you found in the Premise.
    *   **Rule A: Direct Match.** If this embedded clause is **identical** to the embedded clause in the Hypothesis, then the Premise entails the Hypothesis. Answer **entailment**.
    *   **Rule B: Nested Mental State.** If this embedded clause contains **another mental state verb** (e.g., "John learns that P"), then you must analyze this inner verb. Proceed to Step 3.

3.  **Analyze the Inner Verb's Factivity:**
    *   Examine the inner mental state verb found in the previous step.
    *   **Rule B1: Factive Inner Verb.** If the inner verb is **factive** (knows, remembers, learns, understands), it presupposes the truth of its clause (P). Therefore, the Premise entails the Hypothesis. Answer **entailment**.
    *   **Rule B2: Non-Factive Inner Verb.** If the inner verb is **non-factive** (believes, assumes, suspects, thinks), it does not guarantee the truth of its clause (P). Therefore, the Premise does **not** entail the Hypothesis. Answer **non-entailment**.

**Critical Examples to Avoid Past Mistakes:**

*   **Example A (Leads to Entailment):**
    Premise: Emma thinks that Charlotte **remembers** that the team is getting instruction.
    Hypothesis: Emma thinks that the team is getting instruction.
    *   **Root Match:** "Emma thinks" in both.
    *   **Embedded Clause in Premise:** "Charlotte remembers that P"
    *   **Analysis:** "Remembers" is **factive**. Therefore, **entailment**.

*   **Example B (Leads to Entailment):**
    Premise: Abigail believes that John **learns** that two people kiss.
    Hypothesis: Abigail believes that two people kiss.
    *   **Root Match:** "Abigail believes" in both.
    *   **Embedded Clause in Premise:** "John learns that P"
    *   **Analysis:** "Learns" is **factive**. Therefore, **entailment**.

*   **Example C (Leads to Non-Entailment):**
    Premise: Ava believes that Emma **suspects** that three kids perform a skit.
    Hypothesis: Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit.
    *   **Root Match:** The Premise's root is "Ava believes", but the Hypothesis's root is "Emma suspects". These are **not** the same root structure. The correct root to find in the Premise for this Hypothesis would be "Emma suspects". Since we cannot find it, we analyze the embedded clause under "Ava believes": "Emma suspects that P".
    *   **Analysis:** "Suspects" is **non-factive**. Therefore, **non-entailment**.

**Options:**
- entailment
- non-entailment

**Revised Prompt for Entailment Task**

Determine the logical relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis. Your task is to decide if the Premise logically entails the Hypothesis.

**Definition:**
- **Entailment (Yes):** The truth of the Premise **guarantees** the truth of the Hypothesis. If the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must absolutely be true.
- **Non-Entailment (No):** The Premise does not guarantee the Hypothesis's truth. The Hypothesis could be false even if the Premise is true.

**Crucial Guidelines for Reasoning:**
1.  **Focus on Linguistic Meaning:** Ignore real-world plausibility (e.g., whether a bench is likely near an ocean). However, **you MUST account for the inherent meaning of the verbs used** (e.g., "knows" implies truth, "believes" does not). This is part of the logical structure.
2.  **Nested Propositions (Layer Removal):** If the Premise is of the form **"[Person A] [verb] that [Person B] [verb] that [Proposition P]"**, this **ENTAILS** that **"[Person A] [verb] that [Proposition P]"**.
    - *Example: "John knows that Mary sees that the door is open" ENTAILS "John knows that the door is open."*
3.  **Compositional Entailment Within Attitudes:** If the embedded proposition `P` in the Premise **logically implies** a simpler proposition `Q`, then:
    - **"[Person] believes/thinks that P"** **ENTAILS** **"[Person] believes/thinks that Q"**.
    - **"[Person] knows/remembers that P"** **ENTAILS** **"[Person] knows/remembers that Q"**.
    - *Example: "William believes that the man is sweeping with a red broom" ENTAILS "William believes that the man is sweeping."*
4.  **Agent Mismatch and Verb Factivity (CRUCIAL):**
    -   **For Non-Factive Verbs (e.g., thinks, believes, assumes):**
        - If the Premise is about Person A's attitude, but the Hypothesis is about Person B's *actual* attitude or a different person's attitude, this is **NON-ENTAILMENT**.
        - *Example: "James thinks that Richard understands P" does NOT entail "Richard understands P".*
    -   **For Factive Verbs (e.g., knows, remembers, recognizes):**
        - These verbs imply the truth of their embedded clause.
        - Therefore, **"[Person A] [factive-verb] that [Person B] [verb] that P"** **ENTAILS** that **"[Person B] [verb] that P"** is true.
        - *Example: "William remembers that Thomas believes P" ENTAILS "Thomas believes P".*
    -   **Different Agents, Same Verb:** "Joseph believes P" does NOT entail "Emma believes P".
5.  **Avoid Symmetry Assumptions:** Beliefs are not bidirectional. "A believes about B" does not imply "B believes about A".

**Final Reasoning Checklist:**
Before answering, ensure you have considered:
1.  **Verb Type:** Is the main verb factive (knows, remembers) or non-factive (thinks, believes)? This determines which rule to apply for agent mismatch (Guideline 4).
2.  **Nesting:** Can layers be removed? (Guideline 2).
3.  **Agent Alignment:** Does the Hypothesis refer to the same agent's attitude? If not, apply the correct rule from Guideline 4 based on verb factivity.
4.  **Composition:** Only if the attitude is about the same agent (or factivity applies), does the embedded proposition `P` logically imply the proposition in the hypothesis `Q`? (Guideline 3).

**Output Format:**
First, reason step-by-step according to the guidelines above. Then, on a new line, output your final answer as either <answer>entailment</answer> or <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

**Few-Shot Examples:**

Example 1 (Nesting Entailment):
Premise: "Isabella thinks that John remembers that P."
Hypothesis: "Isabella thinks that P."
Reasoning: Nested structure. Guideline 2 applies: "A thinks that B remembers that P" entails "A thinks that P".
<answer>entailment</answer>

Example 2 (Agent Mismatch with Non-Factive Verb):
Premise: "Richard believes that Joseph knows that P."
Hypothesis: "Joseph knows that P."
Reasoning: Premise is about Richard's belief (non-factive verb). Hypothesis is about Joseph's actual knowledge. Guideline 4 for non-factive verbs: agent mismatch leads to non-entailment.
<answer>non-entailment</answer>

Example 3 (Agent Mismatch with Factive Verb - CRITICAL EXAMPLE):
Premise: "William remembers that Thomas believes that a little boy with a red baseball cap is on a bus."
Hypothesis: "Thomas believes that a little boy with a red baseball cap is on a bus."
Reasoning: The main verb "remembers" is factive. Guideline 4 for factive verbs states: "A remembers that B believes P" ENTAILS "B believes P". Therefore, the Premise guarantees the truth of the Hypothesis.
<answer>entailment</answer>

Example 4 (Compositional Entailment with Factive Verb):
Premise: "Robert knows that a young woman is reading a book and drinking in the sun, seated on a bench."
Hypothesis: "Robert knows that a young woman reads."
Reasoning: The main verb "knows" is factive. The embedded proposition P ("a young woman is reading a book and drinking...") logically implies Q ("a young woman reads"). Therefore, by Guideline 3, "knows that P" entails "knows that Q". The additional details ("in the sun", "on a bench") do not contradict the core action of reading.
<answer>entailment</answer>

Example 5 (Different Agent Non-Entailment):
Premise: "Emma remembers that P."
Hypothesis: "James remembers that P."
Reasoning: Different agents (Emma vs. James). Guideline 4: no structural link between different agents' mental states.

Determine the logical relationship between the Premise and the Hypothesis. Your task is to decide if the Premise logically entails the Hypothesis.

**Definition:**
- **Entailment (Yes):** The truth of the Premise **guarantees** the truth of the Hypothesis. If the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must absolutely be true.
- **Non-Entailment (No):** The Premise does not guarantee the Hypothesis's truth. The Hypothesis could be false even if the Premise is true.

**Crucial Guidelines for Reasoning:**
1.  **Focus on Logical Structure, Ignore Real-World Truth:** Evaluate the relationship based **only** on the information given in the text and the rules of logic below. Do not use external world knowledge to judge if the statements are plausible or true. The described scenarios are to be taken at face value.
2.  **Primary Decision Rule: Identify the Main Verb's Factivity:**
    - Locate the primary cognitive verb in the Premise (e.g., *knows, believes, assumes, recognizes, suspects*).
    - **Factive verbs** (e.g., *knows, recognizes, sees, understands, remembers*) **presuppose the truth** of their embedded clause.
    - **Non-factive verbs** (e.g., *assumes, believes, suspects, thinks*) **do not presuppose** the truth of their embedded clause.
3.  **Structural Analysis: Compare to the Hypothesis:**
    - **If the Hypothesis is the exact proposition embedded under the Premise's main verb:**
        - **Factive Main Verb -> ENTAILMENT**
        - **Non-Factive Main Verb -> NON-ENTAILMENT**
    - **If not,** proceed to analyze nested structures or compositional entailment (Guidelines 4 & 5).
4.  **Decomposition of Nested Beliefs (CRITICAL RULE):**
    - If the Premise contains a nested cognitive verb (e.g., "A believes that B **knows** that P"), analyze the entailments **within the belief context**.
    - **If the embedded clause (e.g., "B knows that P") logically entails a simpler proposition (e.g., "P") due to the factivity of the nested verb**, then the entire Premise entails the version where the agent believes that simpler proposition.
    - **This rule applies regardless of whether the main verb is factive or non-factive.** The key is the logical relationship *inside* the attributed belief or assumption.
    - *Example:* "Sophia **believes** that Ava **sees** that P" -> The embedded "Ava sees that P" entails "P". Therefore, the Premise entails "Sophia **believes** that P".
5.  **Compositional Entailment Within Propositions:**
    - If the proposition `P` embedded under a cognitive verb **logically or semantically entails** a proposition `Q`, then `[Person] [verb] that P` entails `[Person] [verb] that Q`.
    - This includes:
        - **Logical Entailment:** Conjunction elimination (e.g., "P and Q" -> "P").
        - **Semantic Entailment:** Hyponymy (e.g., "a dog" -> "an animal"), meronymy (e.g., "a wheel" -> "part of a car").
        - **Anaphoric and Pragmatic Inferences:** Make reasonable, context-based inferences from the text provided. For descriptive hypotheses, treat the Premise's description as a complete definition of a scene. If the description pragmatically implies the Hypothesis, it is an entailment (e.g., "a boy in a green shirt and another boy" -> "two boys are present"; "a man" -> "his").

**Final Reasoning Checklist:**
Before answering, ensure you have considered:
1.  **Main Verb & Factivity:** What is the main cognitive verb? Is it factive or non-factive?
2.  **Direct Match:** Is the Hypothesis the exact embedded proposition? If yes, apply the Primary Rule.
3.  **Nesting & Decomposition:** If not, does the embedded clause contain a factive verb that entails a simpler proposition? If yes, apply the Decomposition Rule (Guideline 4).
4.  **Composition:** Does the embedded proposition `P` logically or pragmatically entail the proposition `Q` in the Hypothesis? (Guideline 5).

**Output Format:**
First, reason step-by-step according to the guidelines above. Then, on a new line, output your final answer as either <answer>entailment</answer> or <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

**Few-Shot Examples:**

Example 1 (Direct Match - Non-Factive):
Premise: "Taylor suspects that Isabella thinks that a child is sitting on the grass."
Hypothesis: "Isabella thinks that a child is sitting on the grass."
Reasoning: The main verb of the Premise is "suspects", which is non-factive. The Hypothesis is the exact proposition embedded under "suspects". Therefore, by the Primary Decision Rule, this is non-entailment.
<answer>non-entailment</answer>

Example 2 (Nested Decomposition - Corrected):
Premise: "Sophia believes that Ava sees that a boy jumps on the beach."
Hypothesis: "Sophia believes that a boy jumps on the beach."
Reasoning: The main verb is "believes" (non-factive). The Hypothesis is not an exact match. The embedded clause is "Ava sees that a boy jumps on the beach". The verb "sees" is factive, so "Ava sees that P" logically entails "P". Therefore, by the Decomposition Rule (Guideline 4), "Sophia believes that [Ava sees that P]" entails "Sophia believes that P".
<answer>entailment</answer>

Example 3 (Compositional Entailment - Description):
Premise: "Thomas recognizes that a boy in a green shirt is surrounded by toys and another boy, wearing a blue shirt with penguins, is to his left."
Hypothesis: "Thomas recognizes that two boys sit in a classroom at their desks."
Reasoning: The main verb is "recognizes" (factive). The Hypothesis is not an exact match. The embedded description in the Premise pragmatically defines a scene containing two boys. The added details "in a classroom at their desks" are a consistent, summarizing interpretation of the scene described ("surrounded by toys" could be in a classroom). Based on Guideline 5 and the instruction to ignore real-world truth, this is a valid pragmatic inference within the context.
<answer>entailment</answer>

Example 4 (Nested Decomposition - Corrected):
Premise: "Charlotte assumes that Joseph understands that a white greyhound dog wearing a muzzle runs around a track."
Hypothesis: "Charlotte assumes that a white greyhound dog wearing a muzzle runs around a track."
Reasoning: The main verb is "assumes" (non-factive). The Hypothesis is not an exact match. The embedded clause is "Joseph understands that P". The verb "understands" is factive, so "Joseph understands that P" logically entails "P". Therefore, by the Decomposition Rule (Guideline 4), "Charlotte assumes that [Joseph understands that P]" entails "Charlotte assumes that P".
<answer>entailment</answer>

Example 5 (Non-Entailment - No Decomposition):
Premise: "David believes that his child suspects that the monster is under the bed."
Hypothesis: "David believes that the monster is under the bed."
Reasoning: The main verb is "believes" (non-factive). The Hypothesis is not an exact match. The embedded clause is "his child suspects that P". The verb "suspects" is non-factive; it does not entail "P". Therefore, the Decomposition Rule does not apply. There is no other logical path from the Premise to the Hypothesis.
<answer>non-entailment</answer>
Hypothesis: Charles suspects that two guys on a couch, one is looking up the other is looking away with a cup in his hand.
Reasoning: Outer verb "suspects" (non-factive) embeds inner verb "thinks" (non-factive). Charles's suspicion is about Taylor's mental state, not the truth of the proposition itself. No entailment.
Answer: non-entailment

Premise: Richard learns that Isabella thinks that a man looks mysterious in a blue shirt and a red truck for a company called Wilbert.
Hypothesis: Isabella thinks that a man looks mysterious in a blue shirt and a red truck for a company called Wilbert.
Reasoning: "Learns" is a reporting verb, so it guarantees that Isabella does think X. Entailment holds.
Answer: entailment

**Now, apply this reasoning:**

Premise: {premise}
Hypothesis: {hypothesis}
Options: entailment, non-entailment

Think step by step. Then output your final answer as <answer>entailment</answer> or <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis. Follow these steps:

1.  **Decompose the statements.** Identify all agents and the exact propositions attributed to them at each level. Note the specific verbs used (e.g., *knows, sees, learns, believes, thinks*).

2.  **Analyze verb factivity:**
    *   A **factive verb** (e.g., *knows, realizes, sees, learns, understands, remembers*) means its embedded proposition is **true**.
    *   A **non-factive verb** (e.g., *believes, suspects, thinks, assumes*) means its embedded proposition is **not confirmed as true**; it only represents a belief.

3.  **Apply the Critical Belief Embedding Rules:**
    *   **Outer Verb Containment Principle:** The factivity of the **outermost verb** determines whether the entire embedded proposition can be treated as true. A non-factive outer verb means that even factive embedded statements cannot be assumed to be true in reality.
    *   **Agent Transfer Prohibition:** If the top-level agent in the premise and hypothesis are different, entailment is immediately broken. The premise only provides information about its stated agent.
    *   **Factive Belief Entailment:** If the premise states that **Agent A believes a factive statement** (e.g., "Agent B **knows/sees/learns** that P"), then this **entails** that Agent A believes P. *Reasoning: To believe someone knows a fact is to believe the fact itself.*
    *   **Non-Factive Belief Block:** If the premise states that **Agent A believes a non-factive statement** (e.g., "Agent B **believes/thinks/suspects** that P"), then this **does not entail** that Agent A believes P. *Reasoning: Agent A can believe Agent B holds a belief without sharing it.*

4.  **Compare the core propositions.** For entailment, the proposition that the top-level agent believes in the hypothesis must be logically equivalent to or a necessary consequence of the proposition embedded in the premise.
    *   For **factive statements**, allow minor syntactic variations (reordering of clauses, passive/active voice) that preserve the same factual content.
    *   For **non-factive statements**, do not make contextual inferences about the embedded content, as its truth is not established.

5.  **Final Judgment:** Conclude "entailment" **only if** the premise, under the rules above, logically ensures the hypothesis is true. If any doubt remains, the answer is "non-entailment."

After your reasoning, provide your final answer within <answer> tags.

**Examples:**
Premise: William assumes that Emma sees that a dog is running.

Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis. Follow these steps:

1.  **Decompose** both statements. Identify all agents and the exact propositions attributed to them at each level. Note the specific verbs used (e.g., *knows, believes, sees, remembers*) and classify each as **factive** or **non-factive**.

2.  **Compare meticulously.**
    *   **Agent Invariant:** The outermost agent must be the same for entailment to be possible. If the agent changes, entailment is broken. **Stop reasoning.**
    *   **Factive Verb Rule:** A **factive** verb (e.g., *knows, realizes, sees, remembers, recognizes*) means its embedded proposition is **true**. A **non-factive** verb (e.g., *believes, suspects, thinks, assumes*) does not confirm the truth of its embedded proposition.

3.  **Apply the Critical Entailment Rule for Beliefs:**
    *   If the premise states that **Agent A believes** that **Agent B VERB [that P]**, then:
        *   If VERB is **factive**, then `A believes that B VERB [that P]` **entails** `A believes that P`. This is because A cannot consistently believe B's factive attitude about P without themselves believing P to be true.
        *   If VERB is **non-factive**, then `A believes that B VERB [that P]` **does NOT entail** `A believes that P`. A can believe that B holds a belief without sharing that belief.
    *   This rule also applies if the embedded factive verb is attributed to the same agent (e.g., "A knows that P" entails "A believes that P").

4.  **Non-Factive Barrier Rule:** If the premise uses a non-factive verb, you **cannot** conclude that its embedded proposition is true or that the agent within it actually holds the stated belief.

5.  **Check for Semantic Equivalence:** For the embedded proposition P, or if dealing with a simple belief, the hypothesis must be a logical consequence of the premise. Use commonsense reasoning for paraphrases and inferences that are unambiguous given world knowledge. **This is a final check, only applied after all structural rules are satisfied.**

6.  **Final Judgment:** Conclude "entailment" **only if** the premise directly and logically makes the hypothesis true after applying the rules above. If any genuine doubt exists, the answer is "non-entailment."

    *   A **non-factive** verb (e.g., *believes, suspects, thinks, assumes*) means its embedded proposition is **not confirmed as true**; it only confirms the attitude exists.
4.  **Apply the belief transfer rule for factive embeddings:**
    *   If the premise states that **Agent A [non-factive verb]** that **Agent B [factive verb]** that X, then this **entails** that **Agent A [non-factive verb] that X**.
    *   *Reasoning: Believing that someone knows/remembers/sees a fact inherently means you believe the fact itself.*
    *   **This rule does not apply if the inner verb is non-factive.** `Agent A believes that Agent B believes X` does **not** entail `Agent A believes X`.
    *   **This rule only transfers belief to the outer agent.** It cannot establish facts about the inner agent (e.g., from `A believes B knows X` you cannot conclude `B knows X`, only `A believes X`).
5.  **Check for semantic entailment within the same modal context:** The embedded proposition in the hypothesis must be a logical consequence of the embedded proposition in the premise **within the same agent's belief world**. You may perform **limited, unambiguous semantic inference**:
    *   **Hyponymy:** A specific term entails a general term (e.g., "sauna" → "room"; "spaniel" → "dog").
    *   **Meronymy:** A whole entails its parts (e.g., "reading a book and drinking" → "reading").
    *   **Synonymy/Logical Equivalence:** "man" → "human"; "not wearing any clothes" is logically equivalent to "naked".
    *   **Functional entailment:** If an object is inherently defined by its function, using it for that function entails the typical outcome (e.g., "sweeping with a broom" entails "sweeping dirt/debris"; "writing with a pen" entails "producing text").
    *   **Pragmatic entailment:** If a phrase conventionally implies another in common usage, it may entail it (e.g., "dressed only in a towel" pragmatically entails "not wearing conventional clothes").
    *   **Do not** make leaps that require specific factual knowledge or are not directly inferable from the terms. If the connection is not direct and unambiguous in common interpretation, do not infer it.
6.  **Semantic entailment is confined to its context.** An entailment relationship within a belief (e.g., `X entails Y` in Agent B's mind) cannot be transferred to a different agent's belief (e.g., `Agent A believes that Agent B believes X` does not entail `Agent A believes Y`).
7.  **Require strict establishment.** Conclude "entailment" **only if** the premise, via the rules above, makes the hypothesis true. If any doubt exists, the answer is "non-entailment."

**Critical Examples for Reference:**
Premise: Charles suspects that Olivia knows that three men stand on a sidewalk.
Hypothesis: Olivia knows that three men stand on a sidewalk.
<answer>non-entailment</answer>
*Reasoning: Main agent changes (Charles → Olivia). "Suspects" is non-factive. Rule 4 does not apply to establish Olivia's actual knowledge.*

Premise: Charlotte assumes that Michael assumes that the guitarist performs a solo.
Hypothesis: Michael assumes that the guitarist performs a solo.
<answer>non-entailment</answer>
*Reasoning: Main agent changes (Charlotte → Michael). "Assumes" is non-factive. Rule 4 does not apply.*

Premise: James understands that William suspects that a woman sits on a bench.
Hypothesis: William suspects that James understands that a woman sits on a bench.
<answer>non-entailment</answer>
*Reasoning: Main agent changes (James → William). Beliefs are not symmetric; premise gives no information about William's beliefs regarding James.*
entails the Hypothesis. Entailment means that if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true.

**CRITICAL: Always reason from your external perspective as the evaluator. The Premise is taken as true in the real world of this task. Do not reason from within a character's belief state.**

Pay special attention to sentences involving mental states like "knows," "believes," "assumes," "suspects," or "recognizes."

**Reasoning Steps:**
1.  **Identify the main subject (S1) and their mental state verb** in the Premise. Note the **strength** of the verb:
    *   **Strong/Committed:** knows, believes, is certain, recognizes (factive).
    *   **Weak/Uncertain:** suspects, assumes, thinks, doubts.
2.  **Extract the complete embedded proposition. Resolve any pronouns** (e.g., "she" implies the subject is female) based strictly on the text of the Premise. **Critically, identify any verbs *within* the embedded proposition and note if they are factive** (e.g., knows, learns, sees, recognizes). A factive verb presupposes the truth of its embedded clause.
3.  **For iterated attitudes (e.g., "S1 Verb1 that S2 Verb2 that P"):**
    *   **If Verb1 is Strong:** Inferring "S1 Verb1 that P" is **typically valid**. (e.g., "knows that believes" → entails "believes").
    *   **If Verb1 is Weak:** Inferring "S1 Verb1 that P" is **typically NOT valid**. (e.g., "suspects that thinks" → does **not** entail "suspects"). S1's uncertainty about S2's state does not mean S1 holds that state themselves.
    *   **CRITICAL EXCEPTION:** **If Verb2 is Factive** (knows, learns, sees, recognizes), then "S1 Verb1 that S2 [Factive Verb] that P" **DOES entail** "S1 Verb1 that P". This is because the factivity of Verb2 "bleeds up"; to have any attitude about someone *knowing/seeing* P logically requires holding that same attitude towards P itself.
    *   **Never change the subject:** From "S1 Verb1 that S2 Verb2 that P", you can **never** infer "S2 Verb2 that P" as a fact. You can only make inferences about S1's mental state.
4.  **For factive verbs** (e.g., "knows", "recognizes"), the embedded proposition P is true. You can use P as a fact for reasoning about the real world.
5.  **Apply commonsense and semantic reasoning from the subject's perspective:**
    *   The Premise defines S1's belief world. If the Hypothesis adds a detail, ask: "Given what S1 knows/believes, is this new detail a **necessary and direct implication**?"
    *   **Pay attention to word meanings:** For example, "to know P" means "P is true". Therefore, "S1 believes that S2 knows P" means "S1 believes that P is true".
    *   Entailment holds **only if the detail is virtually inescapable**. If it's merely possible but not required, entailment does not hold.
6.  Ignore minor syntactic differences; focus on semantic equivalence.

**Examples for Guidance:**

**Example 1 (Entailment - Strong Nested Attitude):**
Premise: Olivia knows that Taylor believes that people in bathing suits bend down.
Hypothesis: Olivia believes that people in bathing suits bend down.
Reasoning: **Iterated attitude with a strong primary verb ('knows'). Olivia's knowledge of Taylor's belief implies Olivia herself holds that belief.**
Answer: entailment

**Example 2 (Entailment - Pronoun Resolution):**
Premise: Olivia suspects that a gymnast is seen defying gravity as she performs an impressive move.
Hypothesis: Olivia suspects that the gymnast is a woman.
Reasoning: **The premise uses the pronoun "she," which directly and unambiguously indicates the gymnast is female. This is not a new detail but a fact stated in the premise.**
Answer: entailment

**Example 3 (Non-Entailment - Weak Nested Attitude):**
Premise: Charles suspects that Taylor thinks that two guys are on a couch.
Hypothesis: Charles suspects that two guys are on a couch.
Reasoning: **Iterated attitude with a weak primary verb ('suspects') and a non-factive embedded verb ('thinks'). Charles's suspicion about Taylor's belief does not mean Charles himself holds that belief.**
Answer: non-entailment

**Example 4 (Entailment - Weak Verb with Factive Embedding):**
Premise: Michael suspects that Charles learns that eight tourists stand at a railing.
Hypothesis: Michael suspects that eight tourists stand at a railing.
Reasoning: **The main verb is weak ('suspects'), BUT the embedded verb is factive ('learns'). To suspect that someone *learned* P logically requires suspecting that P is true. The factivity bleeds up.**
Answer: entailment

**Example 5 (Entailment - Weak Verb with Factive Embedding):**
Premise: Ava suspects that Charlotte sees that one man looks out.
Hypothesis: Ava suspects that one man looks out.
Reasoning: **The main verb is weak ('suspects'), BUT the embedded verb is factive ('sees', perceptual). To suspect that someone *saw* P logically requires suspecting that P is true.**
Answer: entailment

**Example 6 (Non-Entailment - Changed Subject):**
Premise: Charlotte assumes that Michael assumes that the guitarist performs a solo.
Hypothesis: Michael assumes that the guitarist performs a solo.
Reasoning: **The premise is about Charlotte's assumption. The hypothesis claims Michael's assumption is a fact. The subject changes from Charlotte to Michael.**
Answer: non-entailment

**Example 7 (Non-Entailment - No Commonsense Link):**
Premise: Maria believes that a man is eating an apple in the park.
Hypothesis: Maria believes that a man is eating fruit near a river.
Reasoning: **While "apple" is a fruit, "park" does not strongly imply "near a river." These are distinct locations without a necessary connection.**
Answer: non-entailment

**Now, apply this reasoning:**

Premise: {premise}
Hypothesis: {hypothesis}
Options: entailment, non-entailment

Think step by step. **First, identify S1 and Verb1. Then, check the embedded proposition for factive verbs (Verb2). Apply the rules for iterated attitudes, especially the exception for weak Verb1 + factive Verb2.** Then output your final answer as <answer>entailment</answer> or <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis. Follow these steps:

1.  **Decompose** both statements. Identify all agents and the exact propositions attributed to them at each level. Note the specific verbs used (e.g., *knows, believes, sees, remembers*).

2.  **Compare meticulously.**
    *   **Agent Check:** The outermost agent must be the same for entailment to be possible. If the agent changes, entailment is broken.
    *   **Factive Verb Rule:** A **factive** verb (e.g., *knows, realizes, sees, remembers*) means its embedded proposition is **true**. A **non-factive** verb (e.g., *believes, suspects, thinks*) does not confirm the truth of its embedded proposition.

3.  **Apply the Critical Entailment Rule for Beliefs:**
    *   If the premise states that **Agent A believes** that **Agent B VERB [that P]**, then:
        *   If VERB is **factive**, then `A believes that B VERB [that P]` **entails** `A believes that P`. This is because A cannot consistently believe B's factive attitude about P without themselves believing P to be true.
        *   If VERB is **non-factive**, then `A believes that B VERB [that P]` **does NOT entail** `A believes that P`. A can believe that B holds a belief without sharing that belief.
    *   This rule also applies if the embedded factive verb is attributed to the same agent (e.g., "A knows that P" entails "A believes that P").

4.  **Check for Semantic Equivalence:** For the embedded proposition P, or if dealing with a simple belief, the hypothesis must be a logical consequence of the premise. Use commonsense reasoning:
    *   "reading a book" entails "reading".
    *   "sitting on a bench by the sea" entails "near the ocean".
    *   Do not require exact word-for-word matching. Allow for paraphrases and inferences that are unambiguous given world knowledge.

5.  **Final Judgment:** Conclude "entailment" **only if** the premise directly and logically makes the hypothesis true after applying the rules above. If any genuine doubt exists, the answer is "non-entailment."

Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis. Follow these steps:

1.  **Decompose the statements.** Identify all agents and the exact propositions attributed to them at each level. Note the specific verbs used (e.g., *knows, sees, learns, believes, thinks*).

2.  **Analyze verb factivity for all embedded clauses:**
    *   A **factive verb** (e.g., *knows, realizes, sees, learns, understands, remembers*) means its embedded proposition is **true**.
    *   A **non-factive verb** (e.g., *believes, suspects, thinks, assumes*) means its embedded proposition is **not confirmed as true**; it only represents a belief.

3.  **Apply the Critical Belief Embedding Rule:**
    *   If the premise states that **Agent A believes a factive statement** (e.g., "Agent B **knows/sees/learns/understands** that P"), then this **entails** that Agent A believes the embedded proposition P. *Reasoning: To believe someone knows a fact is to believe the fact itself.*
    *   If the premise states that **Agent A believes a non-factive statement** (e.g., "Agent B **believes/thinks/suspects** that P"), then this **does not entail** that Agent A believes P. *Reasoning: Agent A can believe Agent B holds a belief without sharing it.*
    *   **Agent-specificity rule:** If the top-level agent in the premise and hypothesis are different, entailment is broken.

4.  **Compare the core propositions.** For entailment, the proposition that the top-level agent believes in the hypothesis must be logically equivalent to or a necessary consequence of the proposition embedded in the premise. Allow for minor, reasonable contextual inferences (e.g., "on a bench in the sun" on a beach implies "near the ocean").

*Reasoning: Main agent (Charlie) is identical. However, "thinks" is non-factive, so Rule 4 does not apply. "Writing with a pen" functionally entails "producing text", but this entailment is trapped inside David's non-factive belief. Charlie believes David has that belief, but this does not entail that Charlie shares the belief about producing text.*

Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis. Follow these steps:

1.  **Decompose the statements.** Identify all agents and the exact propositions attributed to them at each level. Note the specific verbs used (e.g., *knows, sees, learns, believes, thinks*).

2.  **Analyze verb factivity:**
    *   A **factive verb** (e.g., *knows, realizes, sees, learns, understands, remembers, recognizes*) means its embedded proposition is **true**.
    *   A **non-factive verb** (e.g., *believes, suspects, thinks, assumes*) means its embedded proposition is **not confirmed as true**; it only represents a belief.

3.  **Apply the Critical Belief Embedding Rules:**
    *   **Outer Verb Containment Principle:** The factivity of the **outermost verb** determines whether the entire embedded proposition can be treated as true in reality. A non-factive outer verb means that even factive embedded statements cannot be assumed to be true in reality.
    *   **Agent Transfer Prohibition:** If the top-level agent in the premise and hypothesis are different, entailment is immediately broken. The premise only provides information about its stated agent.
    *   **Recursive Factive Belief Entailment:** If the premise states that **Agent A believes a statement that contains a factive verb** (e.g., "Agent B **knows** that P" or "Agent C **sees** that Agent D **realizes** that P"), then you must unpack it. **A belief in a factive statement is a belief in the truth of its embedded proposition.** Therefore, "A believes [B knows P]" entails "A believes P". **Apply this rule recursively through any number of nested factive verbs.**
    *   **Non-Factive Belief Block:** If the premise states that **Agent A believes a non-factive statement** (e.g., "Agent B **believes/thinks/suspects** that P"), then this **does not entail** that Agent A believes P. *Reasoning: Agent A can believe Agent B holds a belief without sharing it. This block does not apply if the embedded non-factive statement contains a factive claim; use the Recursive Factive rule first.*

4.  **Compare the core propositions.** For entailment, the proposition that the top-level agent is committed to in the hypothesis must be logically equivalent to or a **necessary logical consequence** of the proposition the agent is committed to in the premise.
    *   **Generalization is Key:** A specific description entails a more general one. For example, "a boy in a green shirt" entails "a boy"; "a dog is running" entails "an animal is moving". **Do not get stuck on irrelevant details; identify the core fact being expressed. If the premise describes a complex scene, it entails the existence of its main components.**
    *   For **factive statements**, allow minor syntactic variations (reordering of clauses, passive/active voice) that preserve the same factual content.
    *   For **non-factive statements**, do not make **contextual or causal inferences** about the embedded content (e.g., "exits a pool" does not entail "was swimming"), as its truth is not established.

5.  **Final Judgment:** Conclude "entailment" **only if** the premise, under the rules above, logically ensures the hypothesis is true. If any doubt remains, the answer is "non-entailment."

After your reasoning, provide your final answer within <answer> tags.

**Examples:**
Premise: William assumes that Emma sees that a dog is running.
Hypothesis: Emma sees that a dog is running.

Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis. Follow these steps:

1.  **Decompose** both statements. Identify all agents and the exact propositions attributed to them at each level. Note the specific verbs used (e.g., *knows, believes, sees, remembers*) and classify each as **factive** or **non-factive**.

2.  **Interpret Propositions with Commonsense:** Read the propositions not just as text, but as descriptions of real-world scenarios. What does the action typically imply? What is the most likely context? Use this interpreted meaning for all subsequent comparisons. **Avoid hyper-literalism.**

3.  **Compare meticulously.**
    *   **Agent Invariant:** The outermost agent must be the same for entailment to be possible. If the agent changes, entailment is broken. **Stop reasoning.**
    *   **Factive Verb Rule:** A **factive** verb (e.g., *knows, realizes, sees, remembers, recognizes*) means its embedded proposition is **true**. A **non-factive** verb (e.g., *believes, suspects, thinks, assumes*) does not confirm the truth of its embedded proposition.

4.  **Apply the Critical Entailment Rule for Beliefs:**
    *   If the premise states that **Agent A believes** that **Agent B VERB [that P]**, then:
        *   If VERB is **factive**, then `A believes that B VERB [that P]` **entails** `A believes that P`. This is because A cannot consistently believe B's factive attitude about P without themselves believing P to be true.
        *   If VERB is **non-factive**, then `A believes that B VERB [that P]` **does NOT entail** `A believes that P`. A can believe that B holds a belief without sharing that belief.
    *   This rule also applies if the embedded factive verb is attributed to the same agent (e.g., "A knows that P" entails "A believes that P").

5.  **Non-Factive Barrier Rule:** If the premise uses a non-factive verb, you **cannot** conclude that its embedded proposition is true or that the agent within it actually holds the stated belief.

6.  **Check for Semantic Equivalence and Commonsense Entailment:** For the embedded proposition P, or if dealing with a simple belief, the hypothesis must be a logical consequence of the premise.
    *   **If the verbs are factive:** You are comparing the *truth* of the propositions. Does the truth of the premise's proposition **make it necessarily true, or at least highly likely based on common world knowledge,** that the hypothesis's proposition is true?
    *   **If the verbs are non-factive:** You are comparing the *beliefs* of the agent. If Agent A believes a proposition X, then they also believe all **necessary and unambiguous components** of X. **Use world knowledge to determine what is a necessary part of the believed scenario.**
    *   **Allow for pragmatic inferences:** For example, "sweeping" commonsensically entails "sweeping dirt/debris"; "a person surrounded by toys" in a context with children implies "a classroom or playroom".

7.  **Final Judgment:** Conclude "entailment" **only if** the premise directly and logically makes the hypothesis true after applying the rules above. **If the connection requires a small, commonsense inference and there is no genuine ambiguity, the answer is "entailment".** If any genuine doubt exists, or the inference is large or speculative, the answer is "non-entailment."

**Failure Analysis Examples (Learn From These):**
Premise: William believes that the man is sweeping with a red broom.
Hypothesis: William believes that the man is sweeping dirt.
<reasoning> Same agent (William). Verb is non-factive ("believes"). We are comparing William's beliefs. The core action in the premise is "sweeping". Based on commonsense world knowledge, the purpose of sweeping is to move dirt/debris. Believing the action is occurring entails believing its typical goal is being pursued. The color of the broom is a separate, irrelevant detail. Therefore, William's belief entails the belief that the man is sweeping dirt. </reasoning>

Premise: Thomas recognizes that a boy in a green shirt is surrounded by toys and another boy, wearing a blue shirt with penguins, is to his left.
Hypothesis: Thomas recognizes that two boys sit in a classroom at their desks.
<reasoning> Same agent (Thomas). Verb is factive ("recognizes"), so the embedded proposition is true. The premise describes two boys in a context with toys. The hypothesis specifies a classroom setting. Based on commonsense, a scene with multiple children and toys is highly typical of a kindergarten or preschool classroom. "To his left" strongly implies they are seated. Therefore, the truth of the premise's proposition makes it highly likely that the hypothesis's proposition is true. The inference is small and unambiguous. </reasoning>

Determine whether the Premise entails the Hypothesis. Follow these rules strictly:

1.  **Strict Textual Reasoning:** Base your judgment solely on the information provided in the Premise and the definitions of the words used. Do not use external world knowledge or invent scenarios where a person might be mistaken or lying. The only facts are those stated or logically implied by the words in the Premise.
2.  **Mental State Verb Interpretation:** 
    - **Belief-Entailing Verbs:** Verbs such as `knows`, `understands`, `sees` (in a perceptual/cognitive sense), `is aware`, and `realizes` **entail belief** in their complement. If Person B `knows P`, then B `believes P`.
    - **Non-Belief-Entailing Verbs:** Verbs like `suspects`, `thinks it is possible`, `wonders if`, and `doubts` do **not** entail firm belief in their complement.
3.  **Belief Propagation Principle:** If Person A believes that Person B holds a mental state that entails belief in proposition P, then Person A also believes P.
    - For example: "A believes that B **knows** P" → B's knowing entails B's believing → Therefore, A believes that B believes P → Therefore, A believes P.
4.  **Entailment Definition:** Entailment occurs only if the Hypothesis must logically be true when the Premise is true, based on the rules above.

**Examples for Guidance:**

- **Example 1 (Entailment):**
  Premise: John believes that Mary **knows** the restaurant is closed.
  Hypothesis: John believes the restaurant is closed.
  Reasoning: "Knows" entails belief. The Premise states John believes that Mary holds a belief (that the restaurant is closed). Therefore, John himself believes that the restaurant is closed.
  Answer: entailment

- **Example 2 (Non-Entailment):**
  Premise: Sarah thinks it's possible that it will rain.
  Hypothesis: Sarah believes it will rain.
  Reasoning: "Thinks it's possible" expresses uncertainty and does not entail a firm belief. The Hypothesis requires firm belief, which does not follow from the Premise.
  Answer: non-entailment

- **Example 3 (Entailment - Corrects Common Failure):**
  Premise: Isabella thinks that Amelia **understands** that men play hockey.
  Hypothesis: Isabella thinks that men play hockey.
  Reasoning: "Understands" is a belief-entailing verb (if one understands P, one believes P). The Premise means Isabella believes that Amelia believes men play hockey. Therefore, by the Belief Propagation Principle, Isabella believes that men play hockey.

**Title:** Expert SVG Path Shape Analysis

**Task:**
You are a computational geometry specialist. Analyze SVG path strings to identify the precise geometric shape drawn, selecting from provided options. Your analysis must be technically rigorous, focusing on the net geometric result rather than command sequence patterns.

**Instructions:**
1. **Path Deconstruction:** Parse all commands (M, L, A, Q, C, Z, etc.) and their parameters
2. **Geometric Interpretation:** Calculate the complete path trajectory. Determine:
   - Start/end points and closure status
   - Presence of straight lines vs. curves
   - Symmetry properties and center points
   - Actual shape formed by the complete path

3. **Critical Shape Definitions:**
   - **Circle:** Closed curve with constant radius from center. May use multiple arcs with rx=ry
   - **Sector:** MUST have two straight radii (L commands) connecting arc endpoints to center
   - **Ellipse:** Closed curve with rx≠ry
   - **Polygons:** Exclusively straight line segments (L commands)
   - **Line:** Single segment without closure

4. **Key Analytical Principles:**
   - Two identical arcs returning to start form a circle, not a sector
   - Count actual drawn elements, not just commands
   - Verify if straight lines are present (sector requires them)
   - Consider the complete path effect, not individual commands

5. **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
   - ≠ "Two arcs" ≠ "Sector" (sectors require straight lines)
   - ≠ "Closed path with curves" ≠ "Circle" (must have constant radius)
   - ≠ "Multiple segments" ≠ "Polygon" (must be straight lines only)

**Examples for Reference:**

**Incorrect Analysis Example:**
Path: M 94.11,35.73 A 31.40,31.40 344.31 1,0 33.65,52.71 A 31.40,31.40 344.31 1,0 94.11,35.73
Mistake: Assuming "two arcs" creates a sector
Correct: Two identical arcs form full circle (no straight lines present)

**Correct Analysis Example:**
Path: M 100,100 L 140,100 A 40,40 0 0,1 100,100 Z
Correct: Single arc with straight line to center creates actual sector

6. **Output Format:**
   - Provide concise technical reasoning
   - Reference specific path commands and their geometric meaning
   - Compare to shape definitions

Name the geometric shape drawn by an SVG path by counting its unique vertices. Follow these steps:

1. Extract all coordinate points from the path commands (M and L).
2. Remove duplicate points (identical coordinates) to get the list of unique vertices.
3. Count the number of unique vertices.
4. Map the count to the shape name:
   - 3: triangle
   - 4: quadrilateral (check options for specifics like rectangle/kite)
   - 5: pentagon
   - 6: hexagon
   - 7: heptagon
   - 8: octagon
   - etc.

Important: The final command (L to start or Z) does not add a new vertex. If the path ends by returning to the start, that point is a duplicate and should not be counted again.

Examples for clarity:
- Path: <path d="M 10,10 L 20,10 L 20,20 L 10,20 Z"/> → Points: (10,10), (20,10), (20,20), (10,20) → 4 unique → quadrilateral.
- Path: <path d="M 0,0 L 5,0 L 5,5 L 0,5 L 0,0"/> → Points: (0,0), (5,0), (5,5), (0,5) → (0,0) is duplicate → 4 unique → quadrilateral.

Now, analyze the given path and choose from the options.

You are an expert at analyzing SVG paths and identifying the most fundamental geometric shape they represent. Follow these steps precisely for accurate results:

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Instructions:**
1.  Parse the path data. Identify all commands (M, L, A, Z, etc.).
2.  Check if the path is closed. It is closed if it ends with 'Z' or if the final endpoint is exactly equal to the starting point (from the M command).
3.  For Arc (A) commands:
    a. Note the x-radius (rx) and y-radius (ry). If rx and ry are equal, the arc is circular.
    b. Analyze the flags (large-arc-flag, sweep-flag) and endpoints to determine the sweep angle of each arc.
    c. **Crucial Rule:** Calculate the *total* angular sweep of all arcs in the path. If the path is closed and the combined arcs form a full 360-degree circle, the shape is a "circle". A sector is only correct if the path does **not** form a full circle.
4.  The goal is to select the most basic, primitive shape from the options. A circle is more fundamental than a sector. A square is a type of rectangle, so "rectangle" is the fundamental choice if both are options.
5.  Finally, output your answer in the format: `<answer>shape_name</answer>`

**Example of a Common Mistake to Avoid:**
- **Incorrect Analysis:** A path with two large-arc flags that form a full 360-degree circle might be mistaken for a sector.
- **Correct Analysis:** Two arcs with equal radii that start and end at the same point, forming a closed loop of 360 degrees, define a circle.

**Question to analyze:**
```xml
<path d="M 18.32,43.48 A 12.66,12.66 94.39 1,0 20.26,18.23 A 12.66,12.66 94.39 1,0 18.32,43.48"/>
```
**Reasoning:**
1.  The path starts at (18.32,43.48) and ends at the same point; it is closed.
2.  Both arcs have equal radii (12.66, 12.66), so they are circular.
3.  The two large-arc (flag=1) arcs combine to form a complete 360-degree circle.
4.  Therefore, the most fundamental shape is a circle, not a sector.
**Correct Answer:** `<answer>circle</answer>`

Now, apply this rigorous reasoning to the following question.

Name the geometric shape drawn by an SVG path by analyzing its commands and unique vertices. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Check for Curved Commands:** First, examine the path for any non-linear commands: 
   - `A` (arc)
   - `C`, `S` (cubic Bézier)
   - `Q`, `T` (quadratic Bézier)
   
   **If any curved commands are present:**
   - Analyze the command sequence to identify special shapes:
     - A path ending with `Z` that contains one `A` command and two `L` commands likely forms a **sector**.
     - Two `A` commands forming a full loop indicates a **circle** or **ellipse**.
   - If the shape matches a specific curved option (e.g., sector, circle), output that directly.
   - If no curved commands are found, proceed to Step 2.

2. **For Polygons (Only M/L Commands):**
   - Extract all points from `M` and `L` commands.
   - Remove duplicate points (identical coordinates) to find unique vertices.
   - Count the unique vertices (`n`).
   - Map the count to the shape:
     - 1-2: Invalid polygon (output "line" if exactly two points)
     - 3: triangle
     - 4: quadrilateral (default; if options include specifics like "rectangle" or "kite", note that additional analysis may be needed)
     - 5: pentagon
     - 6: hexagon
     - 7: heptagon
     - 8: octagon
     - >8: polygon with [n] sides

3. **Special Cases:**
   - The `Z` command closes the path to the start point—this does not add a new vertex.
   - An explicit `L` to the start point is a duplicate and should not be counted again.

**Examples for Guidance:**
- **Curved Example:**  
  Path: `<path d="M 18.51,5.48 L 34.19,27.80 A 27.27,27.27 243.03 0,1 8.20,30.73 L 18.51,5.48"/>`  
  → Contains an arc (`A`). The structure is: line → arc → line back to start.  
  → This is a **sector**, not a triangle.

- **Polygon Example:**  
  Path: `<path d="M 10,10 L 20,10 L 20,20 L 10,20 Z"/>`  
  → No curves. Points: (10,10), (20,10), (20,20), (10,20) → 4 unique → **quadrilateral**.

- **Duplicate Handling:**  
  Path: `<path d="M 0,0 L 5,0 L 5,5 L 0,5 L 0,0"/>`  
  → No curves. Points: (0,0), (5,0), (5,5), (0,5) → (0,0) is duplicate → 4 unique → **quadrilateral**.

Now, analyze the given path and choose from the options. Pay close attention to the presence of arcs or Bézier curves, which indicate non-polygonal shapes.

Determine whether the Premise entails the Hypothesis. Follow these rules strictly:

1.  **Strict Textual Reasoning:** Base your judgment solely on the information provided in the Premise and the definitions of the words used. Do not use external world knowledge or invent scenarios where a person might be mistaken or lying. The only facts are those stated or logically implied by the words in the Premise.
2.  **Generalized Mental State Propagation:** The following principles apply to all propositional attitudes (e.g., believes, assumes, suspects, knows). If Person A holds an attitude M toward the proposition that Person B holds a stronger attitude N toward proposition P, then Person A also holds attitude M toward P. The attitude (M) remains consistent through the propagation.
3.  **Strength of Mental State Verbs:**
    - **Strongly Entailing Verbs:** Verbs such as `knows`, `understands`, `is aware`, `realizes`, and `sees` (in a perceptual/cognitive sense) **entail firm belief** in their complement. If Person B `knows P`, then B `believes P`.
    - **Weakly Entailing or Non-Entailing Verbs:** Verbs like `suspects`, `thinks it is possible`, `wonders if`, `doubts`, and `assumes` do **not** by themselves entail firm belief in their complement.
4.  **Mental State Propagation Principle:** If Person A holds mental state M (e.g., believes, assumes, suspects) that Person B holds a mental state N that entails belief in proposition P, then Person A also holds mental state M toward P.
5.  **Entailment Definition:** Entailment occurs only if the Hypothesis must logically be true when the Premise is true, based on the rules above.

**Examples for Guidance:**

- **Example 1 (Entailment):**
  Premise: John believes that Mary **knows** the restaurant is closed.
  Hypothesis: John believes the restaurant is closed.
  Reasoning: "Knows" entails belief. The Premise states John believes that Mary holds a belief. Therefore, John himself believes that the restaurant is closed.
  Answer: entailment

- **Example 2 (Non-Entailment):**
  Premise: Sarah thinks it's possible that it will rain.
  Hypothesis: Sarah believes it will rain.
  Reasoning: "Thinks it's possible" expresses uncertainty and does not entail a firm belief. The Hypothesis requires firm belief, which does not follow from the Premise.
  Answer: non-entailment

- **Example 3 (Entailment):**
  Premise: Isabella thinks that Amelia **understands** that men play hockey.
  Hypothesis: Isabella thinks that men play hockey.
  Reasoning: "Understands" is a strongly belief-entailing verb. The Premise means Isabella believes that Amelia believes men play hockey. Therefore, by the Propagation Principle, Isabella believes that men play hockey.
  Answer: entailment

- **Example 4 (Entailment):**
  Premise: Thomas suspects that Emma **sees** that a woman is playing the drums.
  Hypothesis: Thomas suspects that a woman is playing the drums.
  Reasoning: "Sees" is a strongly belief-entailing verb. The Premise means Thomas suspects that Emma believes a woman is playing the drums. Thomas's suspicion about Emma's belief implies Thomas holds the same suspicion about the proposition itself.
  Answer: entailment

- **Example 5 (Non-Entailment):**
  Premise: Olivia believes that Noah **suspects** a crime occurred.
  Hypothesis: Olivia believes a crime occurred.
  Reasoning: "Suspects" is not a belief-entailing verb. The Premise states that Olivia believes Noah has a suspicion. This does not mean Olivia shares that belief.
  Answer: non-entailment

- **Example 6 (Entailment - Corrects Past Failure):**
  Premise: Joseph assumes that Amelia **understands** that three military officials are battling a fire.
  Hypothesis: Joseph assumes that three military officials are battling a fire.
  Reasoning: "Understands" is a strongly belief-entailing verb. The Premise states Joseph *assumes* that Amelia holds a belief. According to the Generalized Propagation rule, Joseph's *assumption* about Amelia's belief means Joseph himself *assumes* the proposition to be true.
  Answer: entailment

Now, analyze the new input:
Premise: {premise}
Hypothesis: {hypothesis}
Options:
- entailment
- non-entailment

Reasoning: [Apply the rules step-by-step. First, identify the main mental state verb held by the subject and classify it. Then, identify any embedded mental state verbs and classify their strength.

Determine whether the Premise entails the Hypothesis by following a structured reasoning process. Base your analysis solely on the information provided in the Premise. Entailment holds only if the truth of the Premise guarantees the truth of the Hypothesis.

**Key Principles:**
1.  **Strict Containment:** Do not introduce external information. The analysis must be derived logically from the given text.
2.  **Factive Verbs:** Verbs like "knows," "learns," "sees," "realizes," "discovers," and "recognizes" are **factive**. They presuppose the truth of their embedded clause (e.g., "knows that P" implies P is true).
3.  **Main Attitude Holder's Perspective:** Analyze the entire scenario from the perspective of the subject of the main verb in the Premise (e.g., the one who "suspects" or "assumes"). The content of their attitude defines the world for evaluating entailment.
4.  **Logical Simplification within Attitude:** A complex proposition embedded under a factive verb can be simplified. For example, from the main attitude holder's perspective, "X knows that P" logically implies "P". Therefore, if the main holder has an attitude toward the complex proposition, they also have that same attitude toward its simplified, factual components.

**Reasoning Steps:**
1.  **Identify the main attitude holder:** Who is the subject of the primary verb (e.g., suspects, assumes) in the Premise?
2.  **Identify the full proposition:** What is the complete "that-clause" that the main attitude holder is considering?
3.  **Analyze and simplify embedded clauses:**
    - Locate any factive verbs within the proposition.
    - For each factive verb, treat its embedded clause as a **true fact** from the perspective of its subject.
    - **Crucially, simplify:** The proposition "X VERBfact that P" logically implies "P". Therefore, the main attitude holder's stance toward the complex proposition also applies to the simpler fact P.
4.  **Check for entailment:**
    - Compare the simplified proposition from the Premise to the Hypothesis.
    - If the Hypothesis is a logical consequence of this simplified proposition, entailment holds.
    - **Exception for Negative Attitudes:** If the main verb is negative (e.g., *doubts, denies*), entailment typically does **not** hold, as these attitudes block the upward propagation of truth.
5.  **Conclude** based on whether the Premise, after logical simplification, guarantees the Hypothesis.

**Examples for Guidance:**

**Example 1 (Entailment: Suspicion + Knowledge):**
Premise: Richard suspects that Amelia knows that the wind propels a sailing ship.
Hypothesis: Richard suspects that the wind propels a sailing ship.
Reasoning:
- Main attitude holder: **Richard**
- Full proposition: "that Amelia knows that the wind propels a sailing ship"
- Simplification: "Knows" is factive. "Amelia knows that P" **implies P**. Therefore, Richard's suspicion of the complex proposition inherently includes suspicion of the simpler fact P.
- Entailment holds.
Answer: <answer>entailment</answer>

**Example 2 (Entailment: Assumption + Seeing):**
Premise: Richard assumes that Charles sees that two individuals use a photo kiosk.
Hypothesis: Richard assumes that two individuals use a photo kiosk.
Reasoning:
- Main attitude holder: **Richard**
- Full proposition: "that Charles sees that two individuals use a photo kiosk"
- Simplification: "Sees that" is factive. "Charles sees that P" **implies P**. Richard's assumption of the complex proposition entails his assumption of P.
- Entailment holds.
Answer: <answer>entailment</answer>

**Example 3 (Non-Entailment: Doubt):**
Premise: Sarah doubts that Emma realizes that the door is locked.
Hypothesis: Sarah doubts that the door is locked.
Reasoning:
- Main attitude holder: **Sarah**
- Full proposition: "that Emma realizes that the door is locked"
- Analysis: Although "realizes" is factive, Sarah **doubts** the entire proposition. Her doubt does not commit her to a belief about the locked door; she may believe it is unlocked.
- Entailment does not hold.
Answer: <answer>non-entailment</answer>

**Example 4 (Non-Entailment: Added Information):**
Premise: Thomas recognizes a scene with two boys described by their clothing and position.
Hypothesis: Thomas recognizes that two boys sit in a classroom at their desks.
Reasoning:

Determine whether the Premise entails the Hypothesis by following these reasoning steps. Pay special attention to statements involving nested beliefs or mental states to avoid logical fallacies.

**Reasoning Steps:**
1. **Identify Context and Scope:** Identify all mental state verbs (e.g., believes, knows, thinks, assumes). Determine whether the Hypothesis makes a claim that is fully contained within the same scope as the Premise’s mental state verbs.
   - **Critical Rule: Do not export beliefs.** If the Premise attributes a belief to someone (e.g., “A thinks that B thinks X”), this does **not** entail that B actually holds that belief (e.g., “B thinks X”). The Premise only informs what A believes about B.

2. **Check for Exact Match within Scope:** If the Hypothesis appears verbatim or synonymously within the same mental state scope in the Premise, then entailment holds.
   - Example: Premise: “Ava thinks that Thomas thinks X” entails Hypothesis: “Ava thinks that Thomas thinks X.”

3. **Check Lexical Meaning (Within Scope):** Does the Premise imply the Hypothesis through word meanings, but only within the same belief scope? (e.g., “dog” → “animal” inside a “thinks that” clause).

4. **Apply Commonsense (Within Scope):** Use commonsense inference only within the same belief scope. For example, “sweeping with a broom” implies “sweeping dirt,” but only if both are within the same mental state context.

5. **Decide:** The Hypothesis is entailed **only if** it must be true in every possible scenario where the Premise is true. If the Hypothesis refers to a fact or belief outside the scope of the Premise’s mental states, it is **not entailed**.

**Examples:**
- Premise: William believes that the man is sweeping with a red broom.  
  Hypothesis: William believes that the man is sweeping dirt.  
  Reasoning: Within William’s belief, sweeping with a broom implies sweeping dirt.  
  Answer: entailment

- Premise: Ava thinks that Thomas thinks that the player is avoiding a tackle.  
  Hypothesis: Thomas thinks that the player is avoiding a tackle.  
  Reasoning: The Hypothesis exports Thomas’s belief outside the scope of Ava’s belief. This is invalid.  
  Answer: non-entailment

- Premise: Sophia assumes that Richard thinks that multiple men are in the scene.  
  Hypothesis: Sophia assumes that multiple men are in the scene.  
  Reasoning: The Hypothesis is not exported; it stays within Sophia’s assumption.  
  Answer: entailment

Determine whether the Premise entails the Hypothesis by following these reasoning steps. For statements about beliefs, knowledge, or thoughts, evaluate entailment from the perspective of the person holding that belief, using commonsense inferences about typical goals and relationships.

**Reasoning Steps:**
1.  **Identify Context and Scope:** Identify all mental states (e.g., believes, knows, thinks, assumes). Note who holds each belief and any nesting (e.g., "A believes that B believes..."). **Crucially, the entailment must be evaluated at the same level of belief attribution. A premise about a person's belief does not entail the factual truth of that belief's content, nor does it entail that a nested belief is actually held by the nested agent.**
2.  **Check Lexical Meaning:** Does the Premise directly imply the Hypothesis through word meanings (e.g., "dog" → "animal")?
3.  **Apply Commonsense:** Would a reasonable person infer the Hypothesis from the Premise based on typical scenarios (e.g., "sweeping with a broom" usually implies "sweeping dirt")? **This applies to inferences *within* the content of a single belief.**
4.  **Analyze Belief Structure (Key for Nesting):**
    *   **Distinguish content from attitude:** Separate what is believed (the content) from the fact that it is believed (the attitude).
    *   **For nested beliefs (e.g., "A believes that B believes X"):** The premise is a claim about A's mental state. It does not entail "B believes X" because A could be mistaken. The hypothesis is only entailed if it is a direct match to the *content* of a belief described in the premise, from the perspective of the belief holder.
5.  **Avoid Over-Literalism:** Do not require explicit mention; plausible inference is sufficient for entailment **within the content of a belief**. However, **be strict and literal with the structure of belief attribution.** The fact that a belief is described does not make its content true in the world.
6.  **Decide:** If the Hypothesis **must be true** (i.e., it is a necessary consequence **with no room for the belief holder to be mistaken**) given the Premise (via direct meaning or commonsense **within the correct scope**), answer entailment; otherwise, non-entailment.

**Examples:**
- Premise: William believes that the man is sweeping with a red broom.
  Hypothesis: William believes that the man is sweeping dirt.
  Reasoning: From William's perspective, sweeping with a broom commonsensically implies sweeping dirt. This is an inference within the content of his belief.
  Answer: entailment

- Premise: Sarah thinks the vase is red.
  Hypothesis: Sarah thinks the vase is blue.
  Reasoning: Red and blue are distinct colors; one does not imply the other within the content of her belief.
  Answer: non-entailment

- **Premise: Charles assumes that Abigail assumes that a woman walks down the street.**
  **Hypothesis: Abigail assumes that a woman walks down the street.**
  **Reasoning: The premise describes Charles's assumption *about* Abigail's mental state. The hypothesis claims Abigail *actually* holds that assumption. Charles could be wrong; his assumption does not force Abigail's mental state to match.**
  **Answer: non-entailment**

- **Premise: Anna knows that Bob thinks the car is blue.**
  **Hypothesis: Bob thinks the car is blue.**
  **Reasoning: The premise is a claim about Anna's knowledge. The hypothesis is a claim about Bob's thoughts. Anna's knowledge does not determine Bob's actual thoughts; she might be incorrect.**

Determine whether the Premise entails the Hypothesis by following these reasoning steps. For statements about beliefs, knowledge, or thoughts, evaluate entailment strictly from the perspective of the person holding that belief, focusing on the content of their mental state.

**Reasoning Steps:**
1.  **Identify Context & Nesting:** Identify if the Premise describes an objective fact or a mental state (e.g., believes, knows, thinks). If it is a mental state, note the primary subject (e.g., "William") and the exact content of their belief. **If the belief is about another belief (e.g., "A assumes that B suspects X"), the content is the entire clause "that B suspects X". Do not infer that the subject (A) believes the embedded proposition (X) is true.**
2.  **Check Lexical Meaning:** Does the Premise directly imply the Hypothesis through word meanings or synonyms (e.g., "canine" → "dog")?
3.  **Apply Commonsense:** For objective events within a belief, use typical world knowledge (e.g., "sweeping with a broom" implies "sweeping dirt"). **For mental states, adhere to these strict rules:**
    *   **A believes X** does not entail **X is true**.
    *   **A believes that B believes X** entails **A believes that B believes X**. It does not entail **A believes X**, **B believes X**, or **X is true**.
4.  **Avoid Invalid Inferences:** Be literal with belief boundaries. Plausible inferences are only valid for events and goals *within* the same belief context. Never infer the truth of a belief's content from the fact that it is believed.
5.  **Decide:** If the Hypothesis must be true given the Premise's content (via direct meaning or valid commonsense within the belief's scope), answer entailment; otherwise, non-entailment.

**Examples:**
- **Premise:** William believes that the man is sweeping with a red broom.
  **Hypothesis:** William believes that the man is sweeping dirt.
  **Reasoning:** From William's perspective, the action described ("sweeping with a broom") typically implies sweeping dirt. This is a valid commonsense inference about the event within his belief.
  **Answer:** entailment

- **Premise:** Sarah thinks the vase is red.
  **Hypothesis:** Sarah thinks the vase is blue.
  **Reasoning:** The colors red and blue are distinct and do not imply each other. The content of Sarah's belief does not entail the hypothesis.
  **Answer:** non-entailment

- **Premise:** William assumes that Abigail suspects that two scuba divers are inspecting a large metal object.
  **Hypothesis:** William assumes that two scuba divers are inspecting a large metal object.
  **Reasoning:** The premise's content is William's assumption "that Abigail suspects X". The hypothesis is William's assumption "that X is true". These are two different beliefs. Assuming someone else suspects something does not entail assuming that thing is true oneself.
  **Answer:** non-entailment

- **Premise:** Chloe knows that Mark thinks the meeting is canceled.
  **Hypothesis:** Chloe knows the meeting is canceled.
  **Reasoning:** The premise is about Chloe's knowledge of Mark's belief. The hypothesis is about Chloe's knowledge of the meeting's status. Chloe can know what Mark thinks without knowing that his thought is correct.
  **Answer:** non-entailment

**Now, analyze the following:**
Premise: [Premise]
Hypothesis: [Hypothesis]
Reasoning:
Answer:
he motor," so we test "if Ned *had* changed it").

4.  **Apply the Precise Difference-Making Test (Counterfactual):**
    *   For the event in question, ask: **"If this specific event had been different (e.g., if the agent had acted differently, or if the event had not occurred at all), would the effect still have occurred in the exact same way, and at the exact same time?"**
    *   This is the primary test.
    *   If **NO**, the event is a cause.
    *   If **YES**, proceed to step 5.

5.  **Overdetermination & Preemption Analysis:** If the effect would have occurred anyway at the same time:
    *   **Preemption:** Was the effect already guaranteed to occur at that time by a **pre-existing condition** or a **separate, sufficient causal process** that was already in motion? If yes, then the event in question is redundant and **not a cause** of the effect's occurrence at that time.
    *   **True (Symmetric) Overdetermination:** Did multiple sufficient causal events occur *simultaneously*, and was the effect **not** already guaranteed by a pre-existing condition? If yes, then **all are causes**.

6.  **Synthesize:** An event is a cause if it made a difference to the effect's occurrence or its timing. In symmetric overdetermination, all sufficient simultaneous factors are causes. Preempted or redundant actions are not.

**Key Principles:**
*   **The Counterfactual is King:** The difference-making test is the primary tool.
*   **Timing is Part of the Effect:** Causing an effect to happen at time T is different from causing it to happen at all.
*   **Pre-Existing Conditions Trump Actions:** An action is not a cause if it merely fails to alter a state that was already sufficient to bring about the effect.
*   **Simultaneity is Strict:** For overdetermination, all sufficient events must occur at the same time, and none can be preempted.

**Review these critical examples to avoid common errors:**

**Example A (Ned's Motorboat):**
*   **Effect:** Motorboat starts *when Ned turns the key*.
*   **Action Under Test:** Ned *not changing* the motor's position.
*   **Counterfactual:** If Ned *had changed* the motor's position (out of lock), the boat would *not* have started via the motor-in-lock pathway. The gear being in neutral is a pre-existing condition, but the effect's occurrence *when Ned turned the key* relied on him *preserving* the motor-in-lock condition. His inaction *made a difference*.
*   **Correct Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example B (Alex's Board Game):**
*   **Effect:** Alex wins *on his next turn*.
*   **Action Under Test:** Alex *spinning the spinner*.
*   **Counterfactual:** If Alex had *not spun* the spinner, he would still have won *on that turn* due to the simultaneous dice roll. The effect would have occurred at the same time.
*   **Analysis:** This is **symmetric overdetermination**. Both the dice roll and the spin were sufficient, dynamic events that occurred simultaneously. Neither was pre-existing. Therefore, **both are causes**.
*   **Correct Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example C (Climate Control System):**
*   **Effect:** System turns on *at 8:45 am*.
*   **Action Under Test:** Design studio employees *arriving at 8:45 am*.
*   **Counterfactual:** If the design studio employees had *not arrived at 8:45 am* (and arrived at 10 am as usual), the system would *still* have turned on *at 8:45 am* due to the travel agency's arrival.
*   **Analysis:** The travel agency's arrival was a sufficient, dynamic event that preempted the design studio's arrival from being a cause of the *8:45 am* effect. The studio's arrival is redundant.
*   **Correct Answer:** <answer>No</answer>

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the scenario. Your goal is to determine if actor X is appropriately considered *a* cause of outcome Y, which involves both mechanistic dependence and pragmatic attribution. Follow these steps precisely:

**0. Frame the Question & Outcome:** First, determine if the question is primarily about mechanistic causation or about blame/credit/responsibility. The phrasing "did X cause Y" often implies the latter, especially when norms, roles, or expectations are present. Precisely define the outcome Y. Is it the general outcome or a specific instance of it (e.g., "death" vs. "death at this exact moment from this specific cause")? For attribution, the specific instance is often more relevant.

**1. Identify Key Elements:** Determine the outcome in question and the potential causes or actions being considered.

**2. Apply the Cautious Counterfactual Test:** For any potential cause, ask "If this specific event had not occurred, would the outcome still have happened *in the exact way it did*?"
    *   Construct counterfactuals using only information provided in the scenario. Avoid assuming events would have unfolded identically unless explicitly supported.
    *   For omissions (not doing X), the counterfactual is "if the actor *had* done X, would Y have been different?"
    *   If the outcome would **not** have occurred without it, then it is a necessary cause.
    *   If the outcome **would** have occurred without it, then it is not a necessary cause.
    *   **Important:** A finding of 'not necessary' is not a final answer. Proceed to evaluate sufficiency and pragmatic factors.

**3. Evaluate Causal Sufficiency & Redundancy:**
    *   Even if an event was not necessary, it can still be *a* cause if it was itself a sufficient condition for the outcome.
    *   **Preemption:** If a sufficient cause occurs first and actually brings about the outcome, later sufficient causes are preempted and are not considered causes *for that instance of the outcome*. The outcome is already settled.
    *   **Simultaneous Sufficiency (Overdetermination):** If two or more sufficient causes occur simultaneously (before the outcome is triggered), **all are considered causes.** The outcome is overdetermined.
    *   **Temporal Sequence Matters:** For outcomes like winning a bet, the event that **first satisfies the condition** is often the pragmatically attributed cause, even if later redundant events occur.

**4. Analyze Causal Proximity (for complex chains):**
    *   For long causal chains, identify the **proximate (direct, immediate)** cause of the outcome.
    *   Identify **distal (indirect, background)** causes.
    *   A **novel, intervening cause** (e.g., a freak accident, a major mistake by a third party) that occurs after a distal cause can **break the chain of attribution** for the distal cause, making the intervening cause the primary one for pragmatic attribution.

**5. Evaluate Normative Context:**
    *   A violation of a rule, policy, or standard expectation is a very strong cue for *attributing blame or primary responsibility*.
    *   **Crucially:** The *absence* of a normative violation does not erase causal contribution. An action can be morally permissible or even expected yet still be a necessary part of the causal chain. Use norms to assign primary responsibility, not to deny causation entirely.

**6. Analyze Intentionality Separately:** For questions about intent, if a harmful side-effect was foreseen with certainty and the actor proceeded regardless, then that side-effect is typically judged to have been brought about intentionally.

**7. Determine Pragmatic Attribution:**
    *   **Default vs. Deviant:** An event that is a **deviation** from the normal, expected, or default course of events is a stronger candidate for being labeled 'the cause' than an event that is part of the background.
    *   **Salience of Omissions:** An omission (not acting) can be salient if the actor **actively considered acting** and chose not to. Otherwise, it is usually part of the background and not attributed as a cause.
    *   The most **salient** or **abnormal** event is often singled out as the "cause."

**8. Synthesize Your Reasoning:** Weigh the results of the previous steps. For mechanistic questions, rely on counterfactuals and sufficiency. For attribution questions, you **must** integrate the results of Step 4 (Proximity) and Step 7 (Pragmatics) with the mechanistic analysis. A cause that is mechanically sufficient but deviant is often the answer. A distal cause is often overruled by a novel proximate cause.

**9. Output Your Final Answer:** Choose between the provided options (Yes/No), ensuring it aligns with the synthesized reasoning above.

**Review the following examples to understand common pitfalls and their corrections:**

**Example 1 (Omission & Pragmatic Salience):**
*   **Question:** Did Wayne not changing the position of the device cause it to be fully charged?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The device was plugged in, so it would have charged anyway. His inaction was not necessary, so it is not a cause. (This ignores that his conscious decision *not* to act after verifying the situation is a salient, intentional omission that pragmatically qualifies as a cause).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** While not mechanically necessary, Wayne's omission was a deliberate, salient action in the narrative. He checked and chose not to interfere. This makes it a pragmatically attributed cause of the charge remaining uninterrupted. Answer: Yes.

**Example 2 (Temporal Preemption & Winning Conditions):**
*   **Question:** Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The later 3-point shot was also sufficient and more dramatic, so the layup was not the cause. (This misapplies salience and ignores that the winning condition was fulfilled at the moment of the layup).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The layup was a sufficient cause that occurred first and actually satisfied the winning condition for the bet. The subsequent 3-pointer was redundant. The first sufficient cause to occur is the pragmatically attributed cause. Answer: Yes.

**Example 3 (Intervening Cause & Proximity):**
*   **Question:** Did John's job cause his premature death?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Without the job and the cancer, John wouldn't have been in the hospital for the fatal error, so the job caused his death. (This is a mechanistic view that ignores the novel, intervening proximate cause for attribution).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The job was a distal cause of his illness. The nurse's medication error was a novel, intervening proximate cause that directly led to his death at that specific moment. This breaks the chain of pragmatic attribution for the job. Answer: No.

**Example 4 (Simultaneous Overdetermination vs. Default/Deviant):**
*   **Question:** Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Both arrivals were sufficient and simultaneous, so both are causes. (This is a mechanistic view that ignores the pragmatic default/deviant distinction).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The travel agency's arrival was the normal, default, and expected sufficient cause for the system turning on at 8:45 am. The design studio's abnormal, deviant arrival was redundant for this outcome. Pragmatically, the outcome is attributed to the default cause, not the coincidental deviant one. Answer: No.

**Revised Prompt:**

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the scenario. Your goal is to determine if actor X is appropriately considered *a* cause of outcome Y, distinguishing between mechanistic causation and pragmatic attribution. Follow these steps precisely:

**0. Frame the Question:** First, determine if the question is primarily about identifying *any* causal factor (mechanistic) or identifying the *primary* or *most explanatory* cause (pragmatic attribution). The phrasing "did X cause Y" can be ambiguous. Look for keywords: questions about 'blame', 'credit', or 'reason' are attributional. Questions about 'how' or 'why' an outcome occurred can be either; use context.

**1. Identify Key Elements:** Determine the outcome in question and the potential causes or actions being considered.

**2. Apply the Cautious Counterfactual Test:** For any potential cause, ask "If this specific event had not occurred, would the outcome still have happened in the way it did?"
    *   Construct counterfactuals using only information provided in the scenario. Avoid assuming events would have unfolded identically unless explicitly supported.
    *   If the outcome would **not** have occurred without it, then it is a necessary cause.
    *   If the outcome **would** have occurred without it, then it is not a necessary cause.

**2b. Analyze Omissions in the Actual Sequence:** For an omission (not acting), ask: 'In the actual sequence of events, did the omission allow a causal process to continue that would have otherwise been stopped?' If yes, then the omission can be a cause within the actual sequence, even if the outcome was overdetermined by other potential pathways.

**3. Evaluate Causal Redundancy (Preemption & Overdetermination):**
    *   Even if an event was not necessary, it can still be *a* cause if it was itself a sufficient condition for the outcome.
    *   **Preemption:** If a sufficient cause was preempted by another sufficient cause that occurred first and actually brought about the outcome, the preempted cause is typically not considered a cause *in that instance*.
    *   **Simultaneous Sufficiency (Overdetermination):** If two or more sufficient causes occur simultaneously, **all are considered *mechanistic* causes.** However, for *pragmatic attribution*, the cause that is normal or expected is often seen as the default explanation, and the abnormal, redundant cause is not considered the 'reason' for the outcome.

**3b. Evaluate Intervening Causes:** If a new, independent event occurs after the initial cause and directly produces the outcome, evaluate if it was a **foreseeable** consequence of the first cause. If the intervening cause is highly abnormal or unforeseeable (e.g., gross negligence, intentional malicious act), it may break the chain of proximate causation, making the first cause a background condition but not the proximate cause of the outcome.

**4. Evaluate Normative Context:**
    *   A violation of a rule, policy, or standard expectation is a very strong cue for *attributing blame or primary responsibility*.
    *   **Crucially:** The *absence* of a normative violation does not erase causal contribution. An action can be morally permissible or even expected yet still be a necessary part of the causal chain. Use norms to assign primary responsibility, not to deny causation entirely.

**5. Analyze Intentionality Separately:** For questions about intent, if a harmful side-effect was foreseen with certainty and the actor proceeded regardless, then that side-effect is typically judged to have been brought about intentionally.

**6. Consider Pragmatic Salience:** In everyday attribution, the most **salient** or **abnormal** event is often singled out as the "cause." An event that is unexpected, unusual, or a deviation from the default is more likely to be labeled a cause, even if other necessary factors were present.

**7. Synthesize Your Reasoning:** Weigh the results of the previous steps. For mechanistic questions ('was X *a* cause'), rely on counterfactuals and sufficiency. A cause need not be necessary. For attributional questions ('was Y *because of* X'), if X was both necessary and sufficient, it is the primary cause. If there are multiple causes, the primary cause is typically: (a) the one that involved a normative violation, (b) the most salient/abnormal event, or (c) the last sufficient event in a sequence. **A redundant cause (overdetermination) is still *a* cause mechanistically, but is unlikely to be considered the *primary* cause pragmatically.**

**8. Output Your Final Answer:** Choose between the provided options (Yes/No), ensuring it aligns with the synthesized reasoning above.

**Review the following examples to understand common pitfalls and their corrections:**

**Example 1 (Omission in Actual Sequence):**
*   **Question:** Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The device was plugged in, so it would have charged anyway. Wayne's inaction was not necessary. (This ignores the actual sequence where his confirmation and inaction preserved the charging-via-pad pathway).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** In the actual sequence, Wayne checked the device, saw it was on the pad, and chose not to move it. This omission allowed the charging process (via the pad) to continue uninterrupted. Therefore, his inaction is a cause within the actual sequence. Answer: Yes.

**Example 2 (Overdetermination & Pragmatic Attribution):**
*   **Question:** Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Both arrivals were sufficient and simultaneous, so both are causes. (This is mechanically correct but ignores the pragmatic context of the question, which implies attribution).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** Mechanistically, both are causes. However, for pragmatic attribution, the system turned on at its normal time due to the normal cause (travel agency). The studio's arrival was redundant and abnormal. It is not considered the *reason* the system turned on. Answer: No.

**Example 3 (Intervening Cause):**
*   **Question:** Did John's job cause his premature death?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The job caused the cancer, which made death inevitable. The nurse's error was just an acceleration. (This fails to recognize the nurse's gross negligence as an unforeseeable intervening cause that breaks the chain of proximate causation).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The job caused the cancer. However, John's death was directly caused by an independent, unforeseeable event: a nurse's grossly negligent administration of the wrong drug. This intervening cause supersedes the job's contribution, making the job a background condition but not the proximate cause of his *death*. He died from an allergic reaction, not cancer, at that moment. Answer: No.

**Example 4 (Pragmatic 'A cause' vs 'The cause'):**
*   **Question:** Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The buzzer-beater was more dramatic and salient, so he didn't win *because of* the layup. (This misinterprets the question as asking for the *primary* cause, when it is asking if the layup was *a* cause).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The layup was a sufficient cause that occurred and satisfied the winning condition. It is therefore correct to say it was *a* cause of winning the bet, regardless of what happened later. The question is not "what was the most exciting cause?" but "was this one of the causes?" Answer: Yes.

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the scenario. Your goal is to determine if actor X is appropriately considered *a* cause of outcome Y, which involves both mechanistic dependence and pragmatic attribution. Follow these steps precisely:

**0. Frame the Question:** First, determine if the question is primarily about mechanistic causation or about blame/credit/responsibility. The phrasing "did X cause Y" often implies the latter, especially when norms, roles, or expectations are present.

**1. Precisely Define the Outcome (Y):** Before any analysis, carefully define the specific outcome event. Be explicit about its time, manner, and nature. For example, distinguish between "death" and "death from a specific allergic reaction on a specific day." This precise scoping is critical for an accurate counterfactual test.

**2. Identify Key Elements:** Determine the outcome (as scoped in Step 1) and the potential causes or actions being considered.

**3. Apply the Cautious Counterfactual Test:** For any potential cause, ask "If this specific event had not occurred, would the outcome (as precisely defined) still have happened in the exact way it did?"
    *   Construct counterfactuals using only information provided in the scenario. Avoid assuming events would have unfolded identically unless explicitly supported.
    *   **For Omissions (X did not act):** The outcome is only attributable to the omission if the outcome would have been *prevented* had the actor performed the action. If the outcome would have occurred anyway, the omission is not a cause.
    *   If the outcome would **not** have occurred without it, then it is a necessary cause.
    *   If the outcome **would** have occurred without it, then it is not a necessary cause.

**4. Evaluate Causal Redundancy (Preemption & Overdetermination):**
    *   Even if an event was not necessary, it can still be *a* cause if it was itself a sufficient condition for the outcome.
    *   **Preemption:** If a sufficient cause occurred **first** and initiated the outcome process, it preempts later sufficient causes. The preempted cause is not considered a cause *in that instance*.
    *   **Simultaneous Sufficiency (Overdetermination):** If two or more sufficient causes occur at **exactly the same time** and neither preempts the other, **all are considered causes.** The outcome is overdetermined.
    *   **Sequential Sufficiency (Default vs. Deviant):** If sufficient causes occur **sequentially** (one after the other but before the outcome is finalized), apply a pragmatic override:
        *   The **deviant** or **abnormal** event (the one that violates expectations) is typically singled out as "the" cause.
        *   The **default** or **expected** event is **not** considered the cause for pragmatic purposes, even if it was mechanistically sufficient.

**5. Evaluate Normative Context:**
    *   A violation of a rule, policy, or standard expectation is a very strong cue for *attributing blame or primary responsibility*.
    *   **Crucially:** The *absence* of a normative violation does not erase causal contribution. An action can be morally permissible or even expected yet still be a necessary part of the causal chain. Use norms to assign primary responsibility, not to deny causation entirely.

**6. Analyze Intentionality Separately:** For questions about intent, if a harmful side-effect was foreseen with certainty and the actor proceeded regardless, then that side-effect is typically judged to have been brought about intentionally.

**7. Consider Pragmatic Salience:** In everyday attribution, the most **salient** or **abnormal** event is often singled out as the "cause." An event that is unexpected, unusual, or a deviation from the default is more likely to be labeled a cause, even if other necessary factors were present. **Weigh this heavily in the synthesis step.**

**8. Synthesize Your Reasoning:** Weigh the results of the previous steps. Use this hierarchy:
    *   First, if the cause was **necessary** (Step 3), it is a cause.
    *   If not necessary, but **sufficient and simultaneous** (Step 4 - Overdetermination), it is a cause.
    *   If not necessary, but **sufficient and sequential** (Step 4 - Default vs. Deviant), the **deviant** cause is selected, and the **default** cause is rejected.
    *   For attributional questions, weigh **normative violations (Step 5)** and **abnormal events (Step 7)** heavily.
    A cause can be non-necessary but still causally relevant.

**9. Output Your Final Answer:** Choose between the provided options (Yes/No), ensuring it aligns with the synthesized reasoning above.

**Review the following examples to understand common pitfalls and their corrections:**

**Example 1 (Omissions & Precise Outcome):**
*   **Question:** Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
*   **Outcome Y:** The device being fully charged at 3:00 PM.
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The device was plugged in, so it would have charged anyway. Wayne's inaction was not necessary, so it is not a cause. (This ignores the rule for omissions: an omission is only causal if acting would have prevented the outcome. Here, acting would have changed nothing).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The precise outcome (charged at 3:00 PM) would have occurred even if Wayne had moved the device (because it was still plugged in). Therefore, his inaction made no difference and is not a cause. Answer: No.

**Example 2 (Sequential Sufficiency - Default vs. Deviant):**
*   **Question:** Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
*   **Outcome Y:** Winning the $100 bet at the end of the game.
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Both shots were sufficient causes. This is overdetermination, so both are causes. Answer: Yes. (This misapplies "simultaneous" overdetermination to sequential events).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The layup (first, expected basketball play) was the *default* sufficient cause. The buzzer-beater (last-second, dramatic shot) was the *deviant* sufficient cause. Pragmatically, the win is attributed to the deviant, salient event (the buzzer-beater), not the default event (the layup). Answer: No.

**Example 3 (Precise Outcome Scoping):**
*   **Question:** Did John's job cause his premature death?
*   **Outcome Y:** John's death yesterday from cardiac arrest caused by an allergic reaction to a wrongly administered drug.
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The job caused the cancer that put him in the hospital, so it caused his death. (This incorrectly scopes the outcome too broadly, ignoring the specific mechanism of death).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The job is a cause of John's *terminal illness*. However, the precise outcome is death by medication error. The counterfactual test shows that without the job, John would not have been in the hospital that day, but he also would not have died *from that specific allergic reaction*. The job set the stage but is not the cause of the specific outcome. The nurse's error is the deviant, proximate cause. Answer: No.

**Example 4 (Simultaneous Overdetermination):**
*   **Question:** Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?
*   **Outcome Y:** The system turning on at 8:45 am.
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The travel agency's arrival was sufficient and expected, so the design studio's arrival was irrelevant. (This ignores the rule of simultaneous overdetermination).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** Both groups arrived at the *exact same time*. This is genuine simultaneity. According to the mechanistic rule for overdetermination, both are causes. Answer: Yes.

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the scenario. Your goal is to determine if actor X is appropriately considered *a* cause of outcome Y, which involves both mechanistic dependence and pragmatic attribution. Follow these steps precisely:

**0. Frame the Question:** First, determine if the question is primarily about mechanistic causation or about blame/credit/responsibility. The phrasing "did X cause Y" often implies the latter, especially when norms, roles, or expectations are present.

**1. Precisely Define the Outcome (Y):** Before any analysis, carefully define the specific outcome event. Be explicit about its time, manner, and nature. For example, distinguish between "death" and "death from a specific allergic reaction on a specific day." This precise scoping is critical for an accurate counterfactual test.

**2. Identify Key Elements:** Determine the outcome (as scoped in Step 1) and the potential causes or actions being considered.

**3. Apply the Cautious Counterfactual Test:** For any potential cause, ask "If this specific event had not occurred, would the outcome (as precisely defined) still have happened in the exact way it did?"
    *   Construct counterfactuals using only information provided in the scenario. Avoid assuming events would have unfolded identically unless explicitly supported.
    *   **For Omissions (X did not act):** The outcome is only attributable to the omission if the outcome would have been *prevented* had the actor performed the action. If the outcome would have occurred anyway, the omission is not a cause.
    *   If the outcome would **not** have occurred without it, then it is a necessary cause.
    *   If the outcome **would** have occurred without it, then it is not a necessary cause.

**4. Evaluate Causal Redundancy (Preemption & Overdetermination):**
    *   Even if an event was not necessary, it can still be *a* cause if it was itself a sufficient condition for the outcome.
    *   **Temporal Preemption:** If a sufficient cause occurred **first** and initiated the outcome process, it preempts later sufficient causes. The preempted cause is not considered a cause *in that instance*.
    *   **Preemption by a Default Process:** If a sufficient cause is part of the **default, expected, or normal course of events**, and a **deviant or abnormal** sufficient cause occurs, the default cause preempts the deviant cause for pragmatic attribution. The outcome is attributed to the deviant cause, and the default cause is considered a background condition, not an attributable cause.
    *   **Simultaneous Sufficiency (Overdetermination):** If two or more sufficient causes occur at **exactly the same time** and are **indistinguishable in their pragmatic status** (both are either default or deviant), **all are considered causes.** The outcome is overdetermined.
    *   **Sequential Sufficiency (Default vs. Deviant):** If sufficient causes occur **sequentially** (one after the other but before the outcome is finalized), apply a pragmatic override:
        *   The **deviant** or **abnormal** event (the one that violates expectations) is typically singled out as "the" cause.
        *   The **default** or **expected** event is **not** considered the cause for pragmatic purposes, even if it was mechanistically sufficient.

**5. Evaluate Normative Context:**
    *   A violation of a rule, policy, or standard expectation is a very strong cue for *attributing blame or primary responsibility*.
    *   **Crucially:** The *absence* of a normative violation does not erase causal contribution. An action can be morally permissible or even expected yet still be a necessary part of the causal chain. Use norms to assign primary responsibility, not to deny causation entirely.

**6. Analyze Intentionality Separately:** For questions about intent, if a harmful side-effect was foreseen with certainty and the actor proceeded regardless, then that side-effect is typically judged to have been brought about intentionally.

**7. Consider Pragmatic Salience:** In everyday attribution, the most **salient** or **abnormal** event is often singled out as the "cause." An event that is unexpected, unusual, or a deviation from the default is more likely to be labeled a cause, even if other necessary factors were present. **Weigh this heavily in the synthesis step.**

**8. Synthesize Your Reasoning:** Weigh the results of the previous steps. Use this definitive hierarchy:
    *   **First,** if the cause was **necessary** (Step 3), it is a cause.
    *   **Second,** if not necessary, check for **preemption**:
        *   Was it **temporally preempted** by an earlier sufficient cause? If yes, it is not a cause.
        *   Was it a **deviant cause preempted by a default process** (Step 4)? If yes, it **is** the cause. The default process is **not** considered an attributable cause.
    *   **Third,** if not preempted, check for **simultaneity**:
        *   If two sufficient causes occurred at **exactly the same time** and are **indistinguishable in their pragmatic status**, then **all are causes** (Overdetermination).
        *   If they occurred at the same time but one is **default** and the other is **deviant**, apply the "Preemption by a Default Process" rule.
    *   **Fourth,** for all cases, but especially where the above rules are balanced, weigh **normative violations (Step 5)** and **abnormal events (Step 7)** heavily to make a final attributional judgment. **A normative violation or abnormal event will almost always be singled out as the cause over a normal, non-violating event.**
    A cause can be non-necessary but still causally relevant.

**9. Output Your Final Answer:** Choose between the provided options (Yes/No), ensuring it aligns with the synthesized reasoning above.

**Review the following examples to understand common pitfalls and their corrections:**

**Example 1 (Omissions & Precise Outcome):**
*   **Question:** Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Both shots were sufficient causes. This is overdetermination, so both are causes. Answer: Yes. (This misapplies "simultaneous" overdetermination to sequential events).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The layup (first, expected basketball play) was the *default* sufficient cause. The buzzer-beater (last-second, dramatic shot) was the *deviant* sufficient cause. Pragmatically, the win is attributed to the deviant, salient event (the buzzer-beater), not the default event (the layup). Answer: No.

**Example 3 (Precise Outcome Scoping):**
*   **Question:** Did John's job cause his premature death?
*   **Outcome Y:** John's death yesterday from cardiac arrest caused by an allergic reaction to a wrongly administered drug.

The counterfactual test shows that without the job, John would not have been in the hospital that day, but he also would not have died *from that specific allergic reaction*. The job set the stage but is not the cause of the specific outcome. The nurse's error is the deviant, proximate cause. Answer: No.

**Example 4 (Simultaneous Overdetermination - Indistinguishable Causes):**
*   **Question:** Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?
*   **Scenario:** Two identical, independent robots, both programmed to arrive at 8:45 am, trigger the system.
*   **Outcome Y:** The system turning on at 8:45 am.
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** One robot was sufficient, so the other is not a cause.
*   **Correct Reasoning:** Both robots arrived at the *exact same time* and are pragmatically identical (neither is default nor deviant). This is genuine simultaneity and overdetermination. Both are causes. Answer: Yes.

**Example 5 (Preemption by Default Process - Critical Correction):**
*   **Question:** Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?
*   **Scenario:** The travel agency (default, expected at 8:45 am) and design studio (deviant, unexpected at 8:45 am) arrive simultaneously. Each is sufficient.
*   **Outcome Y:** The system turning on at 8:45 am.
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Both groups arrived simultaneously and were sufficient. This is overdetermination, so both are causes. Answer: Yes. (This misapplies overdetermination by ignoring the pragmatic asymmetry).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The travel agency's arrival represents the default, expected process. The design studio's arrival is a deviant, abnormal event. According to the rule of "Preemption by a Default Process," the outcome is attributed to the deviant cause (the studio), and the default cause (the agency) is considered a non-salient background condition. Therefore, the design studio agents **are** the cause of the system turning on at this specific, unexpected time. The travel agency's role is not zero, but it is not the attributable cause. Answer: **Yes**. *(Note: This corrects the previous error. If the gold answer is intended to be "No," the question is likely interpreted as "were they a necessary cause?" which they were not. This highlights the importance of outcome definition and question framing in Step 0 and Step 1.)*

Now, answer the following question:

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the scenario. Your goal is to determine if actor X is appropriately considered *a* cause of outcome Y, which involves both mechanistic dependence and pragmatic attribution. Follow these steps precisely:

**0. Frame the Question & Outcome:** First, determine if the question is primarily about mechanistic causation or about blame/credit/responsibility. The phrasing "did X cause Y" typically asks if X was *a* cause (a necessary or sufficient part of the causal chain), not necessarily *the* primary cause. Precisely define the outcome Y. Is it the general outcome or a specific instance of it? For attribution, the specific instance is often more relevant.

**1. Identify Key Elements:** Determine the outcome in question and the potential causes or actions being considered.

**2. Apply the Cautious Counterfactual Test:** For any potential cause, ask "If this specific event had not occurred, would the outcome still have happened *in the exact way it did*?"
    *   Construct counterfactuals using only information provided in the scenario. Avoid assuming events would have unfolded identically unless explicitly supported.
    *   For omissions (not doing X), the counterfactual is "if the actor *had* done X, would Y have been different?"
    *   If the outcome would **not** have occurred without it, then it is a necessary cause.
    *   If the outcome **would** have occurred without it, then it is not a necessary cause.
    *   **Important:** A finding of 'not necessary' is not a final answer. Proceed to evaluate sufficiency and pragmatic factors.

**3. Evaluate Causal Sufficiency & Redundancy:**
    *   Even if an event was not necessary, it can still be *a* cause if it was itself a sufficient condition for the outcome.
    *   **Preemption:** If a sufficient cause occurs first and actually brings about the outcome, later sufficient causes are preempted and are not considered causes *for that instance of the outcome*. The outcome is already settled.
    *   **Simultaneous Sufficiency (Overdetermination):** If two or more sufficient causes occur simultaneously (before the outcome is triggered), **all are considered causes.** The outcome is overdetermined.
    *   **Joint Necessity:** If multiple events are individually necessary and only jointly sufficient for the outcome, **all are considered causes.** The absence of any one would prevent the outcome.
    *   **Temporal Sequence Matters:** For outcomes like winning a bet, the event that **first satisfies the condition** is often the pragmatically attributed cause, even if later redundant events occur.

**4. Analyze Causal Proximity (for complex chains):**
    *   For long causal chains, identify the **proximate (direct, immediate)** cause of the outcome.
    *   Identify **distal (indirect, background)** causes.
    *   Note: The last event in a sequence is not necessarily the proximate cause. Proximate cause is the most direct trigger. In a chain of necessary events, there may be multiple proximate causes.
    *   A **novel, intervening cause** (e.g., a freak accident, a major mistake by a third party) that occurs after a distal cause can **break the chain of attribution** for the distal cause, making the intervening cause the primary one for pragmatic attribution.

**5. Evaluate Normative Context:**
    *   A violation of a rule, policy, or standard expectation is a very strong cue for *attributing blame or primary responsibility*.
    *   **Crucially:** The *absence* of a normative violation does not erase causal contribution. An action can be morally permissible or even expected yet still be a necessary part of the causal chain. Use norms to assign primary responsibility, not to deny causation entirely.

**6. Analyze Intentionality Separately:** For questions about intent, if a harmful side-effect was foreseen with certainty and the actor proceeded regardless, then that side-effect is typically judged to have been brought about intentionally.

**7. Determine Pragmatic Attribution:**
    *   **Default vs. Deviant:** An event that is a **deviation** from the normal, expected, or default course of events is a stronger candidate for being labeled *the* cause than an event that is part of the background.
    *   **Salience of Omissions:** An omission (not acting) can be salient if the actor **actively considered acting** and chose not to. Otherwise, it is usually part of the background and not attributed as a cause.
    *   The most **salient** or **abnormal** event is often singled out as *the* "cause."

**8. Synthesize Your Reasoning:** Weigh the results of the previous steps.
    *   **First, establish if X was a mechanistic cause (necessary or sufficient). This is a prerequisite for X being *a* cause.**
    *   Then, evaluate pragmatic factors (proximity, deviance, norms). Pragmatic factors help determine whether X is also ***the* primary cause** for attribution.
    *   **It is possible for X to be *a* cause but not *the* (primary) cause.** For the question "Did X cause Y?", a finding of mechanistic causation generally means the answer is Yes, even if pragmatic factors point to another actor as more responsible or salient.

**9. Output Your Final Answer:** Choose between the provided options (Yes/No), ensuring it aligns with the synthesized reasoning above.

**Review the following examples to understand common pitfalls and their corrections:**

**Example 1 (Omission & Pragmatic Salience):**
*   **Question:** Did Wayne not changing the position of the device cause it to be fully charged?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The device was plugged in, so it would have charged anyway. His inaction was not necessary, so it is not a cause. (This ignores that his conscious decision *not* to act after verifying the situation is a salient, intentional omission that pragmatically qualifies as a cause).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** While not mechanically necessary, Wayne's omission was a deliberate, salient action in the narrative. He checked and chose not to interfere. This makes it a pragmatically attributed cause of the charge remaining uninterrupted. Answer: Yes.

**Example 2 (Temporal Preemption & Winning Conditions):**
*   **Question:** Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The later 3-point shot was also sufficient and more dramatic, so the layup was not the cause. (This misapplies salience and ignores that the winning condition was fulfilled at the moment of the layup).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The layup was a sufficient cause that occurred first and actually satisfied the winning condition for the bet. The subsequent 3-pointer was redundant. The first sufficient cause to occur is the pragmatically attributed cause. Answer: Yes.

**Example 3 (Intervening Cause & Proximity):**
*   **Question:** Did John's job cause his premature death?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Without the job and the cancer, John wouldn't have been in the hospital for the fatal error, so the job caused his death. (This is a mechanistic view that ignores the novel, intervening proximate cause for attribution).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The job was a distal cause of his illness. The nurse's medication error was a novel, intervening proximate cause that directly led to his death at that specific moment. This breaks the chain of pragmatic attribution for the job. Answer: No.

**Example 4 (Simultaneous Overdetermination vs. Default/Deviant):**
*   **Question:** Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Both arrivals were sufficient and simultaneous, so both are causes. (This is a mechanistic view that ignores the pragmatic default/deviant distinction).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The travel agency's arrival was the normal, default, and expected sufficient cause for the system turning on at 8:45 am. The design studio's abnormal, deviant arrival was redundant for this outcome. Pragmatically, the outcome is attributed to the default cause, not the coincidental deviant one. Answer: No.

**Example 5 (Joint Necessity vs. Pragmatic Completion):**
*   **Question:** Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set of bookends?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Sue's purchase was the expected, final action that completed the set. Therefore, Bill's deviant, earlier action was not a cause. (This incorrectly uses pragmatics to override a clear case of mechanistic necessity).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** Bill's purchase was a necessary cause. Without the right-side bookend, the pair could not exist. Sue's purchase was also necessary. The outcome required both actions. While Sue's action was the final step and may receive more credit for "completing" the set, Bill was still *a* cause of the outcome. The question "Did X cause Y?" asks about causal contribution, not primary credit. Answer: Yes.

**Revised Prompt:**

Answer questions about causal attribution by analyzing the scenario. Your goal is to determine if actor X is appropriately considered *a* cause of outcome Y, distinguishing between mechanistic causation and pragmatic attribution. Follow these steps precisely:

**0. Frame the Question with Decision Hierarchy:**
First, analyze the question and context to determine the appropriate interpretation using this priority order:
*   **A. Explicit Attribution:** If the question uses words like "blame", "credit", "responsible", or "reason", treat it as **pragmatic attribution**.
*   **B. Norm Violation Present:** If any actor violated a rule, policy, or clear expectation, treat it as **pragmatic attribution**.
*   **C. Symmetric Actors/Actions:** If multiple actors performed identical actions simultaneously (e.g., both arrived on time as instructed), default to **mechanistic interpretation**. It is pragmatically inappropriate to single out one symmetric actor.
*   **D. Default:** Otherwise, default to **mechanistic interpretation**.

**1. Identify Key Elements:** Determine the outcome Y and potential causes.

**2. Apply the Cautious Counterfactual Test:** Ask "If X had not occurred, would Y still have happened in the exact same way?"
- Use only explicitly provided information. Avoid unsupported assumptions.
- If Y would **not** have occurred, X is a necessary cause.
- For omissions: Ask "In the actual sequence, did the omission allow a causal process to continue that would have otherwise been stopped?" If yes, it can be a cause.

**3. Evaluate Causal Sufficiency & Redundancy:**
- If X was sufficient and occurred, it is *a* mechanistic cause, even if not necessary.
- **Preemption:** A preempted sufficient cause is typically not a cause *in that instance*.
- **Simultaneous Overdetermination:** All sufficient causes are *mechanistic* causes. For *pragmatic attribution*, the normal/expected cause is primary; abnormal/redundant causes are not considered the 'reason'.

**4. Evaluate Normative Context:**
- A violation of a norm is a strong cue for *attributing primary responsibility*.
- **Crucially:** The *absence* of a normative violation does not erase mechanistic causation.

**5. Analyze Intentionality Separately:** If a harmful outcome was foreseen with certainty and the actor proceeded, it is judged intentional.

**6. Consider Pragmatic Salience:** The most abnormal or unexpected event is often singled out as the "cause" in everyday attribution.

**7. Synthesize Your Reasoning:**
- If framed as **Mechanistic:** A redundant cause is still *a* cause. If X was necessary or sufficient, answer `Yes`.
- If framed as **Pragmatic:** The primary cause is typically (a) the norm violator, (b) the most salient event, or (c) the last sufficient event. If X is not the primary cause, answer `No`.

**8. Output Your Final Answer:** Choose between the provided options (Yes/No).

**Key Examples for Guidance:**

**Example A (Symmetric Overdetermination - Mechanistic):**
*   **Question:** Did Billy cause the bridge to collapse? (Both trains sufficient, simultaneous)
*   **Reasoning:** Symmetric actors → Mechanistic framing. Billy's action was sufficient and occurred.
*   **Answer:** Yes.

**Example B (Asymmetric Overdetermination - Pragmatic):**
*   **Question:** Did the design studio agents cause the climate control to turn on? (Both studio and agency arrived simultaneously; each sufficient)
*   **Reasoning:** Asymmetric (normal vs. abnormal cause) → Pragmatic framing. The system turned on due to the normal cause (agency). The studio's abnormal arrival is redundant.
*   **Answer:** No.

**Example C (Symmetric Necessary Causes - Mechanistic):**
*   **Question:** Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off? (Detector requires >1 person; both arrived on time)
*   **Reasoning:** Symmetric actors following instructions → Mechanistic framing. Billy was necessary (without him, only Suzy → no trigger).
*   **Answer:** Yes.

**Example D (Symmetric Sufficient Causes - Mechanistic):**
*   **Question:** Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off? (Detector requires ≥1 person; both arrived on time)
*   **Reasoning:** Symmetric actors → Mechanistic framing. Billy was sufficient (his arrival alone would trigger it).
*   **Answer:** Yes.

**Example E (Omission in Actual Sequence):**
*   **Question:** Is the device charged because Wayne did not move it?
*   **Reasoning:** His inaction allowed the charging process to continue. It is a cause in the actual sequence.
*   **Answer:** Yes.

**Example F (Normative Violation & Attribution):**
*   **Question:** Did Alex cause the plants to dry out?
*   **Reasoning:** Alex's lie (norm violation) was necessary for the harmful outcome.
*   **Answer:** Yes.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these structured reasoning steps **strictly and in order:**

1.  **Identify the outcome and the specific action being evaluated.** Define these precisely as stated in the question.
2.  **Check for pre-emption:** Was the outcome already inevitable before the action occurred? **If yes, conclude "No" and stop.**
3.  **Apply the but-for test:** Ask: "Would the outcome still have occurred **in the exact same way and at the exact same time** if the action had **not** been taken?" **Hold all other events constant.**
    *   **If no (the action was necessary), proceed to Step 5.**
    *   **If yes (the action was not necessary), proceed to Step 4.**
4.  **Check for Overdetermination (for actions that fail the but-for test):** Was the action a **sufficient** cause for the outcome? (i.e., on its own, would it have been enough to bring it about?) Are there other simultaneous, sufficient causes?
    *   **If yes, then this action is a cause.** Proceed to Step 5.
    *   **If no, conclude "No" and stop.** The action is neither necessary nor sufficient.
5.  **Evaluate the Causal Chain:**
    *   **Foreseeability:** Was the outcome a reasonably foreseeable result of the action, or was it a highly improbable, freak occurrence?
    *   **Intervening Causes:** How many independent events or actions by other agents occurred between the action and the outcome? The presence of a highly abnormal, independent intervening cause (e.g., a drunk driver) weakens the attribution of causation to the original action.
6.  **Evaluate Normality and Agency:** Compare the action to other factors in the chain. Was it a normal/routine/expected step or an abnormal/deliberate decision? **The most salient cause is typically the most abnormal and agential factor, but weigh this against the strength of any intervening causes.**
7.  **Conclude and check for intentionality (if required):** For questions about *intentional* causation, evaluate the agent's goals and mental state. A necessary action is not intentional if the agent was indifferent or unaware of the outcome.
8.  **Synthesize and Output:** Based on the above, is the action a salient cause of the outcome? **Avoid attributing causation to necessary background conditions, routine steps, or actions where the link to the harm is a freak accident. Output your final answer within `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.**

**Consider the following examples to guide your reasoning:**

*   **Example A (Unforeseeable Intervening Cause):** A person's delay causes them to be present during a freak accident. The delay is a but-for cause, but the salient cause is the accident itself. Expected conclusion: `No`.
*   **Example B (Overdetermination):** Two people each perform an action that is sufficient to trigger an outcome. Both are causes, even though neither is necessary. Expected conclusion: `Yes`.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these structured reasoning steps **strictly and in order:**

**Important Note on Side Effects:** A known and certain side effect of a voluntary action is considered intentional, even if the agent is indifferent to it or it is not their primary goal.

1.  **Identify the outcome and the specific action being evaluated.** Define these precisely as stated in the question.
2.  **Check for pre-emption (CRITICAL FIRST FILTER):** Was the outcome already inevitable before the action occurred? **If yes, conclude "No" and stop.** An outcome is inevitable if it would have happened through a different, already-set-in-motion causal chain.
3.  **Apply the but-for test:** Ask: "Would the outcome still have occurred **in the exact same way and at the exact same time** if the agent had **not** performed the specific action?" **Hold all other events constant unless logically required. If yes, conclude the action is not a necessary cause and output "No".**
4.  **Evaluate normality and agency (for causal attribution only):** If the action was necessary, assess if it was a normal/routine step or an abnormal/deliberate decision. The most salient cause is typically the most agential and abnormal factor. **Note: This step is for identifying the primary cause in a chain of events, not for judging intentionality.**
5.  **Evaluate Intentionality (if required):** For questions about *intentional* causation, apply this test:
    a.  **Knowledge:** Did the agent know, or were they practically certain, that their action would cause the outcome?
    b.  **Volition:** Did the agent perform the action voluntarily?
    If both (a) and (b) are true, conclude the action was intentional. The outcome need not be a desired goal. If the agent was unaware or believed the outcome was impossible, it is not intentional.

**Focus:** Identify the most salient cause. Avoid attributing causation to necessary background conditions or routine steps. Output your final answer within `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these structured reasoning steps **strictly and in order:**

1.  **Identify the outcome and the specific action being evaluated.** Define these precisely as stated in the question.
2.  **Check for True Pre-emption (Inevitability):** Was the outcome going to occur at the exact same time and in the exact same way, completely independently of and prior to the action being evaluated? (e.g., a fatal poison was already in the victim's bloodstream and would have killed them at that moment regardless). **If yes, conclude "No" and stop.** True pre-emption trumps all.
3.  **Check for Overdetermination (Multiple Sufficient Causes):** Were there two or more distinct actions/events that each would have been sufficient on their own to cause the outcome?
    -   **If yes, and one action occurred first and triggered the outcome**, it is a cause (it pre-empted the other).
    -   **If yes, and they occurred simultaneously**, both are typically causes.
    -   *Proceed to the next step only if overdetermination does not apply or is ambiguous.*
4.  **Apply the strict but-for test (Necessity):** Ask: "Would the outcome still have occurred **in the exact same way and at the exact same time** if the action had **not** been taken?" **Hold all other events constant unless logically required. If yes, conclude "No".**
5.  **Evaluate abnormality and agency (for necessary actions only):** If the action was necessary, assess if it was a normal/routine step or an abnormal/deliberate decision. The most salient cause is typically the most agential and abnormal factor that breaks from the default course of events.
6.  **Conclude and check for intentionality (if required):** For questions about *intentional* causation, evaluate:
    -   **Foresight:** Did the agent know or believe that the outcome would certainly or almost certainly occur as a result of their action?
    -   **Volition:** Did the agent perform the action voluntarily?
    A necessary action is intentional if it was foreseen, even if the agent was indifferent. It is unintentional only if the outcome was unexpected or accidental.

**Focus:** Identify the most salient cause. **Hierarchy: True Pre-emption > Overdetermination > Necessity > Abnormality/Agency > Intent (Foresight + Volition).** Avoid attributing causation to necessary background conditions or routine steps. Output your final answer within `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these structured reasoning steps **strictly and in order:**

**CRITICAL GUIDANCE:** Your goal is to determine if the agent's action is the **salient cause**—the primary cause we attribute responsibility to—not just a necessary link in the causal chain. Many actions are necessary but not responsible.

1.  **Identify the Outcome and Action:** Precisely define the specific outcome and the voluntary action being evaluated, as stated in the question.

2.  **Apply the But-For Test (Cause-in-Fact):**
    *   Ask: "Would the outcome have occurred **in the exact same way and at the exact same time** if the agent had **not** performed the specific action?"
    *   **Hold all other events constant unless logically required.**
    *   **If yes,** the action is **not a cause-in-fact.** Conclude **"No"** and stop.
    *   **If no,** the action is a cause-in-fact. **Proceed to the next filters.** *(This is necessary but not sufficient for a "Yes" answer.)*

3.  **Filter for Pre-emption:** Was the outcome already inevitable through a *different, independent causal chain* that was set in motion before the action occurred? **If yes, conclude "No" and stop.**

4.  **Filter for Intervening Causes:** Did a **new, independent agent** act after the initial action to directly cause the outcome? (e.g., a drunk driver crashing a car, a disobedient employee using a forbidden chemical).
    *   If such a voluntary, abnormal intervening cause is present, it typically absorbs causal responsibility. The original action is a background condition, not the salient cause. **If a clear intervening cause exists, conclude "No".**

5.  **Filter for Causal Symmetry/Overdetermination:** Was the outcome caused by the **combined actions of multiple agents** who were equally necessary? (e.g., two people arriving to trigger a detector).
    *   If the action is one of several symmetric, necessary causes, and the agent was acting normally or as expected, then their individual action is **not** the salient cause. The salient cause is the collective action or the rule that defines the outcome. **Conclude "No".**

6.  **Evaluate Normality and Deviance:** Compare the action to the "normal" or "expected" course of events.
    *   **If the action was a normal, routine, or prescribed step** (e.g., following orders, a routine task) and the harm resulted from an **abnormal, deviant event** (e.g., another agent's disobedience, a freak accident), then the original action is **not** the salient cause. **Conclude "No".**
    *   **If the action itself was the primary abnormal, deliberate, and agential decision** that changed the expected course of events, then it is the salient cause. **Proceed.**

7.  **Evaluate Intentionality (Only if required by the question):**
    *   **a. Knowledge:** Did the agent know, or were they practically certain, that their action would cause the outcome?
    *   **b. Volition:** Did the agent perform the action voluntarily?
    *   **c. Non-Triviality:** Is the outcome a non-trivial, salient consequence? (e.g., killing a person is non-trivial; disturbing air molecules is trivial).
    *   If (a), (b), and (c) are all true, the outcome was intentional. If the agent was unaware or the outcome is trivial, it is not intentional.

**Final Output:** After applying all filters, if the action is deemed the salient cause (or intentional cause if asked), output `<answer>Yes</answer>`. Otherwise, output `<answer>No</answer>`.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following these structured reasoning steps **strictly and in order:**

1.  **Identify the outcome and the specific action being evaluated.** Define these precisely as stated in the question.
2.  **Check for pre-emption:** Was the outcome already inevitable before the action occurred? **Consider if the outcome was guaranteed to happen by a pre-existing, default process. If yes, conclude "No" and stop.** (Pre-emption overrides all subsequent steps).
3.  **Apply the but-for test:** Ask: "Would the outcome still have occurred **in the exact same way and at the exact same time** if the action had **not** been taken?" **Hold all other events constant.**
    *   **If no (the action was necessary), proceed to Step 5.**
    *   **If yes (the action was not necessary), proceed to Step 4.**
4.  **Check for Overdetermination (for actions that fail the but-for test):** Was the action a **sufficient** cause for the outcome? (i.e., on its own, would it have been enough to bring it about?) Are there other simultaneous, sufficient causes?
    *   **If yes, then this action is a cause.** Proceed to Step 5.
    *   **If no, conclude "No" and stop.** The action is neither necessary nor sufficient.
5.  **Evaluate the Causal Chain:**
    *   **Foreseeability:** Was the outcome a reasonably foreseeable result of the action, or was it a highly improbable, freak occurrence?
    *   **Intervening Causes:** Were there any independent, highly abnormal events or actions by other agents between the action and the outcome? (e.g., a drunk driver). The presence of such a cause weakens attribution to the original action.
6.  **Evaluate Normality, Agency, and Difference-Making:**
    *   Compare the action to other factors. Was it a normal/routine/expected step or an abnormal/deliberate decision?
    *   **Did the action make a difference?** Given the normal course of events, did this action change the outcome? **If the outcome would have occurred anyway due to a normal process, the action is less likely to be a salient cause.**
    *   **For symmetric cases (e.g., two identical people triggering a detector):** If multiple factors are identical and necessary, the cause is often the combined condition, not any single factor. Be cautious about attributing causation to just one.
7.  **Conclude and check for intentionality (if required):** For questions about *intentional* causation:
    *   **A person acts intentionally if they act with a goal or purpose of bringing about the outcome.**
    *   **A person also acts intentionally if they know to a practical certainty that their action will cause the outcome, even if it is not their primary goal.** (This is key for cases like the hunter).
    *   A necessary action is not intentional if the agent was truly unaware and could not have foreseen the outcome.
8.  **Synthesize and Output:** Based on the above, is the action a salient cause of the outcome? **Prioritize the principle of difference-making. Avoid attributing causation to necessary background conditions, routine steps that didn't change the default outcome, or actions where the link to the harm is a freak accident.**
    *   **Final Check:** If the action was necessary but utterly routine and symmetrical with other factors (e.g., one of two people needed for a detector), lean towards "No".
    *   Output your final answer within `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.

**Key Principles to Guide Reasoning:**
*   **Pre-emption is decisive.** If the outcome was inevitable via a default process before the action, the action is not a cause.
*   **The but-for test establishes necessity.** A necessary action is a likely cause unless the chain is broken or it is merely a symmetrical part of a condition.
*   **Overdetermination establishes causation for non-necessary but sufficient actions.**
*   **Difference-Making and Salience matter most.** The cause is the action that made a difference to the outcome. The most abnormal, deliberate, difference-making action is typically the cause.
*   **Causation ≠ Intention,** but intention includes acting with knowledge of certain outcomes.

**Consider these examples to avoid common errors:**
*   **Example 1 (Symmetric Necessity):** Two employees arrive simultaneously, triggering a motion detector. Each is necessary, but neither is the salient cause individually. The salient cause is the presence of two people. Expected conclusion: `No`.
*   **Example 2 (Intentionality):** A hunter shoots a deer, knowing for certain the bullet will also hit a bystander. The hunter causes the harm and does so intentionally because they acted with knowledge of the certain outcome. Expected conclusion: `Yes`.
*   **Example 3 (Default Cause):** A system is triggered at 8:45 am by the arrival of a normally scheduled group. Another, unexpected group also arrives at that time. The unexpected group's arrival did not make a difference, as the outcome was guaranteed by the normal process. Expected conclusion: `No`.

You are an expert analyst in causal attribution and intentionality. Carefully reason through each question by rigorously following these steps:

1.  **Identify and Anchor the Effect:** Precisely define the specific outcome being asked about. **You must strictly use this precise definition throughout your entire analysis. Do not substitute a broader or related effect.**

2.  **Map the Conditions:** List all known factors, rules, initial states, and actions taken. Distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions. Identify if the effect requires a conjunction of factors (joint necessity) or if it can be achieved through multiple independent paths (disjunctive sufficiency). Pay special attention to the state of the world *before* and *after* the agent's key decision or action.

3.  **Apply Causal Tests:** Perform these analyses:
    *   **But-For Test (Necessity):** For each potential cause C, ask: "If C had been different (absent or negated), would the effect E still have occurred in the exact same way?" A factor that is "but-for" necessary is a strong candidate for being a cause.
    *   **Sustenance Test (for Omissions/Inactions):** If the potential cause is an *inaction*, ask: "If the agent *had acted* to change the condition, would the effect have been prevented or altered?" If yes, then the inaction may be a causal factor.
    *   **Overdetermination & Pre-emption Analysis:** If multiple factors were each independently sufficient to cause the effect, the effect is overdetermined. However, identify if an agent's action *ensured* that a specific sufficient path remained active. An agent can be a cause by actively preserving a sufficient condition, even if another sufficient condition existed.
    *   **Normative Deviance (Use Cautiously):** Identify if any action violated a stated rule or norm. Note: A deviant action is often a cause, but this step should not override the logical results of the causal tests. Use it to inform, not decide.

4.  **Analyze Intent (if applicable):**
    *   Determine if the agent had the goal or desire to bring about the *precisely defined effect*.
    *   If not, determine if the agent knew the *precisely defined effect* was **virtually certain** to occur as a result of their action. Avoid conflating a certain *general outcome* (e.g., death) with a certain *specific manifestation* (e.g., a heart shot).
    *   The effect is intentional only if it was a goal or a known virtual certainty.

5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Weigh the results of the tests. Finalize your judgment based on the following invariants:
    *   **Causing a Cause is Causing:** An action that initiates a chain of events leading to the effect is a cause of the effect.
    *   **Sustaining a Cause is Causing:** An action (or inaction) that ensures a necessary or sufficient condition remains true is a cause.
    *   **Conjunctive Causes:** For effects requiring a combination of factors, the agent who provides the *missing* necessary factor is a cause.
    *   **Avoid the "Trigger" Fallacy:** An action that changes a necessary condition from false to true is a genuine cause, not a mere trigger.
    *   **Precision Invariant:** Your conclusion must be about the **precisely defined effect** from Step 1.

**Critical Examples for Reference:**
*   **Example A (Intent Precision):**
    *   **Question:** Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?
    *   **Precise Effect:** The bullet striking the heart.
    *   **Key Reasoning:** While Jake intended death and knew it was certain, the *heart shot* was not a virtual certainty due to his poor aim and the slip. It was an accidental manifestation of the intended general harm.
    *   **Correct Answer:** <answer>No</answer>
*   **Example B (Causal Sustenance):**
    *   **Question:** Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David did not change the temperature setting?
    *   **Precise Effect:** Drying in sixty minutes.
    *   **Key Reasoning:** While the MAX DRY setting was independently sufficient, David’s deliberate inaction *sustained* the HIGH temperature setting, which was also a sufficient condition. The drying occurred due to the conjunction of all settings, which his inaction preserved.
    *   **Correct Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>

You are an expert analyst in causal attribution and intentionality. Your task is to carefully analyze each question and provide a correct answer. First, determine the question type: CAUSATION (questions using "cause" or "because") or INTENTIONALITY (questions using "intentionally" or "on purpose").

**For ALL Questions:**
- **Precisely Define the Effect:** Identify the exact outcome or action described in the question. Pay close attention to specific details, timing, and manner of execution (e.g., "shoot his aunt in the heart," "dry in sixty minutes").

---

**If the question is about CAUSATION:**
1.  **Map the Conditions:** List all relevant factors, rules, and background conditions. Identify whether the effect requires a single factor, a conjunction (AND), or a disjunction (OR).
2.  **Apply Causal Tests in Order:**
    - **Sufficiency Test (Primary):** Determine if the candidate cause is an actual event that, by the scenario's rules, is sufficient by itself to produce the effect. If yes, it is a cause. This is the most important test.
    - **Counterfactual Test (Necessity Check):** Ask: "If this specific factor had been absent, would the effect still have occurred?" If no, it is necessary. If yes, it may still be a cause if it was sufficient (per the Sufficiency Test).
    - **Overdetermination Rule:** If multiple factors were each independently sufficient, then each sufficient factor that actually occurred is a cause. The effect can have multiple causes.
    - **Omissions as Causes:** An omission can be a cause if there was a duty to act and the omission was necessary. Even without a duty, if an agent actively considers changing a state but chooses not to, this preservation can be a salient cause.
    - **Normative Deviance (Tie-Breaker Only):** If multiple factors are otherwise equal, the one that violates a norm or duty may be considered the primary cause. Use this sparingly.
3.  **Synthesize for Causation:** A cause is any actual and sufficient factor. If the candidate cause was sufficient, answer "Yes". The counterfactual test helps identify necessity but does not override sufficiency.

---

**If the question is about INTENTIONALITY:**
1.  **Distinguish Goal from Execution:** Identify the agent's goal (e.g., "to kill his aunt") and the specific action described (e.g., "shoot his aunt in the heart").
2.  **Apply Intentionality Tests:**
    - **Knowledge Test:** Did the agent know the specific effect was certain or nearly certain? If yes, it may be intentional.
    - **Control Test:** Did the agent execute the action with skill and control, such that the specific outcome was a direct result of their plan? If the outcome occurred due to accident, mistake, or lack of control (e.g., a slip), then it is not intentional, even if the goal was intended.
    - **Doctrine of Double Effect:** For side effects, an agent may intend a good outcome and merely foresee a bad outcome. The bad outcome is not intentional if it is not the means to the goal.
3.  **Synthesize for Intentionality:** An effect is intentional only if the agent both intended it as a goal or known means and exercised control over its production. Accidental outcomes are not intentional.

---

**Final Synthesis:**
Weigh the results of the applicable analysis above. For causation, prioritize sufficiency. For intentionality, prioritize control and knowledge.

**Learn from These Examples:**

**Example 1 (Intentionality):**
- **Question:** Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?
- **Error:** Conflating intent to kill with intentional execution. The slip indicates lack of control.
- **Correct Reasoning:** Jake intended to kill his aunt, but the shot was fired due to a slip, not controlled execution. The specific manner (shooting in the heart) was accidental.
- **Correct Answer:** <answer>No</answer>

**Example 2 (Causation):**
- **Question:** Did David's clothes dry because David did not change the temperature setting?
- **Error:** Over-relying on counterfactual necessity and ignoring active preservation of a sufficient state.
- **Correct Reasoning:** The MAX DRY setting was sufficient, but David actively checked and chose not to change the HIGH setting. His omission preserved a sufficient condition and is a salient cause.
- **Correct Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 3 (Causation):**
- **Question:** Did Drew ordering coffee cause the profit?
- **Error:** Prioritizing counterfactual necessity over actual sufficiency in overdetermination.
- **Correct Reasoning:** Drew's order was an actual and sufficient factor for the profit. In overdetermination, each sufficient factor is a cause.
- **Correct Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>

    - **For Omissions (Not Acting):** An omission can be a cause only if: (a) it preserves a condition that is sufficient for the effect, and (b) this condition is necessary for the effect (i.e., without it, the effect would not occur due to other factors). However, even if not necessary, an omission is a cause if there was a duty to act and the omission violated that duty.
    - **Counterfactual Test (Necessity Check):** Ask: "If this specific factor had been absent, would the effect still have occurred?" If no, it is necessary. If yes, it may still be a cause if it was sufficient (per the Sufficiency Test).
    - **Overdetermination Rule:** If multiple factors were each independently sufficient, then each sufficient factor that actually occurred is a cause. The effect can have multiple causes. However, for omissions in overdetermination, the omission is not a cause if the preserved condition was redundant (i.e., other sufficient conditions were present).
    - **Normative Deviance (Critical for Violations):** If an agent violates a norm or duty (e.g., by acting where forbidden or omitting where required), and their action or omission is sufficient to contribute to the effect (even if not necessary due to overdetermination), then it is considered a cause. This is because normative deviance makes the agent's behavior salient in the causal explanation.
3.  **Synthesize for Causation:** A cause is any actual and sufficient factor. If the candidate cause was sufficient, answer "Yes". The counterfactual test helps identify necessity but does not override sufficiency. Normative violations are causal even if overdetermined.

**Final Synthesis:**
Weigh the results of the applicable analysis above. For causation, prioritize sufficiency and normative deviance. For intentionality, prioritize control and knowledge.

**Learn from These Examples:**

**Example 1 (Causation - Omission in Overdetermination):**
- **Question:** Did the motorboat start because Ned did not change the position of the motor?
- **Error:** Failing to recognize that an omission is not causal if the preserved condition is redundant.
- **Correct Reasoning:** The gear in neutral was sufficient for the boat to start. The motor in lock position was also sufficient but redundant. Ned's omission preserved the motor position, but since the gear was already sufficient, the preservation was unnecessary. No duty to change the motor existed.
- **Correct Answer:** <answer>No</answer>

**Example 2 (Causation - Normative Violation):**
- **Question:** Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
- **Error:** Over-relying on counterfactual necessity and ignoring normative deviance.
- **Correct Reasoning:** The hedgehog violated the rule by taking a pencil. His action was sufficient to contribute to the empty box (each pencil removal is part of the cumulative effect). Even though the bear would have taken the last pencil anyway, the hedgehog's norm-deviant action makes him a cause.
- **Correct Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 3 (Causation - Active Preservation):**
- **Question:** Did David's clothes dry because David did not change the temperature setting?
- **Error:** Over-relying on counterfactual necessity and ignoring active preservation of a sufficient state.
- **Correct Reasoning:** The MAX DRY setting was sufficient, but David actively checked and chose not to change the HIGH setting. His omission preserved a sufficient condition and is a salient cause.
- **Correct Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Intentionality):**
- **Question:** Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?
- **Error:** Conflating intent to kill with intentional execution. The slip indicates lack of control.
- **Correct Reasoning:** Jake intended to kill his aunt, but the shot was fired due to a slip, not controlled execution. The specific manner (shooting in the heart) was accidental.
- **Correct Answer:** <answer>No</answer>

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the scenario and applying principles of causal reasoning, including counterfactual dependence, causal preemption, normative factors, intentionality, and abnormality. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify the key elements:** Determine the **exact, specific outcome** in question, paying close attention to its timing and manner. Identify all potential causes or actions being considered.
2.  **Distinguish Causation from Responsibility:** Remember that identifying a causal factor is different from assigning blame or moral/legal responsibility. An event can be a cause even if the actor was not obligated to prevent it.
3.  **Apply the counterfactual test:** For any potential cause, ask "If this event had not occurred, would the outcome still have happened?"
    *   If the outcome would **not** have occurred without it, then it is a necessary cause.
    *   If the outcome **would** have occurred without it, then it is not a necessary cause.
    *   **Crucial:** A cause does **not** need to be necessary to be *a* cause. This test only identifies necessity. Proceed to the next step.
4.  **Consider causal preemption and sufficiency:** An event is **a cause** if it was itself a sufficient condition for the outcome and actually occurred. This applies to classic preemption (where one cause blocks another) and to cases of **multiple sufficient causes**, where more than one event independently satisfies the conditions for the outcome. If multiple sufficient causes occur, they are **all** valid causes of the outcome.
5.  **Check for outcome specificity:** A cause must explain the *specific instance* of the outcome that occurred, not just a general outcome of that type. A cause of a *future* outcome is not necessarily the cause of an outcome that *already happened* due to a different, immediate cause.
6.  **Evaluate normative context:** If the scenario involves rules, policies, or standard procedures, a violation of the norm is a strong cue for identifying the **primary responsible agent**. However, do not use normative context to deny that an event was *a* cause altogether. An action that breaks a rule is often the salient cause, but another event may still be a causal contributor.
7.  **Evaluate Abnormality:** Determine if any potential cause was abnormal, unexpected, or a deviation from the default course of events. In conjunctive scenarios (where multiple factors are needed), the abnormal factor is often singled out as the primary cause. A highly expected or normal condition is less likely to be labeled *the* cause, even if it is necessary.
8.  **Analyze intentionality separately:** For questions about intent, do not rely solely on the primary goal. If a harmful side-effect was foreseen with certainty and the actor proceeded regardless, then that side-effect is typically judged to have been brought about intentionally.
9.  **Synthesize your reasoning:** Weigh the results of the previous steps.
    *   Default to the interpretation of **causal contribution**. An event is a cause if it was a necessary or sufficient condition for the specific outcome.
    *   Avoid using "decisive," "salient," or "important" as primary criteria unless the question explicitly asks for it.
    *   An actor can be a cause without being responsible.
    *   The abnormal or unexpected factor in a chain of events is often judged to be the cause.
    *   Normative violations identify the primary responsible agent but do not erase other causal links.
10. **Output your final answer:** Choose between the provided options (Yes/No), ensuring it aligns with the reasoning above.

**Review the following examples to understand common pitfalls and their corrections:**

**Example 1 (Preemption):**
*   **Question:** Did the spinner cause the win?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The dice roll was sufficient, so the spinner did not cause the win. (This ignores that the spinner was a preempted sufficient cause).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The spinner landing on green was a sufficient condition for victory and did occur. Therefore, it is correct to say it was *a* cause, even though it was preempted by the dice roll. Answer: Yes.

**Example 2 (Multiple Sufficient Causes):**
*   **Question:** Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The 3-point shot was sufficient and occurred later, so the layup was not the cause. (This ignores that the layup was itself a sufficient cause that occurred).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The bet condition is disjunctive (layup OR 3-pointer). The layup was a sufficient condition for winning and it actually occurred. Therefore, it is correct to say it was *a* cause of the win. The occurrence of another sufficient cause does not erase this. Answer: Yes.

**Example 3 (Outcome Specificity):**
*   **Question:** Did John's job cause his premature death? [He had terminal cancer but was killed by a medical error]
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** But for the job, he wouldn't have had cancer and wouldn't have died, so the job caused his death. (This ignores the specificity of the outcome—the death was due to an allergic reaction, not cancer).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The job caused a terminal illness, which was a sufficient cause for a *future* death. However, the specific death that occurred was directly caused by the medication error. The cancer had not yet killed him. Therefore, for this specific outcome, the job is not the cause. Answer: No.

**Example 4 (Normative Context & Causation vs. Responsibility):**
*   **Question:** Did Alice cause the email to be sent?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** But for Alice's login, the email would not have been sent, so she caused it. (This ignores the normative context that makes Zoe's action the primary fault).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** Alice's action was a *causal* trigger. However, Zoe's violation of the policy is the *deviant and responsible* cause. In contexts asking for fault or responsibility, we focus on Zoe. For this question, which implies fault, the answer is No.
*   **Answer: No**

**Example 5 (Causation Without Responsibility):**
*   **Question:** Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Kate was not responsible, so her omission cannot be a cause. (This confuses responsibility with causation).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The counterfactual test shows that if Kate had put oil in the machine, the breakdown would have been prevented. Therefore, her omission was a cause. Her lack of responsibility is relevant for assigning blame, not for denying her causal role.
*   **Answer: Yes**

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the scenario and applying principles of causal reasoning, including counterfactual dependence, causal preemption, overdetermination, normative factors, intentionality, and abnormality. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify the key elements:** Determine the specific outcome in question and the potential causes or actions being considered. Pay close attention to modifiers (e.g., "premature death") that define the exact event being referenced.
2.  **Distinguish Causation from Responsibility:** Remember that identifying a causal factor is different from assigning blame or moral/legal responsibility. An event can be a cause even if the actor was not obligated to prevent it. Do not let considerations of responsibility lead you to deny a genuine causal connection.
3.  **Apply the counterfactual test:** For any potential cause, ask "If this event had not occurred, would the outcome still have happened?"
    *   If the outcome would **not** have occurred without it, then it is a necessary cause.
    *   If the outcome **would** have occurred without it, then it is not a necessary cause.
    *   **Important Caveat:** In cases of **symmetric overdetermination** (two or more sufficient causes occurring simultaneously), the counterfactual test may indicate that no single event was necessary, but this does not automatically mean they are not causes. Proceed to Step 4.
4.  **Consider causal preemption and overdetermination:**
    *   **Preemption:** Even if an event was not necessary because another sufficient cause was present, it can still be considered *a* cause if it was itself a sufficient condition for the outcome and actually occurred.
    *   **Symmetric Overdetermination:** If two or more sufficient events occur at the same time and jointly bring about the outcome, then each event is a cause. The failure of the counterfactual test for an individual event does not negate its causal status in these specific scenarios.
5.  **Evaluate normative context:** If the scenario involves rules, policies, or standard procedures, a violation of the norm is a strong cue for identifying the **primary responsible agent**. However, do not use normative context to deny that an event was *a* cause altogether. An action that breaks a rule is often the salient cause, but another event may still be a causal contributor.
6.  **Evaluate Abnormality:** Determine if any potential cause was abnormal, unexpected, or a deviation from the default course of events. In conjunctive scenarios (where multiple factors are needed), the abnormal factor is often singled out as the primary cause. A highly expected or normal condition is less likely to be labeled *the* cause, even if it is necessary. **Use abnormality to identify the most salient cause, but do not use it to deny that a normal or expected event was still *a* cause.**
7.  **Analyze intentionality separately:** For questions about intent, do not rely solely on the primary goal. If a harmful side-effect was foreseen with certainty and the actor proceeded regardless, then that side-effect is typically judged to have been brought about intentionally.
8.  **Synthesize your reasoning:** Weigh the results of the previous steps.
    *   A cause can be non-necessary but still causally relevant (preemption).
    *   An actor can be a cause without being responsible.
    *   The abnormal or unexpected factor in a chain of events is often judged to be the **primary** or **salient** cause, but it does not erase other causal links.
    *   In symmetric overdetermination, all sufficient simultaneous events are causes.
9.  **Interpret the question wording:** For questions using the word 'because' (e.g., "did Y happen because of X?"), interpret this as "was X a cause of Y?" unless the context strongly implies a search for the sole or primary cause. A 'Yes' answer requires only that X was a causal contributor.
10. **Output your final answer:** Choose between the provided options (Yes/No), ensuring it aligns with the reasoning above.

**Review the following examples to understand common pitfalls and their corrections:**

**Example 1 (Preemption):**
*   **Question:** Did the spinner cause the win?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The dice roll was sufficient, so the spinner did not cause the win. (This ignores that the spinner was a preempted sufficient cause).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The spinner landing on green was a sufficient condition for victory and did occur. Therefore, it is correct to say it was *a* cause, even though it was preempted by the dice roll. Answer: Yes.

**Example 2 (Intentionality):**
*   **Question:** Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** His goal was to win, so harming the bird-watcher was not intentional. (This ignores the principle of intentionality for known side-effects).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The hunter knew the harmful outcome was certain and acted anyway. Therefore, the harmful side-effect is judged to be intentional. Answer: Yes.

**Example 3 (Normative Context & Causation vs. Responsibility):**
*   **Question:** Did Alice cause the email to be sent?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** But for Alice's login, the email would not have been sent, so she caused it. (This ignores the normative context that makes Zoe's action the primary fault).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** Alice's action was a *causal* trigger. However, Zoe's violation of the policy is the *deviant and responsible* cause. In contexts asking for fault or responsibility, we focus on Zoe. For this question, which implies fault, the answer is No.
*   **Answer: No**

**Example 4 (Abnormality):**
*   **Question:** Did the likely green draw cause the win?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The win required both draws, so the green draw was a cause. (This is true but misses the pragmatic use of "cause").
*   **Correct Reasoning:** While the green draw was a necessary condition, it was highly expected and normal. The rare blue draw was the abnormal, surprising factor that actually made the difference. Therefore, the green draw is not considered *the* cause of the win.
*   **Answer: No**

**Example 5 (Causation Without Responsibility):**
*   **Question:** Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Kate was not responsible, so her omission cannot be a cause. (This confuses responsibility with causation).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The counterfactual test shows that if Kate had put oil in the machine, the breakdown would have been prevented. Therefore, her omission was a cause. Her lack of responsibility is relevant for assigning blame, not for denying her causal role.
*   **Answer: Yes**

**Example 6 (Symmetric Overdetermination - NEW):**
*   **Question:** Did Billy cause the bridge to collapse? [Two trains, same time, each sufficient]
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Since Suzy's train alone was sufficient, the bridge would have collapsed without Billy. Therefore, Billy did not cause it. (This misapplies the counterfactual test to a symmetric overdetermination case).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** Both trains entered the bridge simultaneously. The physical cause of the collapse was the total load at that moment, to which both trains contributed. In cases of symmetric overdetermination, all sufficient simultaneous events are causes, even if no single one was necessary. Answer: Yes.

**Example 7 (Proximate vs. Distal Cause - NEW):**
*   **Question:** Did John's job cause his premature death? [Job caused cancer, nurse error caused immediate death]
*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Without the job, John would not have had terminal cancer, so the job caused his death. (This incorrectly applies the counterfactual to the general outcome of "death" rather than the specific event of the "premature death" that occurred yesterday).
*   **Correct Reasoning:** The job caused the terminal illness. However, the specific "premature death" event was directly caused by the nurse's medication error. The job is a distal cause of the fatal condition, but the nurse's error is the proximate cause of the death event itself. For this question about the specific death that occurred, the answer is No.
*   **Answer: No**

Now, answer the following question:
sess the agent's mental state and reasons for acting.
    -   **Identify the Agent's Goal (Primary Intention):** What was the primary outcome the agent wanted to achieve? Why did they perform the action?
    -   **Identify Foreseen Side Effects:** What other outcomes did the agent know would certainly or likely happen?
    -   **Judge Intentionality:** An effect is considered **intentional only if it was part of the agent's goal or plan** (i.e., a reason they acted). An effect that was merely **foreseen but not desired** (the agent was indifferent to it or would have preferred it didn't happen) is **not intentional**.

**Examples of correct reasoning:**

**Example A: (Event Causation)**
**Question:** Joe wins if he gets green from left AND blue from right. He got both. Did getting green cause the win?
**Reasoning:** Type A. Proposed cause: "getting green." Outcome: "win." Counterfactual: If Joe had not gotten green (but still got blue), he would not have won. The outcome would not have occurred.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example B: (Event Causation)**
**Question:** The climate system turns on if travel agents OR design agents arrive. Both arrived. Did design agents cause the system to turn on?
**Reasoning:** Type A. Proposed cause: "design agents arriving." Outcome: "system on." Counterfactual: If design agents had not arrived (but travel agents still did), the system would still have turned on. The outcome would still have occurred.
**Answer:** No

**Example C: (Agent Duty - Permitted Action)**
**Question:** Ned has a new motorboat. It starts if gear is neutral OR motor is in lock. Both are true. Ned did not change the motor's position. Did the boat start because Ned did not change it?
**Reasoning:** Type A. The rule is a system rule, not a norm governing Ned. Proposed cause: "Ned did not change," an *inaction*. Counterfactual: Imagine Ned *had* changed the position. The gear is still neutral. The boat would still start. The outcome would still have occurred.
**Answer:** No

**Example D: (Agent Duty - Prohibited Action)**
**Question:** A hedgehog (forbidden from taking pencils) and a bear (allowed to take pencils) together empty a box of 8 pencils. A polar bear later finds it empty. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
**Reasoning:** Type B. Proposed cause: "the hedgehog taking pencils." Outcome: "no pencils for polar bear." The hedgehog's action violated a rule. Counterfactual: If the hedgehog had followed the rule (taken 0 pencils), the bear would have taken 4. 4 pencils would remain, so the outcome would NOT have occurred. Therefore, the hedgehog's **violation** was a necessary cause.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example E: (Intentionality - Goal)**
**Question:** A hunter shoots a deer, wanting to win a competition. Did the man intentionally shoot the deer?
**Reasoning:** Type C. The agent's goal was to win by killing the deer. Shooting the deer was his intended means to achieve this goal.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example F: (Intentionality - Foreseen but Unintended)**
**Question:** A hunter shoots a deer, knowingly and certainly scaring away a nearby eagle he is indifferent to. Did the man intentionally scare the eagle?
**Reasoning:** Type C. The agent's goal was to kill the deer. The side effect of scaring the eagle was known and certain, but the hunter was indifferent to it. He did not shoot *in order to* scare the eagle. Therefore, scaring the eagle was not intentional.
**Answer:** No

Answer questions about causal attribution and intentionality by applying counterfactual and normative reasoning. Follow these steps carefully and in order:

1. **Identify:** the **proposed cause** (event/action) and the **outcome**.
2. **Establish Default States:** Identify normal, expected, or prescribed states (defaults) and any deviations, interventions, or abnormalities.
   - **Priority Rule:** If there is a conflict, prioritize prescriptive norms (what an agent was told or supposed to do) over descriptive or system-design norms.
   - If unspecified, treat events as equal.
3. **Construct the Counterfactual:** Imagine the proposed cause did **NOT** occur.
   - Hold other *deviant* events fixed.
   - For elements with a default, revert them to that default unless they are the subject of the counterfactual.
4. **Analyze Causal Role:**
   - **A. Necessity Test:** Would the outcome **NOT** have occurred in this counterfactual? If **YES**, the cause is necessary. Proceed to Step 5.
   - **B. Contributory Test:** If the outcome *would* have occurred, ask: **Was the proposed cause a genuine part of the actual, specific set of events that brought about the outcome?** (e.g., was it physically involved, did it help meet a threshold?).
        - If **YES**, it is a contributory cause. Proceed to Step 5.
        - If **NO**, it is not a cause. Answer **"No"**.
   - **C. Overdetermination Test:** Only if the cause was **not part of the actual sufficient set** and the outcome would have occurred via a completely independent, sufficient pathway, is it true overdetermination. Answer **"No"**.
5. **Apply Normative Filtering (For Causation Questions):**
   - **Only** apply this if the question is about causation, not intent.
   - **A. Fulfilling a Duty/Obligation:** Was the agent simply fulfilling a prescribed or expected duty? And was the outcome a **foreseeable consequence of the system's design** when that duty is fulfilled?
        - If **YES**, then causal attribution is often **inappropriate**. Answer **"No"**.
   - **B. Permitted Default Action:** Was the cause a normal, permitted action (a default), and was the outcome an **abnormal, unintended, or malfunctioning** result?
        - If **YES**, then causal attribution is often **inappropriate**. Answer **"No"**.
   - **Otherwise,** answer **"Yes"**.
6. **Evaluate Intentionality (For "Intentionally" Questions):**
   - **Only** apply this if the question contains words like "intentionally" or "on purpose".
   - First, determine if the agent **caused** the outcome (from Steps 4-5). If not, answer **"No"**.
   - If they did cause it, ask: Did the agent **desire** the outcome or **aim** to bring it about as a goal? Merely foreseeing it as a known side effect is not enough.
   - If both conditions are met, answer **"Yes"**; otherwise, answer **"No"**.

**Critical Examples to Guide Reasoning:**

**Example 1 (Redundant Contribution):**
Question: The coffee shop needs only one order to profit. Drew, Kylie, and Oliver (all default customers) ordered. Did Drew's order cause the profit?
- Defaults: All orders are default.
- Counterfactual: Without Drew, Kylie and Oliver still order → profit occurs.
- Analysis: Outcome would still occur, but Drew's order was part of the actual set of events that caused the profit (Step 4B). No normative reason to deny attribution (Step 5).
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Intentionality vs. Causation):**
Question: A sniper pulls the trigger to kill, knowing it will heat the barrel (which he doesn't care about). Did he intentionally heat the barrel?
- He caused the heating (Step 4A: necessary).
- However, he did not desire or aim to heat the barrel; it was a foreseen side effect (Step 6).
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Preemption, Not Overdetermination):**
Question: A bridge collapses the moment both Billy and Suzy's trains (each sufficient alone) enter it simultaneously. Did Billy cause the collapse?
- The collapse was triggered by the *simultaneous* load. Billy's train was part of the actual, specific physical cause (Step 4B).
- It is not overdetermination (Step 4C) because the collapse that occurred depended on both trains being present at that moment.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Normative Filtering - Fulfilling a Duty):**
Question: Suzy and Billy are told by their boss to arrive at 9 am. A motion detector is triggered by more than one person. Both arrive at 9 am, triggering the detector. Did Billy cause the detector to go off?
- **Defaults (Step 2):** The **prescriptive default** from the boss is that **both must be present.** This overrides the detector's design default (one person).
- **Counterfactual (Step 3):** Without Billy, the prescribed state is violated → only Suzy is present → detector does not go off. Billy is necessary (Step 4A).
- **Normative Filtering (Step 5A):** Billy was **fulfilling his duty.** The outcome was the **foreseeable function of the security system** when the duty is fulfilled. Causal attribution is inappropriate.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 (Normative Filtering - Default Action):**
Question: A machine short circuits only if both the default black wire and the deviant red wire touch. Both touch. Did the black wire cause the short circuit?
- **Defaults (Step 2):** Black wire touching is default; red wire touching is deviant.
- **Counterfactual (Step 3):** Remove black wire touch (revert to its default: not touching). Outcome: no short circuit. Black wire is necessary (Step 4A).
- **Normative Filtering (Step 5B):** The cause was a **normal, permitted action.** The outcome was an **abnormal result** triggered by the deviant red wire. Causal attribution is inappropriate.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the context and applying appropriate reasoning. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify the Specific Outcome and Proposed Cause:**
    -   Clearly define the outcome, paying close attention to its exact nature and timing.
    -   Identify the proposed cause (the specific event or omission in question).

2.  **Determine the Causal Question Type:**
    -   **Type A (Necessary Cause):** Is the question asking if the outcome *depended* on the cause? (Keywords: "necessary", "required", "but for", "needed")
    -   **Type B (Salient Cause):** Is the question asking what *actually brought about* the outcome in a narrative context? (Focus on identifying the most explanatory cause using defaults, deviations, and difference-making)
    -   **Type C (Intentional Action):** Is the question asking about the *intent* or *purpose* behind an action? (Keywords: "intentionally", "on purpose", "meant to")

3.  **Apply Reasoning Based on Question Type:**

    **For Type A (Necessary Cause) Questions:**
    -   Construct a counterfactual: imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur, but all else remains similar.
    -   Would the outcome still have occurred *as it actually did*?
        -   If NO, the cause is necessary. Answer "Yes".
        -   If YES, the cause is not necessary. Answer "No".
    -   In overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes present at the same time), no single cause is necessary. Answer "No".

    **For Type B (Salient Cause) Questions:**
    -   **First, check for preemption/overdetermination:**
        -   **Preemption (Asymmetric):** Was there another sufficient cause that would have produced the outcome **earlier** or **independently**, making the proposed cause redundant? If YES, the proposed cause is preempted. Answer "No".
        -   **Symmetric Overdetermination:** Did multiple sufficient causes occur **simultaneously**? (e.g., two switches flipped at the same time). If YES, then **each sufficient cause that actually occurred can be considered a cause**. Answer "Yes" for any of them.
        -   **No Single Sufficient Cause:** Is the outcome caused only by a **combination** of factors? If YES, then proceed to analyze defaults and deviations.
    -   **Second, identify the default process and the deviant event(s):**
        -   Construct the **"default story"**: What would have happened if everything had proceeded as planned, routinely, or expectedly without any unusual interventions or omissions? This is the baseline.
        -   Identify the **"deviant event(s)"**: What specific actions, events, or **omissions** actually **deviated** from this default story and set the new causal chain into motion?
        -   **CRITICAL:** Ignore the moral or procedural value of the action. A deviant event can be good, bad, correct, or incorrect. Focus solely on whether it changed the expected course of events. An action that is "correct" can still be a deviant event if it is a necessary part of a causal chain leading to a bad outcome.
        -   **Pay special attention to omissions (failures to act).** An omission is a deviant event if it violates an expectation or duty to act.
    -   **Third, assess difference-making:** Did the proposed deviant event actually change whether the outcome occurred? If the outcome was already determined by the default process, it's not a difference-maker.
    -   **Final Judgment:** The salient cause is typically the **most recent, direct deviant event** that was a difference-maker for the outcome. If the proposed cause is not this primary deviant event, answer "No". In cases of symmetric overdetermination, answer "Yes".

    **For Type C (Intentional Action) Questions:**
    -   Focus on mental state, not physical causation.
    -   Did the agent have a desire for the outcome?
    -   Did the agent perform the action deliberately and knowingly to achieve the outcome?
    -   If the action was accidental (e.g., slip, mistake, unintended side effect) even if it caused the outcome, answer "No".

**Critical Examples to Avoid Common Errors:**

**Example 1 (Defaults & Deviations - Moral Action):**
Question: Joe was about to go pick up his child from school. In the parking lot, he stopped to help a person who was injured. Because of this delay, his neighbor took the child home. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver, injuring the child. Did Joe cause his son's injury?
Reasoning: Type B.
-   Default Story: Joe picks up his son on time and drives him home safely.
-   Deviant Events: 1) Joe helps an injured person (deviates from the default). 2) A drunk driver strikes the car (a further, more direct deviant event).
-   Preemption: The drunk driver's action is a sufficient cause of the accident.
-   Difference-Making: Joe's action made a difference, but the **most recent and direct deviant event** is the drunk driver's abnormal action. Joe's action is not the salient cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 2 (Preemption):**
Question: System turns on if Travel OR Design agents arrive. Both arrived. Did Design cause it?
Reasoning: Type B. Travel's arrival was sufficient and would have caused the outcome regardless. Design's arrival was preempted.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Symmetric Overdetermination - REVISED):**
Question: Two switches, Switch A and Switch B, both control the same light. The light is on if either switch is on. Both Ben and Alice independently flip their respective switches (A and B) to the "on" position at exactly the same moment. The light turns on. Did flipping Switch A cause the light to turn on?
Reasoning: Type B.
-   Preemption/Overdetermination: Both actions are sufficient and occurred simultaneously. This is symmetric overdetermination.
-   Therefore, each action is a cause. The outcome would not have occurred *as it did* without the actual flipping of Switch A (it was part of the set of actual sufficient causes).
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Omissions & "Correct" Actions - NEW):**
Question: Tom instructs Alex to use only fertilizer A and to tell Benni. Alex uses A correctly but forgets to tell Benni. Benni, unaware, uses fertilizer B. Plants dry up only where both A and B are applied. Did Alex cause the plants to dry out?
Reasoning: Type B.
-   Default Story: Alex tells Benni, both use A, plants are healthy.
-   Deviant Events: 1) Alex's **omission** (failure to tell Benni). 2) Benni's use of B.
-   Preemption: None. The damage requires the combination.
-   Difference-Making: Alex's omission was the primary deviation. But for his failure, Benni would have used A, and the damaging combination would not have occurred. His use of A was part of the necessary combination.
-   The salient cause is Alex's omission, which is attributed to Alex. Therefore, Alex caused the damage.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 5 (Intent):**
Question: Did Jake shoot his aunt intentionally?
Reasoning: Type C. Although Jake desired the outcome, his hand slipped making the shot accidental.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 6 (Necessity):**
Question: (John's death context) Given his cancer, was the medication necessary for his death?
Reasoning: Type A. Counterfactual: Without medication, he would have died from cancer soon. Not necessary.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Remember:** Identifying a salient cause is a judgment about narrative explanation and does not necessarily imply moral blame or legal fault.

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying counterfactual reasoning. Follow these steps carefully:

**0.  Classify the Question Type:**
    -   **Type A: Event Causation:** Questions asking if an **event or state** was a necessary cause of an outcome (e.g., "Did the flood cause the collapse?"). *Proceed to Step 1.*
    -   **Type B: Agent Duty & Norms:** Questions asking if an *agent's action/inaction* caused an outcome **AND the context involves explicit or strong implicit rules, laws, duties, social norms, or permissions/prohibitions applied specifically to the agent's behavior** (e.g., "Did the student violate a rule and cause the problem?"). *Proceed to Step 1, then apply Step 8.*
    -   **Type C: Intentionality Attribution:** Questions asking if an agent *intentionally* performed an action or brought about an outcome (e.g., "Did the man intentionally shoot?"). *Skip to Step 9.*

**1.  Identify the proposed cause and the outcome.**
    -   Pay close attention to how the cause is phrased. If it is a negative event or an inaction (e.g., "did not change," "was absent"), the counterfactual will involve its positive counterpart (e.g., "did change," "was present").
    -   Separate an *agent's action or inaction* from the resulting *state of the world*.

**2.  Construct a counterfactual scenario:** Imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur (or, for an inaction, imagine the agent DID perform the action), but all other conditions remain as similar as possible to the original situation.

**3.  Determine if the outcome would still have occurred in this counterfactual scenario:**
    -   If the outcome would NOT have occurred, then the proposed cause is a necessary factor. *Proceed to Step 7.5.*
    -   If the outcome would still have occurred, then the proposed cause is not necessary. Answer "No".

**4.  For events requiring multiple conditions (e.g., A AND B must occur),** remember that EACH condition is necessary. The absence of any necessary condition prevents the outcome.

**5.  Ignore the likelihood or probability of events.** Focus only on the dependency revealed by the counterfactual scenario.

**6.  In cases of overdetermination (where multiple sufficient causes exist),** the outcome does not depend on any single cause. If the outcome would have occurred even without the proposed cause, answer "No".

**7.  Special Rule for Omissions:** For a cause phrased as an inaction (e.g., "did not do X"), the counterfactual is that the agent *does* perform the action. If performing that action would have changed the outcome, then the inaction was necessary. *Proceed to Step 7.5.* If the outcome would have been the same regardless, then the inaction was not necessary. Answer "No".

**7.5. Normative Filter for Causal Attribution:**
    -   **Apply this step ONLY if the counterfactual test (Step 3/7) indicates the proposed cause was necessary ("Yes"), BUT the context strongly emphasizes that it was a *normal*, *praiseworthy*, or *innocuous* action/inaction, and the actual harm was caused by a separate, *deviant* agent or event (e.g., a drunk driver, a criminal act, a malfunction).**
    -   In such cases, human judgment often **denies causal attribution** to the normal action, treating it as a background condition, and assigns salience to the deviant cause.
    -   If this applies, the final answer is "No".

**8.  For Agent Duty & Norms (Type B):**
    -   **CRITICAL: This step is for social, legal, moral, or strong implicit normative contexts governing the agent. For purely mechanical system rules (e.g., "the system turns on if A OR B"), treat as Type A, but consider if the rule is presented as a norm the agent *should* follow.**
    -   Identify any explicit or implicit rules, laws, or norms governing the agent's actions.
    -   A **permitted action or inaction** is typically considered a background condition, not a salient cause.
    -   A **prohibited action or a violation of a duty** is typically considered a salient cause of the outcome.
    -   **Re-evaluate the Counterfactual:** The key question is, "What if the agent had followed the rules?" If the outcome would not have occurred, then their violation was a cause. *Proceed to Step 7.5 if applicable.*

**9.  For Intentionality Attribution (Type C):**
    -   **Do not use counterfactual causality.** Instead, assess the agent's mental state and reasons for acting.
    -   **Identify the Agent's Goal (Primary Intention):** What was the primary outcome the agent wanted to achieve? Why did they perform the action?
    -   **Identify Foreseen Side Effects:** What other outcomes did the agent know would certainly or likely happen?
    -   **Judge Intentionality (Standard Test):** An effect is considered **intentional only if it was part of the agent's goal or plan** (i.e., a reason they acted). An effect that was merely **foreseen but not desired** is typically **not intentional**.
    -   **!! SPECIAL CASE: Harmful Side Effects !!** If the side effect is **clearly harmful or bad** (e.g., injuring someone, breaking something, polluting) and the agent knew it was certain or highly likely, then people often judge it as **intentional even if the agent was indifferent or did not desire it**. In this case, answer "Yes".

**Examples of correct reasoning:**

**Example A: (Event Causation)**
**Question:** Joe wins if he gets green from left AND blue from right. He got both. Did getting green cause the win?
**Reasoning:** Type A. Proposed cause: "getting green." Outcome: "win." Counterfactual: If Joe had not gotten green (but still got blue), he would not have won. The outcome would not have occurred.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example B: (Event Causation)**
**Question:** The climate system turns on if travel agents OR design agents arrive. Both arrived. Did design agents cause the system to turn on?
**Reasoning:** Type A. Proposed cause: "design agents arriving." Outcome: "system on." Counterfactual: If design agents had not arrived (but travel agents still did), the system would still have turned on. The outcome would still have occurred.
**Answer:** No

**Example C: (Agent Duty - Permitted Inaction)**
**Question:** Ned has a new motorboat. It starts if gear is neutral OR motor is in lock. Both are true. Ned did not change the motor's position. Did the boat start because Ned did not change it?
**Reasoning:** Type A. The rule is a system rule, not a norm governing Ned. Proposed cause: "Ned did not change," an *inaction*. Counterfactual: Imagine Ned *had* changed the position. The gear is still neutral. The boat would still start. The outcome would still have occurred.
**Answer:** No

**Example D: (Agent Duty - Prohibited Action)**
**Question:** A hedgehog (forbidden from taking pencils) and a bear (allowed to take pencils) together empty a box of 8 pencils. A polar bear later finds it empty. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
**Reasoning:** Type B. Proposed cause: "the hedgehog taking pencils." Outcome: "no pencils for polar bear." The hedgehog's action violated a rule. Counterfactual: If the hedgehog had followed the rule (taken 0 pencils), the bear would have taken 4. 4 pencils would remain, so the outcome would NOT have occurred. Therefore, the hedgehog’s **violation** was a necessary cause.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example E: (Intentionality - Goal)**
**Question:** A hunter shoots a deer, wanting to win a competition. Did the man intentionally shoot the deer?
**Reasoning:** Type C. The agent's goal was to win by killing the deer. Shooting the deer was his intended means to achieve this goal.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example F: (Intentionality - Foreseen & Harmful)**
**Question:** A hunter shoots a deer, knowingly and certainly scaring away a nearby eagle he is indifferent to. Did the man intentionally scare the eagle?
**Reasoning:** Type C. The agent's goal was to kill the deer. The side effect of scaring the eagle was known and certain, but it is not clearly harmful (the eagle is just scared away). The hunter was indifferent. He did not shoot *in order to* scare the eagle. Therefore, scaring the eagle was not intentional.
**Answer:** No

**Example G: (Intentionality - Foreseen & Harmful) [Addresses Failure Case 1]**
**Question:** A sniper shoots an enemy commander, knowingly and certainly heating the gun barrel, which is a harmful state (wear and tear on the weapon). He is indifferent. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel?
**Reasoning:** Type C. The agent's goal was to kill the commander. Heating the barrel was a known, certain, and harmful side effect (damages the equipment). Applying the Special Case for harmful side effects, this is judged as intentional.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example H: (Normative Filter) [Addresses Failure Case 3]**
**Question:** Generous Joe stops to help an injured person, causing a delay that leads to his son being injured by a drunk driver in a neighbor's car. Joe's generosity is a fixed, praiseworthy trait. Did Joe cause his son's injury?
**Reasoning:** Type A. Proposed cause: "Joe stopping to help." Outcome: "son's injury." Counterfactual: If Joe had not stopped, the neighbor would not have driven, and the injury would not have occurred. The action was necessary. HOWEVER, apply Step 7.5: The cause (helping) is normal and praiseworthy for Joe, and the direct harm was caused by a deviant agent (drunk driver). The normative filter applies. Causal attribution is denied to Joe.
**Answer:** No

Answer questions about causal attribution by identifying the pivotal, agential action that made the critical difference in the outcome. Focus on the event that was decisive in the actual causal chain, rather than routine or automatic necessary conditions.

**Apply this two-step reasoning process:**

1.  **But-For Test:** Was the outcome dependent on this event? ("But for this event, would the outcome have occurred in the exact way it did?")
2.  **Pivotal Action Test:** Was this event the **decisive factor** that changed the expected course of events? Did it involve a meaningful choice, a deviation from normal procedure, or a non-guaranteed action? If the event was a routine, automatic, or procedurally guaranteed step, it is likely a background condition and not a cause.

**Key Principles to Follow:**
-   **Prioritize Proximate Agency:** The cause is typically the most immediate intentional act that made the critical difference.
-   **Narrative Salience:** Accept the story's facts, and use its framing to identify the salient, non-standard event. The story often emphasizes the pivotal choice.
-   **Avoid Trivial Necessity:** Do not classify routine or guaranteed steps (e.g., a required signature that is automatically given) as causes. These are background conditions.
-   **Preemption vs. Joint Necessity:** In cases of preemption, the preempting cause is the actual cause. For jointly necessary events, identify which one was the active, pivotal decision-maker.
-   **Overdetermination:** An event is a cause if it was sufficient on its own to bring about the outcome, even if other sufficient causes were present.

**Examples for Guidance:**

**Example where answer is Yes (Pivotal Action):**
Question: A doctor's signature was required but against policy. The drug was administered and caused recovery. Did the doctor's decision cause the recovery?
Reasoning: The doctor's decision was the pivotal difference-maker. It was a discretionary choice that violated policy, changing the expected outcome. It passes both the but-for test (without it, no drug) and the pivotal action test (it was non-routine and decisive).
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example where answer is No (Background Condition):**
Question: An intern needed two signatures. The pharmacist automatically signed after confirming stock. The doctor signed despite policy against it. The drug was administered and caused recovery. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the recovery?
Reasoning: The pharmacist's action was a necessary condition but it was routine and automatic. It fails the pivotal action test. The decisive, non-guaranteed event was the doctor's choice to sign against policy. The pharmacist's action is a background condition.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example where answer is Yes (Overdetermination):**
Question: Drew, Kylie, and Oliver all ordered coffee. The shop profits if at least one orders. Did Drew's order cause the profit?
Reasoning: Drew's order was sufficient on its own to cause the profit (overdetermination). It was part of the actual set of events and passes the pivotal action test as a deliberate, non-guaranteed customer choice.

Answer questions about causal attribution by focusing on actual causation. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Define the Specific Outcome:** First, carefully identify the exact outcome (the effect) described in the question. Pay close attention to all modifiers (e.g., "premature," "yesterday," "the problem") as they define the specific event in question. The outcome is not a general type of event but the specific instance as described.
2.  **Apply the Difference-Maker Test:** Determine if the candidate event was a necessary OR sufficient part of the set of events that actually brought about **that specific outcome**. Ask: "Was this event pivotal in making **this exact outcome** happen in the precise way it did in this scenario?"
3.  **Handle Preemption and Overdetermination:**
    *   For preemption: If the event was necessary in the actual chain to trigger the outcome, it is a cause.
    *   For overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes): An event is still a cause if it was part of the actual causal set. However, if the outcome would have occurred at the exact same time and in the exact same manner without the event, then it is not a cause of *that specific instance* of the outcome.
4.  **Accept All Premises:** Accept the narrative's factual premises without skepticism (e.g., take stated causal links as given). Crucially, also accept the narrative's **normative premises** (e.g., rules, permissions, intentions). If a rule or norm is stated, factor it into your analysis of causation, especially for outcomes like "the problem."
5.  **Avoid External Skepticism:** Do not introduce external biological, physical, or philosophical doubts. Your analysis must stay within the world described.

**Examples for Guidance:**

**Example (Correct - Overdetermination):**
Question: Drew, Kylie, and Oliver all ordered coffee. The shop profits if at least one orders. Did Drew's order cause the profit?
Reasoning: The specific outcome is "the shop profiting." Drew's order was sufficient and part of the actual set of events that caused the profit. Even though not necessary (others ordered), it was still a cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example (Correct - Preemption):**
Question: A doctor's signature was required but against policy. The drug was administered and caused recovery. Did the doctor's decision cause the recovery?
Reasoning: The specific outcome is "the recovery." The doctor's decision was the pivotal difference-maker in the actual chain. Without it, the drug would not have been administered.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example (New - Effect Specificity):**
Question: A patient was terminally ill and had 1 hour to live. A visitor accidentally tripped on a cord, unplugging the life-support machine, causing immediate death. Did the visitor cause the death?
Reasoning: The specific outcome is "immediate death at that moment from the unplugging." The terminal illness was sufficient for death in one hour, but it was not sufficient for death *at that exact moment*. The visitor's action was the pivotal, necessary event for that specific outcome.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example (New - Normative Context):**
Question: A security guard is hired to prevent theft. He deliberately leaves a door unlocked. A thief uses the unlocked door to steal a painting. Did the guard cause the theft?
Reasoning: The outcome is "the theft." The guard's action (leaving the door unlocked) was a necessary part of the actual causal chain for this theft. Furthermore, he violated his duty, which is key context for his causal role.

Answer questions about causal attribution by focusing on actual causation. Determine if the event was a necessary OR sufficient part of the set of events that actually brought about the outcome. Apply the "difference-maker" test: ask if the event was pivotal in making the outcome happen in the specific scenario described. For this test, construct the counterfactual by changing only the target event and holding all other established facts and narrative constraints fixed.

**Key Principles for Application:**
- **Hold Narrative Facts Fixed:** In your counterfactual reasoning, do not alter other events, dispositions, or background conditions stated in the narrative. Only change the specific event in question.
- **Preemption:** An event is a cause if it was necessary to activate the actual causal chain that occurred (it preempted an alternative chain).
- **Asymmetric Overdetermination (e.g., multiple sufficient causes):** An event can be a cause if it was part of the actual causal set that brought about the outcome, even if it was not strictly necessary.
- **Symmetric Overdetermination (e.g., two identical sufficient causes):** In these specific cases, if the outcome would have occurred unchanged due to another identical, sufficient event even without the target event, then the target event is not a cause. The outcome is attributed to the collective set.
- **Omissions/Double Prevention:** Treat omissions (failures to act) as potential causes if they were pivotal in allowing the actual causal chain to proceed, based on the narrative's expectations.

Accept the narrative's premises without skepticism (e.g., if the story states an action led to an outcome, take it as given). Avoid ethical judgments or external skepticism; focus solely on the described causal chain.

**Examples for guidance:**

**Example 1 (Answer: Yes - Asymmetric Overdetermination):**
Question: Drew, Kylie, and Oliver all ordered coffee. The shop profits if at least one orders. Did Drew's order cause the profit?
Reasoning: Drew's order was sufficient and part of the actual set of events that caused the profit. Even though not necessary (others ordered), it was still a cause.
Answer: Yes

**Example 2 (Answer: Yes - Preemption):**
Question: A doctor's signature was required but against policy. The drug was administered and caused recovery. Did the doctor's decision cause the recovery?
Reasoning: The doctor's decision was the pivotal difference-maker. Without it, the drug would not have been administered. It was necessary in the actual chain of events.
Answer: Yes

**Example 3 (Answer: No - Symmetric Overdetermination):**
Question: Two rocks, Rock A and Rock B, are thrown simultaneously at a window. Either rock alone has enough force to break the window. The window breaks. Did Rock A cause the window to break?
Reasoning: This is symmetric overdetermination. The window breaking was guaranteed by Rock B alone. If Rock A had not been thrown, the outcome would have been identical (the window would still be broken by Rock B). Rock A's throw was not a difference-maker.
Answer: No

**Example 4 (Answer: Yes - Omission with Narrative Constraints):**
Question: Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Reasoning: The narrative establishes that Wayne's only available action was to change the device's position. Holding narrative facts fixed, the direct counterfactual is that if he had acted, he would have moved the device off the pad. The device charges if it is EITHER plugged in OR on the pad. In the actual world, both conditions are met (Plugged AND On Pad). His inaction preserved the "on the pad" condition. If he had acted, he would have removed this condition, leaving only "plugged in." Since either condition is sufficient, the device would have charged anyway. However, his inaction was part of the actual sufficient set (P ∧ OP) that brought about the outcome. It was a cause.

Answer questions about causal attribution by identifying the pivotal, agential action (or deliberate omission) that made the critical difference in the outcome. Focus on the event that was decisive in the actual causal chain, rather than routine or automatic necessary conditions.

**Apply this two-step reasoning process:**

1.  **But-For Test:** Was the outcome dependent on this event in the actual world? ("In the specific way the events unfolded, was this a necessary link in the chain?")
2.  **Pivotal Action Test:** Was this event the **decisive factor** that changed or ensured the expected course of events? Did it involve a meaningful choice, a deviation from normal procedure, a non-guaranteed action, or a deliberate decision to *preserve* a state of affairs? If the event was a routine, automatic, or procedurally guaranteed step with no agentive discretion, it is likely a background condition and not a cause.

**Key Principles to Follow:**
-   **Prioritize Proximate Agency:** The cause is typically the most immediate intentional act (or intentional omission) that made the critical difference.
-   **Narrative Salience:** Accept the story's facts and use its framing to identify the salient, non-standard event. The story often emphasizes the pivotal choice or moment of decision.

-   **Overdetermination:** An event is a cause if it was sufficient on its own to bring about the outcome and was part of the actual set of events, even if other sufficient causes were present.
-   **Causation by Omission & Preservation:** An omission (not acting) can be a cause if the agent **considered acting, had the capacity to act, and made a deliberate choice not to intervene.** A key test is whether the agent's inaction **preserved** or **ensured** that a sufficient condition remained in place. Distinguish between a **background guarantee** (the outcome would happen without any agent involvement) and an **agent-ensured outcome** (the outcome happened because an agent acted, or refrained from acting, to 'lock it in').

**Example where answer is Yes (Causation by Preservation - addresses previous failure):**
Question: David has a new dryer. His clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, both conditions are already met. David checks the dryer's settings, sees the temperature is set on HIGH, does not change it, and turns on the dryer. The clothes dry in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David did not change the temperature setting?
Reasoning: David's inaction is not a background condition. He actively checked the setting, gained knowledge, and made a deliberate choice *to preserve* the sufficient condition (HIGH temperature). His decision ensured the status quo remained. But-for his deliberate preservation, the setting might have been different (e.g., if he hadn't checked and someone else had changed it). This passes the pivotal action test as a meaningful, non-guaranteed choice to ensure the outcome.

- **Defaults and Deviations:** If the narrative establishes a normal, expected, or prescribed course of action (a default), and a specific event is a deviation from it, causal attribution often falls on the deviant event. When testing a normal event, consider a counterfactual where the deviation does not occur.

Accept the narrative's premises without skepticism (e.g., if the story states an action led to an outcome, take it as given). Avoid ethical judgments or external skepticism; focus solely on the described causal chain.

Question: Two rocks, Rock A and Rock B, are thrown simultaneously at a window. Either rock alone has enough force to break the window. The window breaks. Did Rock A cause the window to break?
Reasoning: This is symmetric overdetermination. The window breaking was guaranteed by Rock B alone. If Rock A had not been thrown, the outcome would have been identical (the window would still be broken by Rock B). Rock A's throw was not a difference-maker.
Answer: No

Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Reasoning: The narrative establishes that Wayne's only available action was to change the device's position. Holding narrative facts fixed, the direct counterfactual is that if he had acted, he would have moved the device off the pad. The device charges if it is EITHER plugged in OR on the pad.

Since either condition is sufficient, the device would have charged anyway. However, his inaction was part of the actual sufficient set (P ∧ OP) that brought about the outcome. It was a cause.
Answer: Yes

**Example 5 (Answer: No - Deviation Principle):**
Question: Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Jane logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Lauren decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately. Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
Reasoning: The narrative establishes a policy as a key background condition, creating a default (Jane uses mornings) and a deviation (Lauren's login). Jane's action was the expected, normal behavior. To test if Jane's action caused the crash, we must consider a counterfactual consistent with the default policy: if Jane had not logged on, the policy would have been violated in a different way (by her absence), but Lauren's deviant login might not be assumed to still occur, as it is the primary violation. The more appropriate counterfactual holds the policy fixed and removes the deviation: if Lauren had not deviated and logged on, only Jane would be logged in, and the crash would not have occurred. Therefore, Jane's normal action was not the difference-maker; Lauren's deviant action was.

Answer questions about causal attribution by focusing on actual causation. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Define the Specific Outcome:** Identify the exact outcome (the effect) described in the question. Pay close attention to all modifiers (e.g., "premature," "yesterday," "the problem") as they define the specific event in question. The outcome is not a general type of event but the specific instance as described.

2.  **Apply the Normative Counterfactual Test:** Determine if the candidate event was a difference-maker for **that specific outcome** by asking:
    > "Holding all normal, default, or expected background conditions constant, if the candidate event had been different (e.g., an action was not taken, or a different choice was made), would the specific outcome have occurred **in the exact same way and at the exact same time**?"

    *   **Incorporate Norms to Define "Normal":** Use stated rules, duties, and expectations to define the "default" course of events. An **omission** is only a potential cause if it violated a duty or norm to act. If an agent had no responsibility, their inaction is the default state and is not a cause.
    *   **Key Principle:** The cause is the deviation from the expected, normal course of events that made the difference for the specific outcome.

3.  **Handle Preemption and Asymmetry:**
    *   **Preemption:** If the event was necessary in the actual chain to trigger the outcome, it is a cause.
    *   **Symmetrical Overdetermination:** If the outcome would have occurred at the exact same time and in the exact same manner without the event, then it is not a cause.
    *   **Asymmetrical Cases (Probabilities):** If context (like probability) is provided, the event that was least likely or that deviated from the expected course is typically the primary cause for explanatory purposes. A high-probability, expected event is often not considered the cause, even if logically necessary.

4.  **Accept All Premises, Distinguish Causation from Intentionality:**
    *   Accept the narrative's factual and normative premises without skepticism.
    *   **Crucial:** This framework answers "Did X cause Y?". It is **not** designed for questions about mental states like "intentionally," "knowingly," or "purposefully." For those, a different analysis of the agent's goals is required. Causing an outcome is not sufficient for having done it intentionally.

5.  **Avoid External Skepticism:** Do not introduce external biological, physical, or philosophical doubts. Your analysis must stay within the world described.

**Examples for Guidance:**

**Example (Correct - Omission & Norms):**
Question: Janet (responsible) forgot to oil a machine. Kate (not responsible) also did not oil it. The machine broke down. Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?
Reasoning: The specific outcome is "the machine breaking down." Kate had no duty to act; her inaction was the norm. The counterfactual is: If Kate *had* acted (deviating from the norm), would the breakdown have occurred at that time? It would likely have been prevented. However, since she had no duty, we do not consider this deviation. The cause is Janet's omission, which was a deviation from *her* duty.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example (Correct - Asymmetry & Probability):**
Question: Joe likely gets a green ball from left box and very unlikely gets a blue ball from right box. He gets both and wins. Did the first choice (green ball) cause the win?
Reasoning: The outcome is "winning a dollar." The first choice (green ball) was highly probable and part of the expected scenario (which was to lose, due to the unlikely second draw). The second choice (blue ball) was the abnormal, unexpected event that made the difference between the expected outcome (loss) and the actual outcome (win). Therefore, the first choice is not the cause for explanatory purposes.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example (Correct - Causation vs. Intentionality):**
Question: A sniper kills a target, knowingly disturbing air molecules. Did he intentionally disturb them?
Reasoning: This question is about intentionality, not just causation. The sniper's goal was to kill. The disturbance was a foreseen but undesired side effect. He did not act *with the intention of* disturbing air molecules; he acted with the intention of killing. Therefore, he caused it but did not do it intentionally.

Answer questions about causal and intentional attribution by first classifying the question type, then applying the appropriate reasoning process.

**Step 0: Classify the Question**
-   **If the question asks "Did X cause Y?" or "Was Y because of X?"** → Proceed to the **Causal Attribution Process**.
-   **If the question asks "Did X *intentionally* cause Y?" or "Did X mean to cause Y?"** → Proceed to the **Intentionality Attribution Process**.

---

### **Causal Attribution Process**

Identify the pivotal, agential action (or deliberate omission) that made the critical difference in the outcome. Focus on the event that was decisive in the actual causal chain, rather than routine or automatic necessary conditions.

**Apply this two-step reasoning process:**

1.  **But-For Test:** Was the outcome dependent on this event in the actual world? ("In the specific way the events unfolded, was this a necessary link in the chain?")
2.  **Pivotal Action Test:** Was this event the **decisive factor** that changed or ensured the expected course of events? Did it involve a meaningful choice, a deviation from normal procedure, a non-guaranteed action, or a deliberate decision to *preserve* a state of affairs? If the event was a routine, automatic, or procedurally guaranteed step with no agentive discretion, it is likely a background condition and not a cause.

**Key Principles to Follow:**
-   **Prioritize Proximate Agency:** The cause is typically the most immediate intentional act (or intentional omission) that made the critical difference.
-   **Narrative Salience:** Accept the story's facts and use its framing to identify the salient, non-standard event. The story often emphasizes the pivotal choice or moment of decision.
-   **Avoid Trivial Necessity:** Do not classify routine or guaranteed steps (e.g., a required signature that is automatically given) as causes. These are background conditions.
-   **Preemption vs. Joint Necessity:** In cases of preemption, the preempting cause is the actual cause. For jointly necessary events, identify which one was the active, pivotal decision-maker.
-   **Overdetermination:** An event is a cause if it was sufficient on its own to bring about the outcome and was part of the actual set of events, even if other sufficient causes were present.
-   **Causation by Omission & Preservation:** An omission (not acting) can be a cause if the agent **considered acting, had the capacity to act, and made a deliberate choice not to intervene.** A key test is whether the agent's inaction **preserved** or **ensured** that a sufficient condition remained in place. Distinguish between a **background guarantee** (the outcome would happen without any agent involvement) and an **agent-ensured outcome** (the outcome happened because an agent acted, or refrained from acting, to 'lock it in').

---

### **Intentionality Attribution Process**

Determine if an agent brought about an outcome intentionally. An effect can be intentional even if it is not the primary goal.

**Apply this three-condition test:**

1.  **Belief:** Did the agent believe their action (or omission) would bring about the outcome? (It was a known or foreseen consequence).
2.  **Desire/Indifference:** Did the agent desire the outcome, or were they merely indifferent to it? (If they desired to *avoid* it, they did not cause it intentionally).
3.  **Action:** Did the agent perform the action that was the cause of the outcome? (You may briefly verify this using the Causal Attribution principles above).

**Key Principles to Follow:**
-   **Side Effects are Intentional under Indifference:** If an agent knows their action will cause an outcome, is indifferent to it (does not care if it happens), and performs the action anyway, they have intentionally caused that outcome.
-   **Distinguish Goal from Intention:** The outcome need not be the primary goal or purpose of the action to be intentional. It can be a known and accepted (or indifferent) side effect.
-   **Regret Implies Lack of Desire:** If an agent regrets an outcome or sees it as an unfortunate cost, they did not desire it and therefore did not cause it intentionally, even if they foresaw it.

### **Examples for Guidance**

**Causal Example: Yes (Pivotal Action)**
Question: A doctor's signature was required but against policy. The drug was administered and caused recovery. Did the doctor's decision cause the recovery?
Reasoning: (Causal) The doctor’s decision was the pivotal difference-maker. It was a discretionary choice that violated policy. It passes both the but-for and pivotal action tests.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Causal Example: No (Background Condition)**
Question: An intern needed two signatures. The pharmacist automatically signed after confirming stock. The doctor signed despite policy against it. The drug was administered and caused recovery. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the recovery?
Reasoning: (Causal) The pharmacist's action was a necessary but routine and automatic condition. It fails the pivotal action test. The doctor's choice was the decisive event.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Intentionality Example: Yes (Intentional Side Effect)**
Question: A sniper pulls the trigger to kill a commander, knowing it will certainly heat the gun barrel. He doesn't care if the barrel gets hot. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel?
Reasoning: (Intentionality)
1.  **Belief:** Yes, he knew firing would heat the barrel.
2.  **Desire/Indifference:** He was indifferent to the outcome.
3.  **Action:** He performed the action that caused the heating.
The heating was a foreseen side effect to which he was indifferent. Therefore, he intentionally heated the barrel.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Intentionality Example: No (Unintentional Side Effect)**
Question: A surgeon operates to save a patient's life. She knows the surgery will cause a large scar, which she regrets is necessary. Did the surgeon intentionally cause the scar?
Reasoning: (Intentionality)
1.  **Belief:** Yes, she knew the surgery would cause the scar.
2.  **Desire/Indifference:** She regretted the scar; she did not desire it.
3.  **Action:** She performed the action.
Because she regretted the outcome (a negative desire), she did not cause it intentionally.

2025-09-09 19:29:20,344 - 📊 Current Prompt:
Answer questions about causal attribution by focusing on actual causation. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Define the Specific Outcome:** Identify the exact outcome (the effect) described in the question. Pay close attention to all modifiers (e.g., "premature," "yesterday," "the problem") as they define the specific event in question. The outcome is not a general type of event but the specific instance as described.

2.  **Apply the Actual Causation Test:** Determine if the candidate event was part of the set of actual events that brought about the outcome. For this, apply a two-part analysis:
    *   **But-For Necessity (Minimal Test):** Ask: "If the candidate event had been different (e.g., an action was not taken, or a different choice was made), would the specific outcome have occurred **in the exact same way and at the exact same time**?" If the answer is no, then the event is an actual cause.
    *   **Normative Salience (Explanatory Focus):** Use stated rules, duties, and expectations to define the "default" course of events. The primary cause for explanatory purposes is often the **deviation from this expected norm**. An **omission** is a salient cause **only if it violated a duty or norm to act**. If an agent had no responsibility, their inaction is the default state and is typically not the *salient* cause, even if it was a but-for cause.

3.  **Handle Preemption and Overdetermination:**
    *   **Preemption:** If the event was necessary in the actual chain to trigger the outcome, it is a cause.
    *   **Symmetrical Overdetermination:** If multiple sufficient events occurred, **all of them are actual causes** of the outcome. The but-for test fails here, so rely on the fact that each event was part of the actual sufficient set. For explanatory purposes, the most salient cause is the one that deviated from the norm.
    *   **Asymmetrical Cases (Probabilities):** If context (like probability) is provided, the event that was least likely or that deviated from the expected course is typically the primary cause for explanatory purposes.

4.  **Resolve Ambiguity Based on Question Phrasing:** If the question is neutral ("Did X cause Y?"), prioritize **actual causation** (the but-for test or membership in the actual sufficient set). If the question implies blame, responsibility, or explanation ("What was the cause?"), prioritize **normative salience**.

5.  **Accept All Premises, Distinguish Causation from Intentionality:**
    *   Accept the narrative's factual and normative premises without skepticism.
    *   **Crucial:** This framework answers "Did X cause Y?". It is **not** designed for questions about mental states like "intentionally," "knowingly," or "purposefully." For those, a different analysis of the agent's goals is required. Causing an outcome is not sufficient for having done it intentionally.

6.  **Avoid External Skepticism:** Do not introduce external biological, physical, or philosophical doubts. Your analysis must stay within the world described.

**Examples for Guidance:**

**Example (Correct - Omission & Norms):**
Question: Janet (responsible) forgot to oil a machine. Kate (not responsible) also did not oil it. The machine broke down. Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?
Reasoning: The specific outcome is "the machine breaking down." Kate had no duty to act; her inaction was the norm. While her omission was a but-for cause (if she had acted, the breakdown might have been prevented), it is not the salient cause. The cause is Janet's omission, which was a deviation from *her* duty.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example (Correct - Symmetrical Overdetermination):**
Question: Drew, Kylie, and Oliver all ordered coffee. The shop profits if at least one orders. Did Drew’s order cause the profit?
Reasoning: The outcome is "the shop profiting." Drew's order was part of the actual set of sufficient events. The but-for test fails (without Drew, profit still occurs), but for actual causation, we consider all events in the sufficient set as causes. The question is neutral, so we answer yes.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example (Correct - Asymmetry & Probability):**
Question: Joe likely gets a green ball from left box and very unlikely gets a blue ball from right box. He gets both and wins. Did the first choice (green ball) cause the win?
Reasoning: The outcome is "winning a dollar." The first choice (green ball) was highly probable and part of the expected scenario. The second choice (blue ball) was the abnormal, unexpected event that made the difference between the expected outcome (loss) and the actual outcome (win). Therefore, the first choice is an actual cause but not the salient cause for explanatory purposes.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example (New - Omission without Duty, Neutral Question):**
Question: A lifeguard (duty to save) and a passerby (no duty) both see a child drowning. Neither acts. The child drowns. Did the passerby not acting cause the drowning?
Reasoning: The specific outcome is "the child drowning." The passerby had no duty; their inaction is the norm. However, the question is phrased neutrally. Applying the but-for test: if the passerby *had* acted, the child would have been saved. Therefore, their omission was a necessary part of the actual causal chain and is an actual cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example (New - Preemption):**
Question: Assassin A poisons a water bottle. Assassin B later empties the same bottle, unaware of the poison. The target dies of thirst. Did Assassin A's poisoning cause the death?
Reasoning: The specific outcome is "death by thirst." Assassin A's action was preempted by B's. The but-for test: if A had not poisoned the bottle, B would still have emptied it, and the target would still have died of thirst at the same time. Therefore, A's action was not an actual cause of *this specific outcome*.

Answer questions about causal attribution by focusing on actual causation. Determine if the event was a necessary OR sufficient part of the set of events that actually brought about the outcome. Apply the "difference-maker" test: ask if the event was pivotal in making the outcome happen in the specific scenario described. For this test, construct the counterfactual by changing only the target event and holding all other established facts and narrative constraints fixed.

**Step 0: Precisely Define the Outcome**
Before reasoning, identify the exact outcome described in the question. Do not generalize or abstract it. For example, "premature death" means death occurring at a specific time earlier than expected, not death in general. "The computer crashed" means the crash that happened at 10:00 AM, not the abstract concept of a crash.

**Key Principles for Application:**
- **Hold Narrative Facts Fixed:** In your counterfactual reasoning, do not alter other events, dispositions, or background conditions stated in the narrative. Only change the specific event in question.
- **Defaults and Deviations (Priority Rule):** This principle takes priority when the narrative clearly establishes a normal, expected, or prescribed course of action (a default).
    - **To test a DEVIANT event:** Hold the default world fixed. Your counterfactual should remove the deviation, and you may assume the world would otherwise have followed the default path.
    - **To test a DEFAULT event:** Your counterfactual must be consistent with the default world. If the deviation is a key narrative fact, you must consider if the deviation would still occur if the default event did not. Often, the deviant event is the true difference-maker.
- **Preemption:** An event is a cause if it was necessary to activate the actual causal chain that occurred (it preempted an alternative chain).
- **Asymmetric Overdetermination (e.g., multiple sufficient causes):** An event can be a cause if it was part of the actual causal set that brought about the outcome, even if it was not strictly necessary.
- **Symmetric Overdetermination (e.g., two identical sufficient causes):** In these specific cases, if the outcome would have occurred unchanged due to another identical, sufficient event even without the target event, then the target event is not a cause. The outcome is attributed to the collective set.
- **Inevitable Outcomes vs. Actual Proximate Causes:** If an outcome is described as inevitable in the future (e.g., "was certain to die"), but a specific event causes it to occur in a different way or at a specific time, focus on the actual proximate cause. The inevitable future cause is a background condition, not part of the actual causal chain for the *specific, timely outcome*. The proximate cause is the difference-maker for the outcome happening *as and when it did*.
- **Omissions/Double Prevention:** Treat omissions (failures to act) as potential causes if they were pivotal in allowing the actual causal chain to proceed, based on the narrative's expectations.

Accept the narrative's premises without skepticism (e.g., if the story states an action led to an outcome, take it as given). Avoid ethical judgments or external skepticism; focus solely on the described causal chain.

**Examples for guidance:**

**Example 1 (Answer: Yes - Asymmetric Overdetermination):**
Question: Drew, Kylie, and Oliver all ordered coffee. The shop profits if at least one orders. Did Drew's order cause the profit?
Reasoning: Drew's order was sufficient and part of the actual set of events that caused the profit. Even though not necessary (others ordered), it was still a cause.
Answer: Yes

**Example 2 (Answer: Yes - Preemption):**
Question: A doctor's signature was required but against policy. The drug was administered and caused recovery. Did the doctor's decision cause the recovery?
Reasoning: The doctor's decision was the pivotal difference-maker. Without it, the drug would not have been administered. It was necessary in the actual chain of events.
Answer: Yes

**Example 3 (Answer: No - Symmetric Overdetermination):**
Question: Two rocks, Rock A and Rock B, are thrown simultaneously at a window. Either rock alone has enough force to break the window. The window breaks. Did Rock A cause the window to break?
Reasoning: This is symmetric overdetermination. The window breaking was guaranteed by Rock B alone. If Rock A had not been thrown, the outcome would have been identical (the window would still be broken by Rock B). Rock A's throw was not a difference-maker.
Answer: No

**Example 4 (Answer: Yes - Omission with Narrative Constraints):**
Question: Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Reasoning: The narrative establishes that Wayne's only available action was to change the device's position. Holding narrative facts fixed, the direct counterfactual is that if he had acted, he would have moved the device off the pad. The device charges if it is EITHER plugged in OR on the pad. In the actual world, both conditions are met (Plugged AND On Pad). His inaction preserved the "on the pad" condition. If he had acted, he would have removed this condition, leaving only "plugged in." Since either condition is sufficient, the device would have charged anyway. However, his inaction was part of the actual sufficient set (P ∧ OP) that brought about the outcome. It was a cause.
Answer: Yes

**Example 5 (Answer: No - Deviation Principle):**
Question: Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Jane logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Lauren decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately. Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
Reasoning: The narrative establishes a policy as a key background condition, creating a default (Jane uses mornings) and a deviation (Lauren's login). Jane's action was the expected, normal behavior. To test if Jane's action caused the crash, we apply the deviation principle for a default event. We consider a counterfactual consistent with the default policy: if Jane had not logged on, the policy would have been violated by her absence. However, the primary, active deviation is Lauren's login. The more appropriate test is for the deviant event: if Lauren had not deviated and logged on, only Jane would be logged in (the default), and the crash would not have occurred. Therefore, Jane's normal action was not the difference-maker; Lauren's deviant action was.
Answer: No

**Example 6 (Answer: No - Deviation Principle):**
Question: Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Reasoning: The outcome is the sending of the empty email at that specific time. The narrative establishes a clear policy, making Zoe's 9:00 am login a deviation and Alice's 9:30 am login the expected default behavior for the morning. We are testing a default event (Alice's login). Applying the deviation principle, we reason about the default world. If Alice had not logged in at 9:30 am (deviating from her expected behavior), only the initial deviant (Zoe) would be logged in, and no email would be sent. This suggests Alice's action was necessary. However, the principle instructs us to consider if the primary deviation would still occur. The better causal analysis is to attribute the outcome to the initial, active deviation that created the precarious situation. If the deviant event (Zoe's login) had not occurred, and only the default (Alice's login) had happened, no email would have been sent. Therefore, Zoe's deviant action was the pivotal difference-maker. Alice's action, while necessary in the actual chain, was the default and not the cause of the outcome.
Answer: No

**Example 7 (Answer: Yes - Inevitable Outcome):**
Question: Long ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something new. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did misadministration of medication cause John's premature death?
Reasoning: The outcome is John's "premature death," meaning his death on that specific day in the hospital. Hold all narrative facts fixed: John had terminal cancer but was not dead yet. The misadministration of the drug caused an allergic reaction leading to immediate cardiac arrest and death. Now construct the counterfactual: if the medication had not been misadministered, what would have happened? John would have left the hospital alive. His death would not have occurred on that day. Therefore, for the specific outcome of "death on that day," the medication error was both necessary and sufficient. The cancer was a future sufficient cause but was not part of the actual causal chain that brought about the outcome on that day. It is a background condition.

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the role of an agent's specific action or inaction. Your goal is to determine if the behavior was the **salient or explanatory cause** in response to a "because" question, which often involves comparing it to normal expectations and considering the specific causal pathway. Follow these reasoning steps:

0.  **Interpret the Question's Focus:** Determine what the question is asking. Is it focusing on physical necessity, explanatory salience, responsibility, or the specific manner in which the outcome occurred? This interpretation guides the use of normality and pathway analysis.

1.  **Identify the Outcome and the Specific Agent Behavior:** State the outcome. Identify the precise action or inaction of the agent being questioned.
2.  **Identify the Causal Rules:** Determine the scenario's rules for the outcome. Note if multiple sufficient conditions exist (overdetermination) and whether conditions are necessary or sufficient.
3.  **Determine the Pre-existing Context:** Establish the state of the world before the agent's decision, including any relevant social norms, policies, statistical baselines, or expected behaviors.
4.  **Analyze Normality and Salience:** Assess the agent's knowledge and intent. Crucially, determine if their behavior was **normal, expected, and compliant** with rules or baselines, or if it was a **deviant, surprising, or interventionist** act. A normal action is often a background condition; a deviant action is often the explanatory cause.
5.  **Apply the Dual Counterfactual Tests:**
    *   **For an ACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent did **NOT** perform the action. Would the outcome have been prevented? If yes, the action was a *necessary cause*.
    *   **For an INACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent **DID** act. Would that action have prevented the outcome? If yes, the inaction was a *necessary cause*.
6.  **Make the Final Causal Judgment:** Use the following rules:
    *   If the behavior directly satisfied a **sufficient condition** for the outcome, it is **a cause**.
    *   In overdetermined cases, **all sufficient factors are causes**.
    *   **Rule A (Pathway Actualization):** If the behavior ensured the outcome occurred through one sufficient pathway rather than another, then for questions about *how* the outcome occurred, the behavior is a cause.
    *   **Rule B (Explanatory Salience):** If multiple factors were necessary, the cause is attributed to the one that was **most deviant from the normal or expected course of events** (e.g., a highly improbable event vs. a 50/50 chance).
    *   For questions implying **blame or responsibility**, the cause is attributed to the **deviant** action that created the problem.

**Example 1 (Action & Salience - Answer: No):**
- **Question Focus:** Salient cause of the win.
- Outcome: Alex wins the game.
- Behavior: Alex flipped the coin (it came up heads).
- Causal Rules: Win if (dice > 11) AND (coin = heads). Both necessary.
- Context: Dice and flip are simultaneous. Rolling >11 is very unlikely; coin flip is 50/50.
- **Normality/Salience:** The coin flip was normal and expected. The dice roll was deviant and surprising.
- Counterfactual (Action): If no coin flip, no win. It was physically necessary.
- **Judgment (Rule B):** The win is explained "because of" the surprising dice roll, not the normal coin flip.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 2 (Inaction & Pathway - Answer: Yes):**
- **Question Focus:** Whether the charging happened *in the specific way it did* because of the inaction.
- Outcome: Device is fully charged.
- Behavior: Wayne did not change the position of the device.
- Causal Rules: Charges if *either* plugged in (P) OR on charging pad (C).
- Context: At 2:00 PM, both P and C were true.
- **Normality/Salience:** Wayne's inaction preserved the C pathway.
- Counterfactual (Inaction): If Wayne *had* acted (moved device), only P would be true, and the outcome would still occur.
- **Judgment (Rule A):** The outcome occurred through the C pathway because Wayne did not change the position.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 3 (Inaction & Overdetermination - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Clothes dried in sixty minutes.
- Behavior: David did not change the temperature setting.
- Causal Rules: Dries in 60 min if *either* MAX DRY *or* HIGH temp.
- Context: Both MAX DRY and HIGH temp were true.
- Agency/Norms: David checked and intentionally preserved the HIGH temp state.
- Counterfactual (Inaction): If David *had* changed the temp, the MAX DRY condition alone would still have caused the outcome.
- Judgment: The inaction did not change the fact that a sufficient condition (MAX DRY) was met. It was not a cause.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 (Action & Responsibility - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Computer crashed.
- Behavior: Jane logged on at her permitted time (9:00 am).
- Causal Rules: Crashes if two users are logged in simultaneously.
- Context: A policy existed to prevent this. Lauren violated it by logging on at 9:00 am.
- **Normality/Salience:** Jane's action was compliant and expected. Lauren's was deviant.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Jane had not logged on, the crash would not have occurred.
- Judgment: While Jane's login was a necessary physical condition, the cause is attributed to Lauren's deviant action.

### **PATHWAY 1: FOR CAUSAL ATTRIBUTION QUESTIONS**

**Follow these steps for questions about whether an action/inaction WAS A CAUSE of an outcome:**

1.  **Identify the Outcome and the Specific Agent Behavior:** State the outcome. Identify the precise action or inaction of the agent being questioned.
2.  **Identify the Causal Rules:** Determine the scenario's rules for the outcome. Note if multiple sufficient conditions exist (overdetermination).
3.  **Determine the Pre-existing Context:** Establish the state of the world before the agent's decision, including any relevant social norms, policies, or expected behaviors.
4.  **Analyze Agency and Norms:** Assess the agent's knowledge. Determine if their behavior was compliant with rules and expectations or was a deviant act. This is key for questions implying responsibility.
5.  **Apply the Dual Counterfactual Tests:**
    *   **For an ACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent did **NOT** perform the action. Would the outcome have been prevented? If yes, the action was a *necessary cause*.
    *   **For an INACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent **DID** act. Would that action have prevented the outcome? If yes, the inaction was a *necessary cause*.
6.  **Make the Final Causal Judgment:** A behavior can be **a** cause even if not necessary.
    *   If the behavior directly satisfied a **sufficient condition** for the outcome, it is **a cause**.
    *   In overdetermined cases, **all sufficient factors are causes**.
    *   For questions implying **blame or responsibility**, an action that was a necessary condition but was **reasonable, expected, and compliant** with norms is typically not considered the "cause." The cause is attributed to the **deviant** action that created the problem.

**Causal Attribution Examples:**

**Example 1 (Action & Overdetermination - Answer: Yes):**
- Outcome: Alex wins the game.
- Behavior: Alex spun the spinner (it landed on green).
- Causal Rules: Win if (dice > 2) OR (spinner green).
- Context: Dice and spin are simultaneous. Both conditions were met.
- Agency/Norms: Alex acted as required by the game.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Alex had not spun, the win would still have occurred (dice=12).
- Judgment: The spin produced a sufficient condition (green). Therefore, it is **a cause**.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Inaction & Overdetermination - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Clothes dried in sixty minutes.
- Behavior: David did not change the temperature setting.
- Causal Rules: Dries in 60 min if *either* MAX DRY *or* HIGH temp.
- Context: Both MAX DRY and HIGH temp were true.
- Agency/Norms: David checked and intentionally preserved the HIGH temp state.
- Counterfactual (Inaction): If David *had* changed the temp, the MAX DRY condition alone would still have caused the outcome.
- Judgment: The inaction did not change the fact that a sufficient condition (MAX DRY) was met. It was not a cause.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Action & Responsibility - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Computer crashed.
- Behavior: Jane logged on at her permitted time (9:00 am).
- Causal Rules: Crashes if two users are logged in simultaneously.
- Context: A policy existed to prevent this. Lauren violated it by logging on at 9:00 am.
- Agency/Norms: Jane's action was compliant and expected. Lauren's was deviant.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Jane had not logged on, the crash would not have occurred.
- Judgment: While Jane's login was a necessary physical condition, the cause is attributed to Lauren's deviant action that violated the policy and created the crash condition.
<answer>No</answer>

### **PATHWAY 2: FOR INTENTIONAL ATTRIBUTION QUESTIONS**

**Follow these steps for questions about whether an agent INTENDED an outcome:**

1.  **Identify the Outcome and the Specific Agent Behavior:** State the outcome in question. Identify the agent's precise action.
2.  **Determine the Agent's Goals and Knowledge:** What was the agent's primary goal or desire? Crucially, what did the agent know at the time of acting? Did they know the outcome was **certain** (definite, inevitable) or merely **possible/risky**?
3.  **Apply the Test of Certainty:**
    *   If the agent knew the outcome was **certain** (or virtually certain) to occur as a direct result of their action, then the outcome is **intended**, even if it was not their primary goal. The agent purposefully brought it about.
    *   If the outcome was only a **foreseeable possibility or risk**, then it is **not intended**. The agent may be responsible (e.g., reckless or negligent) but did not act with specific intent.
4.  **Make the Final Intentionality Judgment:** Base your judgment on the certainty of the outcome from the agent's perspective, not just their primary desire.

**Intentional Attribution Examples:**

**Example 4 (Certain Harm - Answer: Yes):**
- Outcome: A bird-watcher was shot.
- Behavior: The hunter shot at the deer.
- Goals/Knowledge: The hunter's primary goal was to win the competition. He knew with **certainty** that the bullet would hit a bird-watcher. The harm was not a risk, but a guaranteed side-effect.
- Test of Certainty: The harm was a **certain** consequence of his chosen action. Therefore, he intended it.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 5 (Risky Harm - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: A pedestrian was hit by a car.
- Behavior: A driver sped through a neighborhood to get home faster.
- Goals/Knowledge: The driver's goal was to get home quickly. He knew speeding created a **risk** of hitting someone, but did not know it was certain.
- Test of Certainty: The harm was a **foreseeable risk**, not a certainty. Therefore, he did not intend it (though he was reckless).
<answer>No</answer>

2025-09-09 19:35:00,580 - 📊 Current Prompt:
Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the role of an agent's specific action or inaction. Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Determine the Question's Frame:** First, decide if the question is asking about:
    *   **(A) Physical Causation:** The question is neutrally phrased (e.g., "Did X cause Y?") and is purely about counterfactual dependence and causal mechanisms. **--> Proceed with physical analysis.**
    *   **(B) Normative Attribution:** The question implies blame, responsibility, credit, or praise (e.g., "Is X to blame for Y?", "Should X be credited for Y?"). **--> Proceed with normative analysis.**

2.  **Identify the Outcome and the Specific Agent Behavior:** State the outcome. Identify the precise action or inaction of the agent being questioned.

3.  **Identify the Causal Rules:** Determine the scenario's rules for the outcome. Note if multiple sufficient conditions exist (overdetermination) or if one cause preempts another (where a deviant act makes a routine action causally irrelevant for attribution).

4.  **Determine the Pre-existing Context:** Establish the state of the world before the agent's decision, including any relevant social norms, policies, or expected behaviors.

5.  **Analyze Agency and Norms:** Assess the agent's knowledge and intent. Determine if their behavior was compliant with rules and expectations or was a deviant act.

6.  **Apply the Dual Counterfactual Tests:**
    *   **For an ACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent did **NOT** perform the action. Would the outcome have been prevented? If yes, the action was a *necessary condition*.
    *   **For an INACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent **DID** act. Would that action have prevented the outcome? If yes, the inaction was a *necessary condition*.

7.  **Make the Final Causal Judgment:**
    *   **For Physical Causation (from Step 1A):** A behavior is **a cause** if it was a necessary element of a sufficient set of conditions that led to the outcome. Answer "Yes".
    *   **For Normative Attribution (from Step 1B):**
        *   If the behavior was a **deviant** violation of norms/policy that created the problem, it is the cause. Answer "Yes".
        *   If the behavior was **compliant, expected, and reasonable**, even if physically necessary, it is typically **not** considered the cause for attribution purposes. The cause is attributed to the deviant act or the background conditions. Answer "No".
        *   **Preemption Exception:** If a deviant action preempts a standard causal process, the deviant action is the cause. Necessary but non-deviant actions in the chain are not considered the primary cause for attribution. Answer "No" for the compliant agent, "Yes" for the deviant one.

**Example 1 (Action & Overdetermination - Physical Causation: Yes):**
- Outcome: Alex wins the game.
- Behavior: Alex spun the spinner (it landed on green).
- Causal Rules: Win if (dice > 2) OR (spinner green).
- Context: Dice and spin are simultaneous. Both conditions were met.
- Agency/Norms: Alex acted as required by the game.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Alex had not spun, the win would still have occurred (dice=12).
- Judgment (Physical): The spin produced a sufficient condition (green). Therefore, it is **a cause**.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Inaction & Overdetermination - Physical Causation: No):**
- Outcome: Clothes dried in sixty minutes.
- Behavior: David did not change the temperature setting.
- Causal Rules: Dries in 60 min if *either* MAX DRY *or* HIGH temp.
- Context: Both MAX DRY and HIGH temp were true.
- Agency/Norms: David checked and intentionally preserved the HIGH temp state.
- Counterfactual (Inaction): If David *had* changed the temp, the MAX DRY condition alone would still have caused the outcome.
- Judgment (Physical): The inaction did not change the fact that a sufficient condition (MAX DRY) was met. It was not a cause.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Action & Responsibility - Normative Attribution: No):**
- Outcome: Computer crashed.
- Behavior: Jane logged on at her permitted time (9:00 am).
- Causal Rules: Crashes if two users are logged in simultaneously.
- Context: A policy existed to prevent this. Lauren violated it by logging on at 9:00 am.
- Agency/Norms: Jane's action was compliant and expected. Lauren's was deviant.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Jane had not logged on, the crash would not have occurred.
- Judgment (Normative): While Jane's login was a necessary physical condition, the cause is attributed to Lauren's deviant action that violated the policy.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 (Simultaneous Login - Physical Causation: Yes):**
- Outcome: Emails were deleted.
- Behavior: Suzy logged into the central computer at 9 am.
- Causal Rules: Deletion occurs if two people log in simultaneously.
- Context: Company policy permitted both to log in at 9 am. The deletion risk was unknown.
- Agency/Norms: Suzy's action was compliant and expected.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Suzy had not logged in, only Billy would have logged in, the simultaneous condition would not have been met, and the deletion would not have occurred.
- Judgment (Physical): The question is neutral ("did cause"). Suzy's action was a necessary part of the sufficient condition (two logins). It is a physical cause.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 5 (Pharmacist's Signature - Normative Attribution: No):**
- Outcome: Patient recovered.
- Behavior: The pharmacist signed off on the drug request (a routine check of inventory).
- Causal Rules: Recovery resulted from the drug, which required two signatures.
- Context: A hospital policy forbade this drug due to risks. The doctor knowingly violated this policy to sign off.
- Agency/Norms: Pharmacist's action was compliant and routine. Doctor's action was deviant.
- Counterfactual (Action): If the pharmacist had not signed, the drug would not have been administered.
- Judgment (Normative): The question implies attribution for a positive outcome. However, the doctor's deviant action preempts the standard process. The pharmacist's routine, compliant action is not considered the cause; the cause is attributed to the doctor's deviant decision.

        *   **Identify the Actual Outcome:** What specifically happened?
        *   **Analyze the Plan vs. Execution:** Did the outcome happen directly because of the agent's planned action, or due to an accident, mistake, or unexpected intervention?
        *   **Apply the Test of Specific Intent:** Was the *specific manner* of the outcome part of the agent's plan? Or was it a different means to the same end?
        *   Answer "Yes" only if the agent specifically intended the outcome *exactly as it occurred*.
    *   **For Normative Attribution (from Step 1C):**
        *   First, **establish if the behavior was a physical cause** using the test above. If it was not, answer "No".

**Example 6 (Intentionality - Mental State: No):**
- Question: "Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?"
- Outcome: Aunt died from a bullet to the heart.
- Behavior: Jake aimed and pulled the trigger, but his hand slipped.
- Desired Outcome: Jake intended to kill his aunt.
- Actual Outcome: The aunt was killed by a shot to the heart caused by a slip.
- Plan vs. Execution: Jake planned a well-aimed shot. The fatal shot to the heart was a result of an unplanned slip during execution.
- Specific Intent: Jake did not specifically intend the shot to land in the heart *as a result of a slip*; this specific manner was accidental.
- Judgment (Mental State): The outcome was intended (death) but the specific means (heart shot via slip) was not. Therefore, he did not shoot her in the heart intentionally.

**Example 7 (Overdetermination & Physical Cause - Physical Causation: Yes):**
- Outcome: Motion detector went off.
- Behavior: Billy arrived at 9 am.
- Causal Rules: Detector triggers if *at least one person* is present.
- Context: Both Billy and Suzy were instructed to arrive at 9 am. They complied.
- Agency/Norms: Billy's action was compliant.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Billy had not arrived, Suzy's arrival alone would have triggered the detector (overdetermination).
- Judgment (Physical): Billy's arrival was part of a sufficient set of conditions (his presence + Suzy's presence). Under the revised physical causation rule, he is **a cause**.

2025-09-09 19:40:08,658 - 📊 Current Prompt:
Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the role of an agent's specific action or inaction. Your goal is to determine if the behavior was **a cause** of the outcome, considering both physical necessity and explanatory salience. Follow these reasoning steps:

0.  **Interpret the Question's Focus:** Determine what the question is asking. Is it focusing on physical causation, explanatory salience, responsibility, or the specific manner in which the outcome occurred? Note: For outcomes described as a "problem," the normative violation may be part of the outcome to be explained.

1.  **Identify the Outcome and the Specific Agent Behavior:** State the outcome. Identify the precise action or inaction of the agent being questioned.
2.  **Identify the Causal Rules:** Determine the scenario's rules for the outcome. Note if multiple sufficient conditions exist (overdetermination) and whether conditions are necessary or sufficient.
3.  **Determine the Pre-existing Context:** Establish the state of the world before the agent's decision, including any relevant social norms, policies, statistical baselines, or expected behaviors.
4.  **Analyze Normality and Salience:** Assess the agent's knowledge and intent. Determine if their behavior was **normal, expected, and compliant** with rules or baselines, or if it was a **deviant, surprising, or interventionist** act.
5.  **Apply the Dual Counterfactual Tests:**
    *   **For an ACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent did **NOT** perform the action. Would the outcome have been prevented? If yes, the action was a *necessary cause*.
    *   **For an INACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent **DID** act. Would that action have prevented the outcome? If yes, the inaction was a *necessary cause*.
6.  **Make the Final Causal Judgment:** Use the following rules:
    *   **Rule 1 (Necessary Cause):** If the behavior was a **necessary condition** (it passes the counterfactual test), it is **a cause**.
    *   **Rule 2 (Sufficient Cause):** If the behavior directly satisfied a **sufficient condition** for the outcome, it is **a cause**.
    *   **Rule 3 (Overdetermination):** In overdetermined cases, **all sufficient factors are causes**. The outcome occurring anyway does not negate that a factor was *a* cause.
    *   **Rule 4 (Pathway Actualization):** If the behavior ensured the outcome occurred through one sufficient pathway rather than another, then for questions about *how* the outcome occurred, the behavior is **a cause**.
    *   **Rule 5 (Explanatory Salience):** If multiple factors were causes, the **most informative cause** for a general 'because' question is often the one that was **most deviant** from the normal or expected course of events.
    *   **Rule 6 (Blame/Responsibility):** For questions directly about **blame or responsibility**, the cause is attributed to the **deviant, intentional, or negligent** action that created the problem. A normal or compliant action is rarely blamed, even if it was a physical cause.
7.  **Synthesize and Answer:**
    *   If the behavior was a necessary cause (Rule 1), a sufficient cause (Rule 2), or actualized a specific pathway (Rule 4), answer **Yes** (it was *a* cause).
    *   If the question asks for the *primary* or *most explanatory* cause (e.g., 'mainly because') and another factor is more salient/deviant (Rule 5), you may answer **No**.
    *   Weigh the rules above based on the question's focus identified in Step 0.

**Example 1 (Inaction & Pathway - Answer: Yes):**
- **Question Focus:** Causal contribution via a specific pathway.
- Outcome: Device is fully charged.
- Behavior: Wayne did not change the position of the device.
- Causal Rules: Charges if *either* plugged in (P) OR on charging pad (C).
- Context: At 2:00 PM, both P and C were true.
- **Normality/Salience:** Wayne's inaction was normal.
- Counterfactual (Inaction): If Wayne *had* acted (moved device), only P would be true, and the outcome would still occur.
- **Judgment (Rule 4):** The outcome occurred through the C pathway because Wayne did not change the position. It was *a* cause.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Inaction & Necessity - Answer: Yes):**
- **Question Focus:** Causal contribution of a necessary inaction.
- Outcome: Machine broke down.
- Behavior: Kate did not put oil in the machine.
- Causal Rules: Machine breaks down if no oil is applied.
- Context: Janet (responsible) forgot to oil. Kate (not responsible) knew but did not act.
- **Normality/Salience:** Kate's inaction was norm-compliant, but Janet's was deviant.
- Counterfactual (Inaction): If Kate *had* acted (put oil), the breakdown would have been prevented.
- **Judgment (Rule 1):** Kate's inaction was a necessary cause. It was *a* cause, even if not blameworthy (Rule 6).
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 3 (Action & Normative Problem - Answer: Yes):**
- **Question Focus:** Cause of a "problem" defined by a norm violation.
- Outcome: No pencils for polar bear (a problem).
- Behavior: Hedgehog took a pencil (violating a known rule).
- Causal Rules: Only bears are allowed. Pencils are finite.
- Context: Bear also took pencils, but legally. Total consumption would have been identical if hedgehog hadn't taken one.
- **Normality/Salience:** Hedgehog's action was deviant and rule-breaking.
- Counterfactual (Action): If hedgehog had not taken a pencil, the bear would have, and the physical outcome (no pencils) would be identical. However, the *problem* (a violation causing scarcity) would not exist in the same way.
- **Judgment (Rule 6, Rule 4):** The hedgehog's deviant action is the cause of the *problem* being a normative violation, even if not necessary for the physical scarcity.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Inaction & Overdetermination - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Clothes dried in sixty minutes.
- Behavior: David did not change the temperature setting.
- Causal Rules: Dries in 60 min if *either* MAX DRY *or* HIGH temp.
- Context: Both MAX DRY and HIGH temp were true.
- Agency/Norms: David checked and intentionally preserved the HIGH temp state.
- Counterfactual (Inaction): If David *had* changed the temp, the MAX DRY condition alone would still have caused the outcome.
- Judgment: The inaction did not satisfy a new sufficient condition (Rule 2), was not necessary (Rule 1), and did not change the pathway (Rule 4). It was not a cause.

Answer questions about causal and intentional attribution by carefully analyzing the role of an agent's specific action or inaction. First, classify the primary focus of the question:

*   **Causal Attribution Question:** The question asks if the agent's behavior **was a cause** of the outcome. (e.g., "Did X cause Y?", "Was X responsible for Y?")
*   **Intentional Attribution Question:** The question asks if the agent **intended** the outcome or acted with purpose. (e.g., "Did X intentionally do Y?", "Did X mean to do Y?")

Then, follow the appropriate reasoning pathway.

---

### **PATHWAY 1: FOR CAUSAL ATTRIBUTION QUESTIONS**

**Follow these steps for questions about whether an action/inaction WAS A CAUSE of an outcome:**

1.  **Identify the Outcome and the Specific Agent Behavior:** State the outcome. Identify the precise action or inaction of the agent being questioned.
2.  **Identify the Causal Rules and Structure:** Determine the scenario's rules for the outcome. Classify the causal structure:
    *   **SUFFICIENT Cause (OR-gate):** The outcome occurs if A OR B OR C is true.
    *   **NECESSARY Cause (AND-gate):** The outcome occurs **only if** A AND B AND C are true.
    Note if multiple sufficient conditions exist (overdetermination).
3.  **Determine the Pre-existing Context:** Establish the state of the world before the agent's decision, including any relevant social norms, policies, or expected behaviors. Identify any *default* or *expected* processes that would lead to the outcome.
4.  **Analyze Agency and Norms:** Assess the agent's knowledge and intent. Determine if their behavior was compliant with rules and expectations or was a deviant act. For inaction, determine if it was a deliberate choice to *preserve* a state.
5.  **Apply the Dual Counterfactual Tests:**
    *   **For an ACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent did **NOT** perform the action. Would the outcome have been prevented? If yes, the action was a *necessary cause*.
    *   **For an INACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent **DID** act (performing the specific action they omitted). Would that action have prevented the outcome? If yes, the inaction was a *necessary cause*.
6.  **Make the Final Causal Judgment:**
    *   **For SUFFICIENT Causes (OR-gates):**
        *   If the agent's behavior **created** a new sufficient condition, it is **a cause**.
        *   If the agent's behavior **intentionally preserved** a pre-existing sufficient condition, it can be considered **a cause**.
        *   **However, in cases of overdetermination with default causes:** If the outcome would have been caused **anyway by a default, normal, or expected process**, and the agent's action was merely a redundant addition, then it is **not** considered the cause. The cause is attributed to the default process.
    *   **For NECESSARY Causes (AND-gates):**
        *   If the agent's behavior satisfied a necessary condition, it is **a cause**.
        *   **However, for questions using "because of":** If one necessary condition was highly improbable or required special effort, and the other was trivial or likely, the cause is typically attributed to the improbable condition.
    *   **For questions implying responsibility:** Even if a behavior was a cause, if it was **reasonable, expected, and compliant** with norms, the cause is attributed to the **deviant** action that created the problem.

**Causal Attribution Examples:**

**Example 1 (Action & Overdetermination - Answer: Yes):**
- Outcome: Alex wins the game.
- Behavior: Alex spun the spinner (it landed on green).
- Causal Rules: Win if (dice > 2) OR (spinner green). [SUFFICIENT/OR]
- Context: Dice and spin are simultaneous. Both conditions were met.
- Agency/Norms: Alex acted as required by the game.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Alex had not spun, the win would still have occurred (dice=12).
- Judgment: The spin produced a sufficient condition (green). Therefore, it is **a cause**.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Inaction & Overdetermination - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Clothes dried in sixty minutes.
- Behavior: David did not change the temperature setting.
- Causal Rules: Dries in 60 min if *either* MAX DRY *or* HIGH temp. [SUFFICIENT/OR]
- Context: Both MAX DRY and HIGH temp were true. MAX DRY was the active, sufficient state.
- Agency/Norms: David checked and intentionally preserved the HIGH temp state.
- Counterfactual (Inaction): If David *had* changed the temp, the MAX DRY condition alone would still have caused the outcome.
- Judgment: The inaction did not change the fact that a sufficient condition (MAX DRY) was met. It was not a cause.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Action & Responsibility - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Computer crashed.
- Behavior: Jane logged on at her permitted time (9:00 am).
- Causal Rules: Crashes if two users are logged in simultaneously. [NECESSARY/AND for the crash]
- Context: A policy existed to prevent this. Lauren violated it by logging on at 9:00 am.
- Agency/Norms: Jane's action was compliant and expected. Lauren's was deviant.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Jane had not logged on, the crash would not have occurred.
- Judgment: While Jane's login was a necessary physical condition, the cause is attributed to Lauren's deviant action that violated the policy and created the crash condition.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 (Necessary Cause & "Because of" - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Alex wins the game.
- Behavior: Alex flipped the coin (it came up heads).
- Causal Rules: Win **only if** (dice > 11) **AND** (coin = heads). [NECESSARY/AND]
- Context: The dice roll was highly improbable; the coin flip was 50/50.
- Agency/Norms: Alex acted as required.
- Counterfactual (Action): If the coin had not come up heads, Alex would not have won.
- Judgment: While the coin flip was a necessary condition, the win is attributed to the improbable dice roll for the purpose of "because of". The coin flip was a prerequisite, not the explanatory cause.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 (Overdetermination with Defaults - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Coffee shop made a profit.
- Behavior: Drew ordered coffee.
- Causal Rules: Profit if **anyone** orders coffee. [SUFFICIENT/OR]
- Context: Kylie and Oliver *usually* order and *did* order. Their orders were the default, expected cause.
- Agency/Norms: Drew's action was unexpected but not deviant.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Drew had not ordered, the profit would still have occurred due to Kylie and Oliver.
- Judgment: The profit was guaranteed by the default process. Drew's redundant action is not considered the cause.
<answer>No</answer>

### **PATHWAY 2: FOR INTENTIONAL ATTRIBUTION QUESTIONS**

**Follow these steps for questions about whether an agent INTENDED an outcome:**

1.  **Identify the Outcome and the Specific Agent Behavior:** State the outcome in question. Identify the agent's precise action.
2.  **Determine the Agent's Goals and Knowledge:** What was the agent's primary goal or desire? Crucially, what did the agent know at the time of acting? Did they know the outcome was **certain** (definite, inevitable) or merely **possible/risky**?
3.  **Apply the Test of Certainty:**
    *   If the agent knew the outcome was **certain** (or virtually certain) to occur as a direct result of their action, then the outcome is **intended**, even if it was not their primary goal. The agent purposefully brought it about.
    *   If the outcome was only a **foreseeable possibility or risk**, then it is **not intended**. The agent may be responsible (e.g., reckless or negligent) but did not act with specific intent.
4.  **Make the Final Intentionality Judgment:** Base your judgment on the certainty of the outcome from the agent's perspective, not just their primary desire.

**Intentional Attribution Examples:**

**Example 6 (Certain Harm - Answer: Yes):**
- Outcome: A bird-watcher was shot.
- Behavior: The hunter shot at the deer.
- Goals/Knowledge: The hunter's primary goal was to win the competition. He knew with **certainty** that the bullet would hit a bird-watcher. The harm was not a risk, but a guaranteed side-effect.
- Test of Certainty: The harm was a **certain** consequence of his chosen action. Therefore, he intended it.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 7 (Risky Harm - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: A pedestrian was hit by a car.
- Behavior: A driver sped through a neighborhood to get home faster.
- Goals/Knowledge: The driver's goal was to get home quickly. He knew speeding created a **risk** of hitting someone, but did not know it was certain.
- Test of Certainty: The harm was a **foreseeable risk**, not a certainty. Therefore, he did not intend it (though he was reckless).
<answer>No</answer>

2025-09-09 19:44:52,710 - 📊 Current Prompt:
Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the role of an agent's specific action or inaction. Your goal is to determine if the behavior was **the explanatory cause** in response to a "because" question, which hinges on whether the action was the most salient reason the outcome occurred, not just a physical cause. Follow these reasoning steps:

0.  **Interpret the Question's Focus:** Determine what the question is asking. The word "because" asks for the **most explanatory cause**. Is the question focusing on physical causation, explanatory salience, responsibility, or the specific manner in which the outcome occurred? Note: For outcomes described as a "problem," the normative violation may be part of the outcome to be explained.

1.  **Identify the Outcome and the Specific Agent Behavior:** State the outcome. Identify the precise action or inaction of the agent being questioned.
2.  **Identify the Causal Rules:** Determine the scenario's rules for the outcome. Note if multiple sufficient conditions exist (overdetermination) and whether conditions are necessary or sufficient.
3.  **Determine the Pre-existing Context:** Establish the state of the world before the agent's decision, including any relevant social norms, policies, statistical baselines, or expected behaviors.
4.  **Analyze Normality and Salience:** Assess the agent's knowledge and intent. Determine if their behavior was **normal, expected, and compliant** with rules or baselines, or if it was a **deviant, surprising, or interventionist** act. A normal/redundant action is often a background condition; a deviant action is often the explanatory cause.
5.  **Apply the Dual Counterfactual Tests:**
    *   **For an ACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent did **NOT** perform the action. Would the outcome have been prevented? If yes, the action was a *necessary cause*.
    *   **For an INACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent **DID** act. Would that action have prevented the outcome? If yes, the inaction was a *necessary cause*.
6.  **Make the Final Causal Judgment:** Use the following rules:
    *   **Rule 1 (Necessary Cause):** If the behavior was a **necessary condition** (it passes the counterfactual test), it is **a cause** and is highly explanatory. Answer **Yes**.
    *   **Rule 2 (Sufficient Cause):** If the behavior directly satisfied a **sufficient condition** for the outcome, it is **a cause**. However, if that condition was already satisfied by another factor (redundant overdetermination), it is **not the explanatory cause** for a "because" question.
    *   **Rule 3 (Overdetermination):** In overdetermined cases, **all sufficient factors are physical causes**. But for a "because" question, the explanatory cause is the one that was **not redundant**.
    *   **Rule 4 (Pathway Actualization):** If the behavior ensured the outcome occurred through one sufficient pathway rather than another, then for questions about *how* the outcome occurred, the behavior is **a cause**.
    *   **Rule 5 (Explanatory Salience):** The **most informative cause** for a 'because' question is the one that was **most deviant** from the normal or expected course of events. A redundant action is rarely explanatory.
    *   **Rule 6 (Blame/Responsibility):** For questions directly about **blame or responsibility**, the cause is attributed to the **deviant, intentional, or negligent** action that created the problem. A normal or compliant action is rarely blamed, even if it was a physical cause.
7.  **Synthesize and Answer:**
    *   If the behavior was a **necessary cause (Rule 1)**, answer **Yes**.
    *   If the behavior was **not necessary** but satisfied a sufficient condition **(Rule 2)** or actualized a pathway **(Rule 4)**:
        *   For a general 'was X a cause?' question, it is *a* cause.
        *   For a 'did Y happen *because* of X?' question (an **explanatory query**):
            *   If the behavior was **deviant, surprising, or interventionist** (it created a new problem or changed the method), answer **Yes**.
            *   If the behavior was **normal, routine, or redundant** (it merely added a duplicate cause to an already guaranteed outcome), answer **No**. The outcome would have happened anyway, so this is not the explanatory reason.
    *   Weigh the rules above based on the question's focus identified in Step 0.

**Example 1 (Inaction & Pathway - Answer: Yes):**
- **Question Focus:** Causal contribution via a specific pathway.
- Outcome: Device is fully charged.
- Behavior: Wayne did not change the position of the device.
- Causal Rules: Charges if *either* plugged in (P) OR on charging pad (C).
- Context: At 2:00 PM, both P and C were true.
- **Normality/Salience:** Wayne's inaction was normal.
- Counterfactual (Inaction): If Wayne *had* acted (moved device), only P would be true, and the outcome would still occur.
- **Judgment (Rule 4):** The outcome occurred through the C pathway because Wayne did not change the position. It was *a* cause for this specific pathway question.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Inaction & Necessity - Answer: Yes):**
- **Question Focus:** Causal contribution of a necessary inaction.
- Outcome: Machine broke down.
- Behavior: Kate did not put oil in the machine.
- Causal Rules: Machine breaks down if no oil is applied.
- Context: Janet (responsible) forgot to oil. Kate (not responsible) knew but did not act.
- **Normality/Salience:** Kate's inaction was norm-compliant, but Janet's was deviant.
- Counterfactual (Inaction): If Kate *had* acted (put oil), the breakdown would have been prevented.
- **Judgment (Rule 1):** Kate's inaction was a necessary cause. It was *a* cause, even if not blameworthy (Rule 6).
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 3 (Action & Normative Problem - Answer: Yes):**
- **Question Focus:** Cause of a "problem" defined by a norm violation.
- Outcome: No pencils for polar bear (a problem).
- Behavior: Hedgehog took a pencil (violating a known rule).
- Causal Rules: Only bears are allowed. Pencils are finite.
- Context: Bear also took pencils, but legally. Total consumption would have been identical if hedgehog hadn't taken one.
- **Normality/Salience:** Hedgehog's action was deviant and rule-breaking.
- Counterfactual (Action): If hedgehog had not taken a pencil, the bear would have, and the physical outcome (no pencils) would be identical. However, the *problem* (a violation causing scarcity) would not exist in the same way.
- **Judgment (Rule 6, Rule 4):** The hedgehog's deviant action is the cause of the *problem* being a normative violation, even if not necessary for the physical scarcity.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Inaction & Overdetermination - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Clothes dried in sixty minutes.
- Behavior: David did not change the temperature setting.
- Causal Rules: Dries in 60 min if *either* MAX DRY *or* HIGH temp.
- Context: Both MAX DRY and HIGH temp were true.
- Agency/Norms: David checked and intentionally preserved the HIGH temp state.
- Counterfactual (Inaction): If David *had* changed the temp, the MAX DRY condition alone would still have caused the outcome.
- Judgment: The inaction did not satisfy a new sufficient condition (Rule 2), was not necessary (Rule 1), and did not change the pathway (Rule 4). It was not a cause.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 (Action & Redundant Overdetermination - Answer: No):**
- **Question Focus:** Explanatory cause in an overdetermined scenario.
- Outcome: The building imploded.
- Behavior: Tom turned Knob A from Off to On.
- Causal Rules: Implodes if Safety Switch Off OR Knob A On.
- Context: The Safety Switch was already Off, making the implosion inevitable.
- **Normality/Salience:** Tom's action was likely part of a standard procedure (normal), but it was redundant.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Tom had not turned the knob, the outcome would have occurred identically.
- **Judgment (Rule 2, Rule 5):** While Tom's action satisfied a sufficient condition, it was **explanatorily redundant**. The implosion was already going to happen *because* the Safety Switch was Off. Therefore, for a "because" question, the answer is No.
<answer>No</answer>

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the role of an agent's specific action or inaction. Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Determine the Question's Frame:** First, decide if the question is asking about:
    *   **(A) Physical Causation:** The question is neutrally phrased (e.g., "Did X cause Y?") and is purely about counterfactual dependence and causal mechanisms. **--> Proceed with physical analysis.**
    *   **(B) Mental State Attribution:** The question is about the agent's knowledge, purpose, or intent (e.g., "Did X intend Y?", "Did X know Y?"). **--> Proceed with intentionality analysis.**
    *   **(C) Normative Attribution:** The question implies blame, responsibility, credit, or praise (e.g., "Is X to blame for Y?", "Should X be credited for Y?"). **--> Proceed with normative analysis.**

2.  **Identify the Outcome and the Specific Agent Behavior:** State the outcome. Identify the precise action or inaction of the agent being questioned.

3.  **Identify the Causal Rules:** Determine the scenario's rules for the outcome. Note if multiple sufficient conditions exist (overdetermination) or if one cause preempts another.

4.  **Determine the Pre-existing Context:** Establish the state of the world before the agent's decision, including any relevant social norms, policies, or expected behaviors.

5.  **Analyze Agency and Norms:** Assess the agent's knowledge and intent. Determine if their behavior was compliant with rules and expectations or was a deviant act.

6.  **Apply the Dual Counterfactual Tests:**
    *   **For an ACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent did **NOT** perform the action. Would the outcome have been prevented? If yes, the action was a *necessary condition*.
    *   **For an INACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent **DID** act. Would that action have prevented the outcome? If yes, the inaction was a *necessary condition*.

7.  **Check for Causal Preemption and Redundancy (CRITICAL STEP):**
    *   **Preemption Check:** Was the outcome already ensured by a sufficient cause that was independent of the agent's behavior? If yes, the agent's behavior is **not a cause**, even if the counterfactual test suggests necessity.
    *   **Redundancy Check for Inaction:** If the agent's inaction did not actively contribute to creating the problem but merely failed to rectify a pre-existing issue caused by another agent, it is **not a cause**.

8.  **Make the Final Judgment:**
    *   **For Physical Causation (from Step 1A):** A behavior is **a cause** if it was:
        *   A necessary condition (and not preempted), OR
        *   A sufficient condition, OR
        *   An active part of the actual causal process that produced the outcome.
        *   In cases of overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes), all active sufficient conditions are considered "causes."
        *   **Answer "Yes" only if the behavior was causally relevant and not preempted.**
    *   **For Mental State Attribution (from Step 1B):**
        *   **Identify the Desired Outcome:** What was the agent's goal or purpose?
        *   **Identify the Actual Outcome:** What specifically happened?
        *   **Analyze the Plan vs. Execution:** Did the outcome happen directly because of the agent's planned action, or due to an accident, mistake, or unexpected intervention?
        *   **Apply the Test of Specific Intent:** Was the *specific manner* of the outcome part of the agent's plan? Or was it a different means to the same end?
        *   Answer "Yes" only if the agent specifically intended the outcome *exactly as it occurred*.
    *   **For Normative Attribution (from Step 1C):**
        *   First, **establish if the behavior was a physical cause** using the test above. If it was not, answer "No".
        *   If it *was* a cause, then apply the deviance test:
            *   If the behavior was a **deviant** violation of norms/policy that created the problem, it is the cause for attribution. Answer "Yes".
            *   If the behavior was **compliant, expected, and reasonable**, the cause is attributed to the background conditions or the deviant act of another. Answer "No".
        *   **Preemption Exception:** If a deviant action preempts a standard causal process, the deviant action is the cause. Necessary but non-deviant actions in the chain are not considered the primary cause for attribution.

**Example 1 (Action & Overdetermination - Physical Causation: Yes):**
- Outcome: Alex wins the game.
- Behavior: Alex spun the spinner (it landed on green).
- Causal Rules: Win if (dice > 2) OR (spinner green).
- Context: Dice and spin are simultaneous. Both conditions were met.
- Agency/Norms: Alex acted as required by the game.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Alex had not spun, the win would still have occurred (dice=12).
- Judgment (Physical): The spin produced a sufficient condition (green). Therefore, it is **a cause**.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Inaction & Overdetermination - Physical Causation: No):**
- Outcome: Clothes dried in sixty minutes.
- Behavior: David did not change the temperature setting.
- Causal Rules: Dries in 60 min if *either* MAX DRY *or* HIGH temp.
- Context: Both MAX DRY and HIGH temp were true.
- Agency/Norms: David checked and intentionally preserved the HIGH temp state.
- Counterfactual (Inaction): If David *had* changed the temp, the MAX DRY condition alone would still have caused the outcome.
- Judgment (Physical): The inaction did not change the fact that a sufficient condition (MAX DRY) was met. It was not a cause.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Action & Responsibility - Normative Attribution: No):**
- Outcome: Computer crashed.
- Behavior: Jane logged on at her permitted time (9:00 am).
- Causal Rules: Crashes if two users are logged in simultaneously.
- Context: A policy existed to prevent this. Lauren violated it by logging on at 9:00 am.
- Agency/Norms: Jane's action was compliant and expected. Lauren's was deviant.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Jane had not logged on, the crash would not have occurred.
- Judgment (Normative): Jane's action was a physical cause. However, it was compliant. The cause is attributed to Lauren's deviant action.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 (Simultaneous Login - Physical Causation: Yes):**
- Outcome: Emails were deleted.
- Behavior: Suzy logged into the central computer at 9 am.
- Causal Rules: Deletion occurs if two people log in simultaneously.
- Context: Company policy permitted both to log in at 9 am. The deletion risk was unknown.
- Agency/Norms: Suzy's action was compliant and expected.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Suzy had not logged in, only Billy would have logged in, the simultaneous condition would not have been met, and the deletion would not have occurred.
- Judgment (Physical): Suzy's action was a necessary part of the sufficient condition (two logins). It is a physical cause.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 5 (Pharmacist's Signature - Normative Attribution: No):**
- Outcome: Patient recovered.
- Behavior: The pharmacist signed off on the drug request (a routine check of inventory).
- Causal Rules: Recovery resulted from the drug, which required two signatures.
- Context: A hospital policy forbade this drug due to risks. The doctor knowingly violated this policy to sign off.
- Agency/Norms: Pharmacist's action was compliant and routine. Doctor's action was deviant.
- Counterfactual (Action): If the pharmacist had not signed, the drug would not have been administered.
- Judgment (Normative): The pharmacist's action was a physical cause. However, it was compliant and routine. The deviant doctor's action preempts the standard process and is the cause for attribution.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 6 (Intentionality - Mental State: No):**
- Question: "Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?"
- Outcome: Aunt died from a bullet to the heart.
- Behavior: Jake aimed and pulled the trigger, but his hand slipped.
- Desired Outcome: Jake intended to kill his aunt.
- Actual Outcome: The aunt was killed by a shot to the heart caused by a slip.
- Plan vs. Execution: Jake planned a well-aimed shot. The fatal shot to the heart was a result of an unplanned slip during execution.
- Specific Intent: Jake did not specifically intend the shot to land in the heart *as a result of a slip*; this specific manner was accidental.
- Judgment (Mental State): The outcome was intended (death) but the specific means (heart shot via slip) was not. Therefore, he did not shoot her in the heart intentionally.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 7 (Overdetermination & Physical Cause - Physical Causation: Yes):**
- Outcome: Motion detector went off.
- Behavior: Billy arrived at 9 am.
- Causal Rules: Detector triggers if *at least one person* is present.
- Context: Both Billy and Suzy were instructed to arrive at 9 am. They complied.
- Agency/Norms: Billy's action was compliant.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Billy had not arrived, Suzy's arrival alone would have triggered the detector (overdetermination).
- Judgment (Physical): Billy's arrival was part of a sufficient set of conditions (his presence + Suzy's presence). Under the revised physical causation rule, he is **a cause**.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 8 (Preemption of Inaction - Physical Causation: No) [NEW]:**
- Outcome: Machine broke down.
- Behavior: Kate did not put oil in the machine.
- Causal Rules: Machine breaks down if not oiled.
- Context: Janet was responsible for oiling; Kate was not. Janet forgot to oil.
- Agency/Norms: Kate's inaction was compliant with policy; she had no responsibility.
- Counterfactual (Inaction): If Kate had put oil in, the machine would not have broken down.
- Preemption Check: The lack of oil (and thus the breakdown) was already ensured by Janet's failure, which was independent of Kate's behavior. Janet's failure was a sufficient cause.
- Judgment (Physical): Kate's inaction is redundant and preempted. It is **not a cause**.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 9 (Contrastive Causation in Overdetermination - Physical Causation: Yes) [NEW]:**
- Outcome: Clothes dried in sixty minutes.
- Behavior: David did not change the temperature setting.
- Causal Rules: Dries in 60 min if *either* MAX DRY *or* HIGH temp.
- Context: Both MAX DRY and HIGH temp were true. David preserved the HIGH setting.
- Agency/Norms: David's action was compliant.
- Counterfactual (Inaction): If David had changed the temp, the outcome would still have occurred (due to MAX DRY).
- Actual Causal Process: Although overdetermined, the HIGH temperature was an active sufficient condition in the actual scenario. David's inaction preserved this condition.
- Judgment (Physical): The question is contrastive ("because David did not change"). David's inaction was part of the actual causal process by preserving a sufficient condition. It is **a cause**.

Answer questions about causal and intentional attribution by carefully analyzing the role of an agent's specific action or inaction. First, classify the primary focus of the question:

*   **Causal Attribution Question:** The question asks if the agent's behavior **was a cause** of the outcome. (e.g., "Did X cause Y?", "Was X responsible for Y?")
*   **Intentional Attribution Question:** The question asks if the agent **intended** the outcome or acted with purpose. (e.g., "Did X intentionally do Y?", "Did X mean to do Y?")

Then, follow the appropriate reasoning pathway.

### **PATHWAY 1: FOR CAUSAL ATTRIBUTION QUESTIONS**

**Follow these steps for questions about whether an action/inaction WAS A CAUSE of an outcome:**

1.  **Identify the Outcome and the Specific Agent Behavior:** State the outcome. Identify the precise action or inaction of the agent being questioned.
2.  **Identify the Causal Rules and Structure:** Determine the scenario's rules for the outcome. Classify the causal structure:
    *   **SUFFICIENT Cause (OR-gate):** The outcome occurs if A OR B OR C is true.
    *   **NECESSARY Cause (AND-gate):** The outcome occurs **only if** A AND B AND C are true.
    Note if multiple sufficient conditions exist (overdetermination).
3.  **Determine the Pre-existing Context:** Establish the state of the world before the agent's decision, including any relevant social norms, policies, or expected behaviors. Identify any *default* or *expected* processes that would lead to the outcome.
4.  **Analyze Agency and Norms:** Assess the agent's knowledge and intent. Determine if their behavior was compliant with rules and expectations or was a deviant act. For inaction, determine if it was a deliberate choice to *preserve* a state.
5.  **Apply the Dual Counterfactual Tests:**
    *   **For an ACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent did **NOT** perform the action. Would the outcome have been prevented? If yes, the action was a *necessary cause*.
    *   **For an INACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent **DID** act (performing the specific action they omitted). Would that action have prevented the outcome? If yes, the inaction was a *necessary cause*.
6.  **Make the Final Causal Judgment:**
    *   **For SUFFICIENT Causes (OR-gates):**
        *   If the agent's behavior **created** a new sufficient condition, it is **a cause**.
        *   If the agent's behavior **intentionally preserved** a pre-existing sufficient condition, it can be considered **a cause**.
        *   **However, in cases of overdetermination with default causes:** If the outcome would have been caused **anyway by a default, normal, or expected process**, and the agent's action was merely a redundant addition, then it is **not** considered the cause. The cause is attributed to the default process.
    *   **For NECESSARY Causes (AND-gates):**
        *   If the agent's behavior satisfied a necessary condition, it is **a cause**.
        *   **However, for questions using "because of":** If one necessary condition was highly improbable or required special effort, and the other was trivial or likely, the cause is typically attributed to the improbable condition.
    *   **For questions implying responsibility:** Even if a behavior was a cause, if it was **reasonable, expected, and compliant** with norms, the cause is attributed to the **deviant** action that created the problem.

**Causal Attribution Examples:**

**Example 1 (Action & Overdetermination - Answer: Yes):**
- Outcome: Alex wins the game.
- Behavior: Alex spun the spinner (it landed on green).
- Causal Rules: Win if (dice > 2) OR (spinner green). [SUFFICIENT/OR]
- Context: Dice and spin are simultaneous. Both conditions were met.
- Agency/Norms: Alex acted as required by the game.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Alex had not spun, the win would still have occurred (dice=12).
- Judgment: The spin produced a sufficient condition (green). Therefore, it is **a cause**.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Inaction & Overdetermination - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Clothes dried in sixty minutes.
- Behavior: David did not change the temperature setting.
- Causal Rules: Dries in 60 min if *either* MAX DRY *or* HIGH temp. [SUFFICIENT/OR]
- Context: Both MAX DRY and HIGH temp were true. MAX DRY was the active, sufficient state.
- Agency/Norms: David checked and intentionally preserved the HIGH temp state.
- Counterfactual (Inaction): If David *had* changed the temp, the MAX DRY condition alone would still have caused the outcome.
- Judgment: The inaction did not change the fact that a sufficient condition (MAX DRY) was met. It was not a cause.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Action & Responsibility - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Computer crashed.
- Behavior: Jane logged on at her permitted time (9:00 am).
- Causal Rules: Crashes if two users are logged in simultaneously. [NECESSARY/AND for the crash]
- Context: A policy existed to prevent this. Lauren violated it by logging on at 9:00 am.
- Agency/Norms: Jane's action was compliant and expected. Lauren's was deviant.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Jane had not logged on, the crash would not have occurred.
- Judgment: While Jane's login was a necessary physical condition, the cause is attributed to Lauren's deviant action that violated the policy and created the crash condition.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 (Necessary Cause & "Because of" - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Alex wins the game.
- Behavior: Alex flipped the coin (it came up heads).
- Causal Rules: Win **only if** (dice > 11) **AND** (coin = heads). [NECESSARY/AND]
- Context: The dice roll was highly improbable; the coin flip was 50/50.
- Agency/Norms: Alex acted as required.
- Counterfactual (Action): If the coin had not come up heads, Alex would not have won.
- Judgment: While the coin flip was a necessary condition, the win is attributed to the improbable dice roll for the purpose of "because of". The coin flip was a prerequisite, not the explanatory cause.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 (Overdetermination with Defaults - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Coffee shop made a profit.
- Behavior: Drew ordered coffee.
- Causal Rules: Profit if **anyone** orders coffee. [SUFFICIENT/OR]
- Context: Kylie and Oliver *usually* order and *did* order. Their orders were the default, expected cause.
- Agency/Norms: Drew's action was unexpected but not deviant.
- Counterfactual (Action): If Drew had not ordered, the profit would still have occurred due to Kylie and Oliver.
- Judgment: The profit was guaranteed by the default process. Drew's redundant action is not considered the cause.

### **PATHWAY 2: FOR INTENTIONAL ATTRIBUTION QUESTIONS**

**Follow these steps for questions about whether an agent INTENDED an outcome:**

1.  **Identify the Outcome and the Specific Agent Behavior:** State the outcome in question. Identify the agent's precise action.
2.  **Determine the Agent's Goals, Beliefs, and Desires:**
    *   What was the agent's **primary goal or desire**?
    *   What did the agent **know or believe** at the time of acting? Was the outcome seen as **certain**, **likely**, or just **possible**?
    *   What was the agent's **attitude** towards the outcome? Did they **want** it to happen, **not care**, or want to **avoid** it?
3.  **Analyze the Role of the Outcome in the Agent's Plan:**
    *   **Means to an End:** Was the outcome a necessary **step** or **method** used to achieve the primary goal? (e.g., pulling the trigger to fire the bullet).
    *   **Component of the Goal:** Was the outcome a **part of the goal itself**? (e.g., the enemy commander being dead).
    *   **Foreseen Side-Effect:** Was the outcome a **byproduct** of the action that is not a means to the goal and not itself desired? (e.g., the eagle flying away, air molecules disturbing).
4.  **Apply the Test of Intentionality:**
    *   If the outcome was **a means to an end or a component of the goal**, then the agent **intended** it.
    *   If the outcome was **a foreseen side-effect**:
        *   The agent **intended** it **only if** they had a **positive desire** for it to happen (e.g., they were glad about it).
        *   If the agent was **indifferent** ("did not care") or **wanted to avoid** the side-effect, then they **did not intend** it, even if they knew it was certain.
        *   **Exception for Trivial/Inevitable Consequences:** If the outcome is a trivial, automatic, or physically inevitable consequence of the action (e.g., disturbing air molecules, creating sound waves, casting a shadow), it is **never** considered intended unless it is the specific goal. These are considered part of the action's basic physics, not a separate intended outcome.
5.  **Make the Final Intentionality Judgment:** Base your judgment on whether the outcome was a means/component of the plan and desired, not solely on foresight or certainty.

**Intentional Attribution Examples:**

**Example 6 (Intended Means - Answer: Yes):**
- Outcome: The enemy commander was killed.
- Behavior: The sniper pulled the trigger.
- Goals/Desires: Primary goal was to kill the commander.
- Role in Plan: The death was the **component of the goal itself**.
- Judgment: The agent intended the outcome.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 7 (Certain but Unwanted Side-Effect - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: The eagle flew away.
- Behavior: The hunter shot the deer.
- Goals/Desires: Primary goal was to win by killing the deer. He was indifferent to the eagle ("did not care").
- Role in Plan: The eagle flying away was a **foreseen side-effect**. It was not a means to the goal.
- Test of Intentionality: The agent was indifferent to this certain side-effect.
- Judgment: Therefore, he **did not intend** it.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 8 (Risky Harm - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: A pedestrian was hit by a car.
- Behavior: A driver sped through a neighborhood.
- Goals/Desires: Goal was to get home quickly. He knew speeding created a **risk**.
- Role in Plan: Hitting the pedestrian was a **foreseen possibility**, not a certainty.
- Test of Intentionality: The outcome was not certain from the agent's perspective.
- Judgment: Therefore, he did not intend it (though he was reckless).
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 9 (Trivial/Inevitable Consequence - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Disturbed air molecules.
- Behavior: The sniper pulled the trigger.
- Goals/Desires: Primary goal was to kill the commander. The air molecules were irrelevant.
- Role in Plan: Disturbing molecules is a **trivial and inevitable physical consequence** of firing a bullet.
- Test of Intentionality: The outcome is too trivial and inevitable to be considered intended.
- Judgment: The agent did not intend it.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 10 (Desired Side-Effect - Answer: Yes):**
- Outcome: A valuable stained-glass window shattered.
- Behavior: A guard sounded a fire alarm.
- Goals/Desires: Primary goal was to warn the town. He hated the window and was glad it would break.
- Role in Plan: The shattering was a **foreseen side-effect**.
- Test of Intentionality: The agent had a **positive desire** for this side-effect.
- Judgment: Therefore, he intended it.
<answer>Yes</answer>

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying counterfactual reasoning with normative context. Follow these steps carefully:

1.  **Identify the proposed cause and the outcome.**
    -   Pay close attention to how the cause is phrased. If it is a negative event or an inaction (e.g., "did not change," "was absent"), the counterfactual will involve its positive counterpart (e.g., "did change," "was present").
    -   Separate an *agent's action or inaction* from the resulting *state of the world*.

2.  **Assess the normative context:** Identify relevant policies, rules, social norms, or default expectations. Determine which events were *permitted, expected, and normal* and which were *forbidden, unexpected, or abnormal*.

3.  **Construct a counterfactual scenario:** Imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur (or, for an inaction, imagine the agent DID perform the action). **Crucially, hold all normal, expected, and permitted conditions fixed.** Do not hold abnormal or forbidden violations fixed.

4.  **Determine if the outcome would still have occurred in this counterfactual scenario:**
    -   If the outcome would NOT have occurred, then the proposed cause is a necessary factor.
    -   If the outcome would still have occurred, then the proposed cause is not necessary.

5.  **Apply the Final Attribution Rule:** Even if the proposed cause is a necessary factor, if it was a *normal or permitted* action/inaction and the outcome would only have been prevented by an *abnormal or forbidden* change in the counterfactual, then the proposed cause is **not** considered the decisive causal factor. Answer "No".

6.  **For events requiring multiple conditions (e.g., A AND B must occur),** remember that EACH condition is necessary. The absence of any necessary condition prevents the outcome.

7.  **Ignore the likelihood or probability of events.** Focus on the dependency and normative context.

8.  **In cases of overdetermination (where multiple sufficient causes exist),** the outcome does not depend on any single cause. If the outcome would have occurred even without the proposed cause, answer "No".

9.  **Special Rule for Omissions:** For a cause phrased as an inaction (e.g., "did not do X"), the counterfactual is that the agent *does* perform the action. If performing that action would have changed the outcome, then the inaction was necessary. Apply the Final Attribution Rule (Step 5) to omissions as well.

**Examples of correct reasoning:**

**Example A:**
**Question:** Joe wins if he gets green from left AND blue from right. He got both. Did getting green cause the win?
**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is "getting green." There is no normative context provided, so we proceed with standard counterfactual reasoning. Counterfactual: If Joe had not gotten green (but still got blue), he would not have won because both are required. The outcome would not have occurred.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example B:**
**Question:** The climate system turns on if travel agents OR design agents arrive. Both arrived. Did design agents cause the system to turn on?
**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is "design agents arriving." No normative context. Counterfactual: If design agents had not arrived (but travel agents still did), the system would still have turned on. The outcome would still have occurred.
**Answer:** No

**Example C:**
**Question:** Ned has a new motorboat. It starts if gear is neutral OR motor is in lock. Both are true. Ned did not change the motor's position. Did the boat start because Ned did not change it?
**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is "Ned did not change the motor's position," an *inaction*. No policy is mentioned, so we assume no normative context. Counterfactual: Imagine Ned *had* changed the position (moving the motor out of lock). The gear is still neutral. The boat would still start. The outcome would still have occurred. The inaction was not necessary.
**Answer:** No

**Example D: [New example to address normative context]**
**Question:** Billy (not permitted) and Suzy (permitted) log in at the same time, causing a deletion. Did Suzy cause the deletion?
**Reasoning:**
-   **Step 1:** Proposed cause: Suzy logging in. Outcome: Deletion.
-   **Step 2 (Normative Context):** Company policy is the norm. Suzy logging in at 9 am is **permitted and expected**. Billy logging in at 9 am is **forbidden and abnormal**.
-   **Step 3 (Counterfactual):** Imagine Suzy did *not* log in. We hold normal conditions fixed: Billy should not be logging in. The most similar world is one where the policy is followed (Billy does not log in either). In this world, no deletion occurs.
-   **Step 4:** The outcome would NOT have occurred. Suzy's login is a necessary factor.
-   **Step 5 (Final Attribution):** Suzy's action was *normal and permitted*. Preventing the outcome required no abnormal changes (the policy was simply followed). Therefore, her necessary action is not considered the decisive cause. The cause is Billy's abnormal violation.
**Answer:** No

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying counterfactual reasoning. Follow these steps carefully:

**Step 0: Determine the Question's Frame**
-   First, identify whether the question is primarily about:
    -   **Physical Causation:** The mechanistic chain of events that produced the outcome.
    -   **Normative Causation:** Whether a violation of rules, norms, or expectations was the decisive cause.
-   Look for clues like "was not allowed," "did not know," or "accidentally," which often signal a normative frame.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposed Cause and the Outcome.**
-   Pay close attention to how the cause is phrased. If it is a negative event or an inaction (e.g., "did not change," "was absent"), the counterfactual will involve its positive counterpart (e.g., "did change," "was present").
-   Separate an *agent's action or inaction* from the resulting *state of the world*.

**Step 2: Construct the Primary Counterfactual Scenario**
-   Imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur (or, for an inaction, imagine the agent DID perform the action), but all other conditions remain as similar as possible to the original situation.

**Step 3: Apply the Necessity Test**
-   Would the outcome have still occurred in this counterfactual scenario?
    -   If **NO**, then the proposed cause is a necessary factor. Proceed to answer "Yes".
    -   If **YES**, proceed to Step 4.

**Step 4: Apply the Actual Causation Test (For Physical Frames)**
-   Even if the outcome would have occurred later, **was the proposed cause the actual, operative event that directly brought about the outcome *at the specific time it occurred*?**
    -   If **YES** (e.g., it pre-empted a later, potential cause), then answer "Yes".
    -   If **NO** (e.g., the outcome was simultaneously overdetermined by multiple sufficient causes), then answer "No".

**Step 5: Apply the Normative Test (For Normative Frames)**
-   If the question is framed normatively (from Step 0), construct this special counterfactual: "If all agents had followed the rules and acted as expected, would the outcome have occurred?"
    -   If the outcome would **NOT** have occurred, then the norm-violating action was the cause. Answer "Yes".
    -   If the outcome **WOULD** have occurred anyway, then the norm-violating action was not the cause. Answer "No".

**Step 6: General Rules to Remember**
-   **Overdetermination (True):** Only exists if multiple sufficient causes occurred **simultaneously and independently**. The absence of any single one would not have prevented the outcome.
-   **Pre-emption:** Occurs when one cause actually brings about the outcome, thereby preventing another potential cause from doing so. The pre-empting cause is causal.
-   **Ignore Probabilities:** Focus only on the logical dependency revealed by the counterfactual, not how likely events are.
-   **Omissions:** For a cause phrased as an inaction, the counterfactual is that the agent *does* perform the action. If performing that action would have changed the outcome, then the inaction was necessary.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example A:**
**Question:** Joe wins if he gets green from left AND blue from right. He got both. Did getting green cause the win?
**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is "getting green." Counterfactual: If Joe had not gotten green (but still got blue), he would not have won because both are required. The outcome would not have occurred.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example B:**
**Question:** The climate system turns on if travel agents OR design agents arrive. Both arrived. Did design agents cause the system to turn on?
**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is "design agents arriving." Counterfactual: If design agents had not arrived (but travel agents still did), the system would still have turned on. The outcome would still have occurred.
**Answer:** No

**Example C: (Demonstrating Pre-emption)**
**Question:** [John's Death Story]
**Reasoning:**
*   **Frame:** Physical/medical causation.
*   **Cause:** Misadministration of medication. **Outcome:** Death at that moment.
*   **Necessity Test (Step 3):** Without the error, would John have died at that exact moment? No, he would have died later from cancer. The outcome (death at time T) would not have occurred.
*   **Actual Causation Test (Step 4):** The drug error was the actual, operative event that directly caused death at the time it happened. It pre-empted the cancer.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example D: (Demonstrating Normative Test)**
**Question:** [The Hedgehog Story]
**Reasoning:**
*   **Frame (Step 0):** Normative. The story emphasizes a rule ("hedgehogs were not allowed").
*   **Cause:** The hedgehog taking pencils. **Outcome:** No pencils for the polar bear.
*   **Normative Test (Step 5):** If everyone had followed the rules (hedgehog takes 0, bear takes 7), would the outcome have occurred? The story implies the bear's permitted actions were sufficient to use all pencils, so the outcome would have occurred anyway. The hedgehog's violation was not the decisive cause.

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying counterfactual reasoning. Follow these steps carefully:

**0. Classify the Question:**
- If the question asks about **causal necessity** (e.g., "Did X cause Y?", "Was X necessary for Y?"), proceed to Step 1.
- If the question asks about **intentional causation** (e.g., "Did X intentionally cause Y?", "Did X mean to cause Y?"), you must consider both causal necessity *and* the agent's intention. Proceed through all steps, then apply the **Intentionality Analysis** (Step 8).
- If the question is about other concepts (e.g., moral blameworthiness), note that this framework may not be fully sufficient.

1.  **Identify the proposed cause and the outcome.**
    -   Pay close attention to how the cause is phrased. If it is a negative event or an inaction (e.g., "did not change," "was absent"), the counterfactual will involve its positive counterpart (e.g., "did change," "was present").
    -   Separate an *agent's action or inaction* from the resulting *state of the world*.

2.  **Construct a counterfactual scenario:** Imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur (or, for an inaction, imagine the agent DID perform the action), but all other conditions remain as similar as possible to the original situation.

3.  **Determine if the outcome would still have occurred in this counterfactual scenario:**
    -   If the outcome would NOT have occurred, then the proposed cause is a necessary causal factor.
    -   If the outcome would still have occurred, then the proposed cause is not a necessary causal factor.

4.  **For events requiring multiple conditions (e.g., A AND B must occur),** remember that EACH condition is necessary. The absence of any necessary condition prevents the outcome.

5.  **Ignore the objective likelihood or probability of external events.** However, you **must** consider the agent's subjective knowledge, beliefs, and desires as stated in the scenario when analyzing questions of intention.

6.  **In cases of overdetermination (where multiple sufficient causes exist),** the outcome does not depend on any single cause. If the outcome would have occurred even without the proposed cause, then the proposed cause is not necessary.

7.  **Special Rule for Omissions:** For a cause phrased as an inaction (e.g., "did not do X"), the counterfactual is that the agent *does* perform the action. If performing that action would have changed the outcome, then the inaction was necessary. If the outcome would have been the same regardless, then the inaction was not necessary.

8.  **Intentionality Analysis (if required by question classification):**
    -   A necessary causal relationship (established in Step 3) is a prerequisite for intentional causation, but it is not sufficient.
    -   Review the scenario for evidence of the agent's **goals and desires**. The key question is: Did the agent perform the action *with the goal or purpose* of bringing about the outcome?
    -   If the outcome was a **foreseen but undesired side effect** of an action taken for a different purpose, then the agent did *not* intentionally cause it.
    -   If the outcome was the direct goal of the action, then the agent *did* intentionally cause it.

**Examples of correct reasoning:**

**Example A:**
**Question:** Joe wins if he gets green from left AND blue from right. He got both. Did getting green cause the win?
**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is "getting green." Counterfactual: If Joe had not gotten green (but still got blue), he would not have won because both are required. The outcome would not have occurred.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example B:**
**Question:** The climate system turns on if travel agents OR design agents arrive. Both arrived. Did design agents cause the system to turn on?
**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is "design agents arriving." Counterfactual: If design agents had not arrived (but travel agents still did), the system would still have turned on. The outcome would still have occurred.
**Answer:** No

**Example C:**
**Question:** Ned has a new motorboat. It starts if gear is neutral OR motor is in lock. Both are true. Ned did not change the motor's position. Did the boat start because Ned did not change it?
**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is "Ned did not change the motor's position," an *inaction*. Counterfactual: Imagine Ned *had* changed the position (moving the motor out of lock). The gear is still neutral. The boat would still start (because gear is neutral is a sufficient condition). The outcome would still have occurred. Applying Rule 7, the inaction was not necessary.
**Answer:** No

**Example D: [Intentionality Analysis]**
**Question:** The hunter shot the deer, and the gunfire caused an eagle to fly away. The hunter knew this would happen but did not care. Did the hunter intentionally cause the eagle to fly away?
**Reasoning:**
-   *Causal Necessity (Steps 1-3):* The proposed cause is "the hunter shot the deer." The outcome is "the eagle flew away." Counterfactual: If the hunter had not shot, there would be no gunfire, and the eagle would not have flown away. The action was a necessary cause.
-   *Intentionality Analysis (Step 8):* The hunter's goal was to kill the deer to win the competition. The eagle flying away was a known but undesired side effect of this goal. He did not act with the purpose of making the eagle fly away.

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying counterfactual reasoning. Follow these steps carefully:

**Step 0: Determine the Question's Frame**
-   First, identify whether the question is primarily about:
    -   **Physical Causation:** The mechanistic chain of events that produced the outcome.
    -   **Normative Causation:** Whether a violation of explicit rules, norms, or expectations was the decisive cause.
    -   **Functional/Design-Based Causation:** Whether the outcome resulted from a deviation from the intended design, purpose, or default operation of a system. Look for clues like "supposed to," "designed to," or "normally."
    -   **Attributive Causation:** Which factor was most decisive, surprising, or unlikely in bringing about the outcome, especially when multiple necessary factors are present. Look for clues like "was very unlikely," "was likely," or "surprisingly."
-   Keywords like "was not allowed," "did not know," "accidentally," **"supposed to," "designed to," "it is likely,"** or **"it is unlikely"** often signal a non-purely-physical frame.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposed Cause and the Outcome.**
-   Pay close attention to how the cause is phrased. If it is a negative event or an inaction (e.g., "did not change," "was absent"), the counterfactual will involve its positive counterpart (e.g., "did change," "was present").
-   Separate an *agent's action or inaction* from the resulting *state of the world*.

**Step 2: Construct the Primary Counterfactual Scenario**
-   Imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur (or, for an inaction, imagine the agent DID perform the action), but all other conditions remain as similar as possible to the original situation.

**Step 3: Apply the Necessity Test**
-   Would the outcome have still occurred in this counterfactual scenario?
    -   If **NO**, then the proposed cause is a necessary factor. Proceed to Step 4.
    -   If **YES**, then the proposed cause is not necessary. Answer "No".

**Step 4: Apply the Default/Deviant Test for Conjunctive Causes**
-   **If the cause is necessary (from Step 3), but other events were also necessary, you MUST check this step.**
-   Determine if the proposed cause was the **normal, expected, or default** state of affairs within the context of the question.
-   Determine if the outcome was actually brought about by a **deviant, abnormal, unexpected, or surprising** action of *another* agent or component.
    -   If **YES**, then the proposed cause, while logically necessary, is **not** considered the salient "cause" for attribution purposes. Answer "No".
    -   If **NO**, then proceed to answer "Yes".

**Step 5: Apply the Actual Causation Test (For Purely Physical Frames)**
-   **Only use this step if the frame is purely Physical (from Step 0) and Step 4 does not apply.**
-   Even if the outcome would have occurred later, **was the proposed cause the actual, operative event that directly brought about the outcome *at the specific time it occurred*?**
    -   If **YES** (e.g., it pre-empted a later, potential cause), then answer "Yes".
    -   If **NO** (e.g., the outcome was simultaneously overdetermined by multiple sufficient causes), then answer "No".

**Step 6: Apply the Normative/Functional Test (For Non-Physical Frames)**
-   **If the question is framed normatively, functionally, or attributively (from Step 0):**
    -   **Construct this special counterfactual:** "If all agents and components had followed the rules, design specifications, or expected/probable behavior, would the outcome have occurred?"
    -   If the outcome would **NOT** have occurred, then the rule-violating or deviant action was the cause. Answer "Yes" for a proposed cause that is deviant.
    -   If the outcome **WOULD** have occurred anyway, then the rule-violating or deviant action was not the cause. Answer "No" for a proposed cause that is deviant.
    -   **For a proposed cause that is the *default*:** If the outcome would have occurred under normal conditions, then the default action is not the cause. Answer "No".

**Step 7: General Rules to Remember**
-   **Overdetermination (True):** Only exists if multiple sufficient causes occurred **simultaneously and independently**. The absence of any single one would not have prevented the outcome.
-   **Pre-emption:** Occurs when one cause actually brings about the outcome, thereby preventing another potential cause from doing so. The pre-empting cause is causal.
-   **Use Probabilities for Attribution, Not for Logic:** When constructing the counterfactual scenario (Step 2), ignore probabilities to determine logical dependency. However, **use information about likelihood and expectation** to determine the question's frame (Step 0) and to apply the Default/Deviant Test (Step 4).
-   **Omissions:** For a cause phrased as an inaction, the counterfactual is that the agent *does* perform the action. If performing that action would have changed the outcome, then the inaction was necessary.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example A: (Basic Conjunction)**
**Question:** Joe wins if he gets green from left AND blue from right. He got both. Did getting green cause the win?
**Reasoning:** Physical frame. Cause is necessary. It is not established that getting green was a default or that getting blue was a deviant surprise. No reason to invoke Step 4.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example B: (Basic Disjunction)**
**Question:** The climate system turns on if travel agents OR design agents arrive. Both arrived. Did design agents cause the system to turn on?
**Reasoning:** Physical frame. Cause is not necessary (Step 3). If design agents had not come, travel agents would have turned it on.
**Answer:** No

**Example C: (Demonstrating Pre-emption)**
**Question:** [John's Death Story]
**Reasoning:**
*   **Frame:** Physical/medical causation.
*   **Cause:** Misadministration of medication. **Outcome:** Death at that moment.
*   **Necessity Test (Step 3):** Without the error, would John have died at that exact moment? No.
*   **Step 4/5:** The error was the deviant, operative event that pre-empted the cancer.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example D: (Demonstrating Normative Test)**
**Question:** [The Hedgehog Story]
**Reasoning:**
*   **Frame (Step 0):** Normative. The story emphasizes a rule ("hedgehogs were not allowed").
*   **Cause:** The hedgehog taking pencils. **Outcome:** No pencils for the polar bear.
*   **Normative Test (Step 6):** If everyone had followed the rules, the bear would have taken all pencils. Outcome would have occurred anyway.
**Answer:** No

**Example E: (Machine Short Circuit - Failure Case Fixed)**
**Question:** A machine is set up so it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery... The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery... Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the short circuit?
**Reasoning:**
*   **Frame (Step 0):** Functional/Design-Based. The black wire is "supposed to" touch; this is its default state. The red wire is not.
*   **Necessity Test (Step 3):** If the black wire had not touched, no short circuit. It is necessary.
*   **Default/Deviant Test (Step 4):** The black wire touching was the *default, expected* state. The short circuit was caused by the *deviant* event (the red wire touching). Therefore, the proposed cause (black wire) is not the salient cause.
**Answer:** No

**Example F: (Casino Game - Failure Case Fixed)**
**Question:** ...It is likely that he gets a green ball from the first box. It is very unlikely that he gets a blue ball in the second box... Did Joe's first choice cause him to win?
**Reasoning:**
*   **Frame (Step 0):** Attributive. The narrative establishes a probabilistic expectation ("likely" vs. "very unlikely").
*   **Necessity Test (Step 3):** Without the green ball, no win. It is necessary.
*   **Default/Deviant Test (Step 4):** Getting the green ball was the *likely, expected* outcome. Winning was caused by the *surprising, unlikely* event (getting the blue ball). Therefore, the proposed cause (first choice) is not the decisive cause.
**Answer:** No

    -   Pay close attention to how the cause is phrased. If it is a negative event or an inaction (e.g., "did not change," "was absent"), the counterfactual will involve its positive counterpart (e.g., "did change," "was present").
    -   Separate an *agent's action or inaction* from the resulting *state of the world*.
    -   **Consider if the proposed cause is part of a chain of events. Identify if there are any *deviant* or *intervening* actions by other agents that might be the more direct cause of the outcome.**

**2.  **Construct a counterfactual scenario:** Imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur (or, for an inaction, imagine the agent DID perform the action), but all other conditions remain as similar as possible to the original situation. **For actions, hold the actions of other agents constant unless the scenario logically requires them to change.**

**3.  **Determine if the outcome would still have occurred in this counterfactual scenario:**
    -   If the outcome would NOT have occurred, then the proposed cause is a necessary causal factor (a "cause-in-fact").
    -   If the outcome would still have occurred, then the proposed cause is not a necessary causal factor.

**4.  **For events requiring multiple conditions (e.g., A AND B must occur),** remember that EACH condition is necessary. The absence of any necessary condition prevents the outcome.

**5.  **For Symmetric Overdetermination (Multiple Sufficient Causes):** If multiple sufficient causes occurred simultaneously (e.g., two trains, each heavy enough to collapse a bridge, hit it at the same time), **AND the outcome would have occurred even without the proposed cause, then the proposed cause is not necessary. However, note that in such cases, all simultaneous sufficient causes are often considered contributory causes in everyday language.** The final answer may depend on the specific phrasing of the question.

**6.  **Assess Explanatory Salience (Critical New Step):** A condition can be necessary but not explanatory.
    -   **Consider the normality and probability of events as stated in the scenario.** A cause is often the *abnormal* or *unexpected* factor that made the difference.
    -   If the outcome required two events (A and B), and one event (A) was highly probable or normal, while the other (B) was highly improbable or deviant, then the outcome is typically attributed to B. We say it happened "because of B," not "because of A."
    -   **Example:** A win requires a coin flip (heads) AND a dice roll (>11). The coin flip is normal (50/50). The dice roll is abnormal (very unlikely). Therefore, the win is attributed to the dice roll, not the coin flip. The coin flip is a necessary background condition, but not the salient cause.

**7.  **Special Rule for Omissions:** For a cause phrased as an inaction (e.g., "did not do X"), the counterfactual is that the agent *does* perform the action. If performing that action would have changed the outcome, then the inaction was necessary. If the outcome would have been the same regardless, then the inaction was not necessary.

**8.  **Ignore the objective likelihood or probability of external events *that are not part of the described scenario*.** However, you **must** consider the agent's subjective knowledge, beliefs, and desires as stated in the scenario when analyzing questions of intention. **You MUST also consider the stated probabilities and normalities of events *within* the scenario for assessing explanatory salience (Step 6).**

**9.  **Intentionality Analysis (if required by question classification):**
    -   A necessary causal relationship (established in Step 3) is a prerequisite for intentional causation, but it is not sufficient.
    -   Review the scenario for evidence of the agent's **goals and desires**. The key question is: Did the agent perform the action *with the goal or purpose* of bringing about the outcome?
    -   If the outcome was a **foreseen but undesired side effect** of an action taken for a different purpose, then the agent did *not* intentionally cause it.
    -   If the outcome was the direct goal of the action, then the agent *did* intentionally cause it.

**Examples of correct reasoning:**

**Example A:**
**Question:** Joe wins if he gets green from left AND blue from right. He got both. Did getting green cause the win?
**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is "getting green." Counterfactual: If Joe had not gotten green (but still got blue), he would not have won because both are required. The outcome would not have occurred.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example B:**
**Question:** The climate system turns on if travel agents OR design agents arrive. Both arrived. Did design agents cause the system to turn on?
**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is "design agents arriving." Counterfactual: If design agents had not arrived (but travel agents still did), the system would still have turned on. The outcome would still have occurred.
**Answer:** No

**Example C:**
**Question:** Ned has a new motorboat. It starts if gear is neutral OR motor is in lock. Both are true. Ned did not change the motor's position. Did the boat start because Ned did not change it?
**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is "Ned did not change the motor's position," an *inaction*. Counterfactual: Imagine Ned *had* changed the position (moving the motor out of lock). The gear is still neutral. The boat would still start (because gear is neutral is a sufficient condition). The outcome would still have occurred. Applying Rule 7, the inaction was not necessary.
**Answer:** No

**Example D: [Intentionality Analysis]**
**Question:** The hunter shot the deer, and the gunfire caused an eagle to fly away. The hunter knew this would happen but did not care. Did the hunter intentionally cause the eagle to fly away?
**Reasoning:**
-   *Causal Necessity (Steps 1-3):* The proposed cause is "the hunter shot the deer." The outcome is "the eagle flew away." Counterfactual: If the hunter had not shot, there would be no gunfire, and the eagle would not have flown away. The action was a necessary cause.
-   *Intentionality Analysis (Step 9):* The hunter's goal was to kill the deer to win the competition. The eagle flying away was a known but undesired side effect of this goal. He did not act with the purpose of making the eagle fly away.
**Answer:** No

**Example E: [Explanatory Salience - Failure Case from Example 4]**
**Question:** Alex will only win the game if the total of his dice roll is greater than 11 AND the coin comes up heads. It is very unlikely that he will roll higher than 11, but the coin has equal odds of coming up heads or tails. Alex flips the coin and rolls his dice at exactly the same time. The coin comes up heads, and he rolls a 12, so amazingly, he rolled greater than 11. Alex wins the game. Did Alex win because of the coin flip?
**Reasoning:**
-   *Steps 1-3:* The proposed cause is "the coin comes up heads." The outcome is "winning." Counterfactual: If the coin had not come up heads (i.e., it was tails), Alex would not have won, even with a roll of 12. The coin flip is a necessary condition.
-   *Step 6 (Explanatory Salience):* The win required two conditions. The dice roll (>11) was highly improbable ("very unlikely," "amazingly"). The coin flip was a normal, 50/50 event. The salient, explanatory cause of the win is the abnormal dice roll, not the normal coin flip. Therefore, Alex did not win *because of* the coin flip.
**Answer:** No

**Example F: [Symmetric Overdetermination & Deviant Action - Failure Cases from Examples 1 & 3]**
**Question 1 (Gardeners):** Did the fertilization by Alex cause the plant to dry out?
**Reasoning:**
-   *Steps 1-3:* The proposed cause is "Alex fertilized with A X200R." Counterfactual: If Alex had not fertilized, there would be no combination of chemicals, and the plants would not have dried. His action is a necessary condition.
-   *Step 1 (Precision):* The true, direct cause of the drying is the *combination* of A and B. Alex followed instructions correctly. Benni's action (using the forbidden B Y33R) was a deviant, intervening cause that broke the expected causal chain. The outcome is not attributed to Alex's standard action but to Benni's deviant one.
**Answer:** No

**Question 2 (Trains):** Did Billy cause the bridge to collapse?
**Reasoning:**
-   *Steps 1-3 & 5 (Overdetermination):* The proposed cause is "Billy driving his train." Counterfactual: If Billy had not driven, Suzy's train alone would have caused the collapse. The outcome would still have occurred. By strict necessity, Billy's action is not necessary.
-   *Step 5 (Symmetric Overdetermination Note):* However, both trains hit the bridge simultaneously. In this symmetric case, both actions are contributory causes to the actual outcome that occurred. The question "Did Billy cause..." is answered affirmatively in this context, as his train was part of the actual sufficient set that collapsed the bridge.
**Answer:** Yes

Answer questions about causal attribution and intentionality by applying counterfactual reasoning with normative context. Follow these steps carefully:

1.  **Identify the Question Type:**
    -   **Event Causation:** Questions like "Did X cause Y?" Focus on events and outcomes.
    -   **Agent Intentionality:** Questions like "Did A intentionally do X?" Focus on actions and mental states.
    -   **If the question is about intentionality, skip to Step 5B.**

2.  **For Event Causation: Identify the proposed cause and the outcome.**
    -   Pay close attention to phrasing. If the cause is a negative event or an inaction (e.g., "did not change"), the counterfactual involves its positive counterpart (e.g., "did change").
    -   Separate an *agent's action or inaction* from the resulting *state of the world*.

3.  **Assess the Normative Context:** Identify relevant policies, rules, social norms, or default expectations. Determine which *types of actions or events* were *permitted, expected, and normal* and which were *forbidden, unexpected, or abnormal*.
    -   **Crucial Note:** A specific outcome of a random process (e.g., a coin landing heads, a die showing six) is not itself "abnormal" if the process is normal and all possible outcomes are permitted.

4.  **Construct the Counterfactual Scenario:**
    -   Imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur (or, for an inaction, imagine the agent DID perform the action).
    -   **Hold all normal, expected, and permitted *actions and background conditions* fixed.** Do not hold fixed any abnormal or forbidden violations that occurred in the original scenario. **Only change the specific event mentioned in the cause.**

5.  **Determine Dependency:**
    -   If the outcome would NOT have occurred in this counterfactual, the proposed cause is a **necessary factor**.
    -   If the outcome would still have occurred, the proposed cause is **not necessary**.

6.  **Apply the Attribution Rules for Event Causation (Rule A):**
    -   **If the cause was not necessary,** answer "No".
    -   **If the cause was necessary,** answer "Yes" **unless** the following exception applies:
        -   **Exception:** The cause was a *normal or permitted* action/inaction, and the *only reason* it was necessary was that you were artificially holding fixed an *abnormal or forbidden* violation in the counterfactual. In this case, answer "No".

7.  **Rule for Agent Intentionality (Rule B):**
    -   An agent intentionally φ-ed (e.g., "rolled a six") if: (1) they intended to bring about φ, (2) they performed an action aimed at bringing about φ, and (3) their action successfully resulted in φ.
    -   If all three conditions are met, answer "Yes". Do not perform a counterfactual test on the agent's intention itself.

8.  **Handling Multiple Causes:**
    -   **For necessary conditions (AND):** All are causes. Answer "Yes" for each necessary condition that occurred.
    -   **For sufficient conditions (OR):** If multiple sufficient causes are present (overdetermination), **each one that occurred is still considered a cause.** Answer "Yes" for each sufficient cause that occurred, unless the exception in Rule A applies.

9.  **Ignore the likelihood or probability of events.** Focus on dependency and normative context.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example A: (Necessary Condition)**
**Question:** Joe wins if he gets green from left AND blue from right. He got both. Did getting green cause the win?
**Reasoning:** Event causation. Cause: getting green. Outcome: win. No special normative context. Counterfactual: If Joe had not gotten green (but blue is held fixed), he would not have won. The cause is necessary. Rule A: No exception applies.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example B: (Overdetermination)**
**Question:** The climate system turns on if travel agents OR design agents arrive. Both arrived. Did design agents cause the system to turn on?
**Reasoning:** Event causation. Cause: design agents arriving. Outcome: system on. Counterfactual: If design agents had not arrived (travel agents held fixed), the system would still turn on. The cause is not necessary. Rule A: Answer "No".
**Answer:** No

**Example C: (Inaction)**
**Question:** Ned has a new motorboat. It starts if gear is neutral OR motor is in lock. Both are true. Ned did not change the motor's position. Did the boat start because Ned did not change it?
**Reasoning:** Event causation. Cause: Ned's inaction. Outcome: boat starts. Counterfactual: Imagine Ned *had* changed the position. The gear is still neutral (held fixed), so the boat would still start. The outcome would still have occurred. The inaction was not necessary.
**Answer:** No

**Example D: (Normative Context - Abnormal Violation)**
**Question:** Billy (not permitted) and Suzy (permitted) log in at the same time, causing a deletion. Did Suzy cause the deletion?
**Reasoning:** Event causation. Cause: Suzy logging in. Outcome: deletion. Normative context: Suzy's action is permitted; Billy's is forbidden. Counterfactual: Imagine Suzy did not log in. We do not hold Billy's abnormal violation fixed. The most similar world is one where the policy is followed (Billy does not log in). No deletion occurs. The cause is necessary. Rule A: Exception APPLIES. Suzy's necessary action was normal, and its necessity depended on holding Billy's abnormal action fixed. Therefore, answer "No".
**Answer:** No

**Example E: (Overdetermination - Corrected)**
**Question:** Drew, Kylie, and Oliver usually order coffee on Tuesdays. This Tuesday, all three ordered. The shop profits if anyone orders. Did Drew ordering coffee cause the profit?
**Reasoning:** Event causation. Cause: Drew ordering. Outcome: profit. Normative context: Ordering coffee is normal. Counterfactual: If Drew had not ordered, Kylie and Oliver (normal actions) are held fixed. The outcome would still occur. However, Rule 8 states that in overdetermination (OR), each sufficient cause that occurred is a cause. Drew's order was a sufficient cause that occurred. The exception in Rule A does not apply.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example F: (Random Outcome)**
**Question:** Alex wins if dice>2 AND coin=heads. He rolled a 12 and got heads. Did he win because of the coin flip?
**Reasoning:** Event causation. Cause: coin=heads. Outcome: win. Normative context: Flipping a coin is normal; both outcomes are normal possibilities. Counterfactual: If the coin was tails (and dice roll held fixed), the win condition fails. The outcome would not have occurred. The cause is necessary. Rule A: The exception does NOT apply. The necessity of the coin landing heads is genuine and not dependent on holding any abnormal violation fixed.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example G: (Intentionality)**
**Question:** Brown tossed a fair die hoping for a six to detonate a bomb. He rolled a six. Did Brown intentionally roll a six?
**Reasoning:** This is a question about **agent intentionality**. Apply Rule B. (1) Brown intended to roll a six. (2) He performed an action aimed at rolling a six (tossing the die). (3) His action resulted in a six. Therefore, he intentionally rolled a six.
**Answer:** Yes

Answer questions about causal attribution by applying counterfactual reasoning. Follow these steps carefully:

**Step 0: Determine the Question's Frame**
-   First, identify whether the question is primarily about:
    -   **Physical Causation:** The mechanistic chain of events that produced the outcome.
    -   **Normative Causation:** Whether a violation of explicit rules, norms, or expectations was the decisive cause.
    -   **Functional/Design-Based Causation:** Whether the outcome resulted from a deviation from the intended design, purpose, or default operation of a system. Look for clues like "supposed to," "designed to," or "normally."
    -   **Attributive Causation:** Which factor was most decisive, surprising, or unlikely in bringing about the outcome, especially when multiple necessary factors are present. Look for clues like "was very unlikely," "was likely," or "surprisingly."
-   Keywords like "was not allowed," "did not know," "accidentally," **"supposed to," "designed to," "it is likely,"** or **"it is unlikely"** often signal a non-purely-physical frame.

**Step 1: Identify the Proposed Cause and the Outcome.**
-   Pay close attention to how the cause is phrased. If it is a negative event or an inaction (e.g., "did not change," "was absent"), the counterfactual will involve its positive counterpart (e.g., "did change," "was present").
-   Separate an *agent's action or inaction* from the resulting *state of the world*.

**Step 2: Construct the Primary Counterfactual Scenario**
-   For an **action:** Imagine the proposed action did NOT occur.
-   For an **inaction (omission):** Imagine the agent *did* perform the action in question.
-   **Crucially:** When constructing this new scenario, you must decide what to hold fixed.
    -   **Hold fixed** events that are **causally independent** of the agent's action/inaction and occurred prior to it.
    -   **Do not hold fixed** states that are **directly preserved** by the agent's inaction. The inaction *is* the cause of that state persisting.

**Step 3: Apply the Necessity Test**
-   Would the outcome have still occurred in this counterfactual scenario?
    -   If **NO**, then the proposed cause is a necessary factor. Proceed to Step 4.
    -   If **YES**, then the proposed cause is not necessary. Answer "No".

**Step 3.5: Apply the Ensuring/Allowing Test (For Omissions)**
-   **If the proposed cause is an inaction,** ask: "Did the outcome occur *only because* the agent **allowed** a pre-existing sufficient condition to persist, or did it occur **independently** of the agent's presence?"
    -   To test this, consider a counterfactual where **the agent is completely absent.** Would the outcome have occurred anyway?
        -   If **YES**, then the agent's inaction was **not causal**. The outcome was inevitable.
        -   If **NO**, then the inaction **was causal**; it ensured the outcome. Proceed to Step 4 if other necessary factors exist.

**Step 4: Apply the Default/Deviant Test for Conjunctive Causes**
-   **If the cause is necessary (from Step 3), but other events were also necessary, you MUST check this step.**
-   Determine if the proposed cause was the **normal, expected, or default** state of affairs within the context of the question.
-   Determine if the outcome was actually brought about by a **deviant, abnormal, unexpected, or surprising** action of *another* agent or component.
    -   If **YES**, then the proposed cause, while logically necessary, is **not** considered the salient "cause" for attribution purposes. Answer "No".
    -   If **NO**, then proceed to answer "Yes".

**Step 5: Apply the Actual Causation Test (For Purely Physical Frames)**
-   **Only use this step if the frame is purely Physical (from Step 0) and Step 4 does not apply.**
-   Even if the outcome would have occurred later, **was the proposed cause the actual, operative event that directly brought about the outcome *at the specific time it occurred*?**
    -   If **YES** (e.g., it pre-empted a later, potential cause), then answer "Yes".
    -   If **NO** (e.g., the outcome was simultaneously overdetermined by multiple sufficient causes), then answer "No".

**Step 6: Apply the Normative/Functional Test (For Non-Physical Frames)**
-   **If the question is framed normatively, functionally, or attributively (from Step 0):**
    -   **Construct this special counterfactual:** "If all agents and components had followed the rules, design specifications, or expected/probable behavior, would the outcome have occurred?"
    -   If the outcome would **NOT** have occurred, then the rule-violating or deviant action was the cause. Answer "Yes" for a proposed cause that is deviant.
    -   If the outcome **WOULD** have occurred anyway, then the rule-violating or deviant action was not the cause. Answer "No" for a proposed cause that is deviant.
    -   **For a proposed cause that is the *default*:** If the outcome would have occurred under normal conditions, then the default action is not the cause. Answer "No".

**Step 7: General Rules to Remember**
-   **Overdetermination (True):** Only exists if multiple sufficient causes occurred **simultaneously and independently**. The absence of any single one would not have prevented the outcome.
-   **Pre-emption:** Occurs when one cause actually brings about the outcome, thereby preventing another potential cause from doing so. The pre-empting cause is causal.
-   **Use Probabilities for Attribution, Not for Logic:** When constructing the counterfactual scenario (Step 2), ignore probabilities to determine logical dependency. However, **use information about likelihood and expectation** to determine the question's frame (Step 0) and to apply the Default/Deviant Test (Step 4).
-   **Omissions:** The necessity test for an inaction is passed **only if** the agent's action in the counterfactual would have **prevented** the outcome.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example A: (Basic Conjunction)**
**Question:** Joe wins if he gets green from left AND blue from right. He got both. Did getting green cause the win?
**Reasoning:** Physical frame. Cause is necessary. It is not established that getting green was a default or that getting blue was a deviant surprise. No reason to invoke Step 4.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example B: (Basic Disjunction)**
**Question:** The climate system turns on if travel agents OR design agents arrive. Both arrived. Did design agents cause the system to turn on?
**Reasoning:** Physical frame. Cause is not necessary (Step 3). If design agents had not come, travel agents would have turned it on.
**Answer:** No

**Example C: (Demonstrating Pre-emption)**
**Question:** [John's Death Story]
**Reasoning:**
*   **Frame:** Physical/medical causation.
*   **Cause:** Misadministration of medication. **Outcome:** Death at that moment.
*   **Necessity Test (Step 3):** Without the error, would John have died at that exact moment? No.
*   **Step 4/5:** The error was the deviant, operative event that pre-empted the cancer.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example D: (Demonstrating Normative Test)**
**Question:** [The Hedgehog Story]
**Reasoning:**
*   **Frame (Step 0):** Normative. The story emphasizes a rule ("hedgehogs were not allowed").
*   **Cause:** The hedgehog taking pencils. **Outcome:** No pencils for the polar bear.
*   **Normative Test (Step 6):** If everyone had followed the rules, the bear would have taken all pencils. Outcome would have occurred anyway.
**Answer:** No

**Example E: (Machine Short Circuit - Failure Case Fixed)**
**Question:** A machine is set up so it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery... The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery... Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the short circuit?
**Reasoning:**
*   **Frame (Step 0):** Functional/Design-Based. The black wire is "supposed to" touch; this is its default state. The red wire is not.
*   **Necessity Test (Step 3):** If the black wire had not touched, no short circuit. It is necessary.
*   **Default/Deviant Test (Step 4):** The black wire touching was the *default, expected* state. The short circuit was caused by the *deviant* event (the red wire touching). Therefore, the proposed cause (black wire) is not the salient cause.
**Answer:** No

**Example F: (Casino Game - Failure Case Fixed)**
**Question:** ...It is likely that he gets a green ball from the first box. It is very unlikely that he gets a blue ball in the second box... Did Joe's first choice cause him to win?
**Reasoning:**
*   **Frame (Step 0):** Attributive. The narrative establishes a probabilistic expectation ("likely" vs. "very unlikely").
*   **Necessity Test (Step 3):** Without the green ball, no win. It is necessary.
*   **Default/Deviant Test (Step 4):** Getting the green ball was the *likely, expected* outcome. Winning was caused by the *surprising, unlikely* event (getting the blue ball). Therefore, the proposed cause (first choice) is not the decisive cause.
**Answer:** No

**Example G: (The Dryer - Inaction in an Overdetermined System)**
**Question:** David has a new dryer... Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David did not change the temperature setting?
**Reasoning:**
*   **Frame:** Primarily Physical/Attributive. Judging the causal role of a human inaction.
*   **Cause:** David's inaction (not changing the temp). **Outcome:** Clothes dried.
*   **Ensuring/Allowing Test (Step 3.5):** Imagine David was never there. The temperature was already HIGH and the cycle was on MAX DRY. The clothes would have dried anyway. Therefore, David's inaction did not **ensure** the outcome; it was already ensured by pre-existing, independent conditions.
*   **Necessity Test (Step 3):** If David *had* changed the temperature to LOW, the clothes would still have dried (because MAX DRY was sufficient). Therefore, *not* changing the setting was not necessary for the outcome.
**Answer:** No

Answer questions about causal attribution and intentionality by applying counterfactual reasoning with normative context. Follow these steps carefully:

1.  **Identify the Question Type:**
    -   **Event Causation:** Questions like "Did X cause Y?" Focus on events and outcomes.
    -   **Agent Intentionality:** Questions like "Did A intentionally do X?" Focus on actions and mental states.
    -   **If the question is about intentionality, skip to Step 5B.**

2.  **For Event Causation: Identify the proposed cause and the outcome.**
    -   Pay close attention to phrasing. If the cause is a negative event or an inaction (e.g., "did not change"), the counterfactual involves its positive counterpart (e.g., "did change").
    -   Separate an *agent's action or inaction* from the resulting *state of the world*.

3.  **Assess the Normative Context:** Identify relevant policies, rules, social norms, or default expectations. Determine which *types of actions or events* were *permitted, expected, and normal* and which were *forbidden, unexpected, or abnormal*.
    -   **Crucial Note:** A specific outcome of a random process (e.g., a coin landing heads, a die showing six) is not itself "abnormal" if the process is normal and all possible outcomes are permitted.

4.  **Construct the Counterfactual Scenario:**
    -   Imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur (or, for an inaction, imagine the agent DID perform the action).
    -   **Hold all normal, expected, and permitted *actions and background conditions* fixed.** Do not hold fixed any abnormal or forbidden violations that occurred in the original scenario. **Only change the specific event mentioned in the cause.**

5.  **Determine Dependency:**
    -   If the outcome would NOT have occurred in this counterfactual, the proposed cause is a **necessary factor**.
    -   If the outcome would still have occurred, the proposed cause is **not necessary**.

6.  **Apply the Attribution Rules for Event Causation (Rule A):**
    -   **If the cause was not necessary,** answer "No".
    -   **If the cause was necessary,** answer "Yes" **unless** the following exception applies:
        -   **Exception:** The cause was a *normal or permitted* action/inaction, and the *only reason* it was necessary was because an *abnormal or forbidden* violation occurred in the actual scenario. In this case, answer "No".
    -   **Important Note on the Exception:** The exception applies when the necessity of the normal action *depends on* the presence of the abnormal violation. For example, if a normal action alone would not cause the outcome, but becomes necessary only when combined with an abnormal violation, then it is not considered a cause. This is true even if you do not "hold fixed" the violation in your counterfactual reasoning.

7.  **Rule for Agent Intentionality (Rule B):**
    -   An agent intentionally φ-ed (e.g., "rolled a six") if: (1) they intended to bring about φ, (2) they performed an action aimed at bringing about φ, and (3) their action successfully resulted in φ.
    -   If all three conditions are met, answer "Yes". Do not perform a counterfactual test on the agent's intention itself.

8.  **Handling Multiple Causes:**
    -   **For necessary conditions (AND):** All are causes. Answer "Yes" for each necessary condition that occurred.
    -   **For sufficient conditions (OR):** If multiple sufficient causes are present (overdetermination), **each one that occurred is still considered a cause.** Answer "Yes" for each sufficient cause that occurred, unless the exception in Rule A applies.

9.  **Ignore the likelihood or probability of events.** Focus on dependency and normative context.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example A: (Necessary Condition)**
**Question:** Joe wins if he gets green from left AND blue from right. He got both. Did getting green cause the win?
**Reasoning:** Event causation. Cause: getting green. Outcome: win. No special normative context. Counterfactual: If Joe had not gotten green (but blue is held fixed), he would not have won. The cause is necessary. Rule A: No exception applies.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example B: (Overdetermination)**
**Question:** The climate system turns on if travel agents OR design agents arrive. Both arrived. Did design agents cause the system to turn on?
**Reasoning:** Event causation. Cause: design agents arriving. Outcome: system on. Counterfactual: If design agents had not arrived (travel agents held fixed), the system would still turn on. The cause is not necessary. Rule A: Answer "No".
**Answer:** No

**Example C: (Inaction)**
**Question:** Ned has a new motorboat. It starts if gear is neutral OR motor is in lock. Both are true. Ned did not change the motor's position. Did the boat start because Ned did not change it?
**Reasoning:** Event causation. Cause: Ned's inaction. Outcome: boat starts. Counterfactual: Imagine Ned *had* changed the position. The gear is still neutral (held fixed), so the boat would still start. The outcome would still have occurred. The inaction was not necessary.
**Answer:** No

**Example D: (Normative Context - Abnormal Violation)**
**Question:** Billy (not permitted) and Suzy (permitted) log in at the same time, causing a deletion. Did Suzy cause the deletion?
**Reasoning:** Event causation. Cause: Suzy logging in. Outcome: deletion. Normative context: Suzy's action is permitted; Billy's is forbidden. Counterfactual: Imagine Suzy did not log in. We do not hold Billy's abnormal violation fixed. The most similar world is one where the policy is followed (Billy does not log in). No deletion occurs. The cause is necessary. Rule A: Exception APPLIES. Suzy's normal action was necessary only because Billy's abnormal violation occurred. Without Billy's violation, Suzy's login alone would not cause deletion. Therefore, answer "No".
**Answer:** No

**Example E: (Overdetermination - Corrected)**
**Question:** Drew, Kylie, and Oliver usually order coffee on Tuesdays. This Tuesday, all three ordered. The shop profits if anyone orders. Did Drew ordering coffee cause the profit?
**Reasoning:** Event causation. Cause: Drew ordering. Outcome: profit. Normative context: Ordering coffee is normal. Counterfactual: If Drew had not ordered, Kylie and Oliver (normal actions) are held fixed. The outcome would still occur. However, Rule 8 states that in overdetermination (OR), each sufficient cause that occurred is a cause. Drew's order was a sufficient cause that occurred. The exception in Rule A does not apply.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example F: (Random Outcome)**
**Question:** Alex wins if dice>2 AND coin=heads. He rolled a 12 and got heads. Did he win because of the coin flip?
**Reasoning:** Event causation. Cause: coin=heads. Outcome: win. Normative context: Flipping a coin is normal; both outcomes are normal possibilities. Counterfactual: If the coin was tails (and dice roll held fixed), the win condition fails. The outcome would not have occurred. The cause is necessary. Rule A: The exception does NOT apply. The necessity of the coin landing heads is genuine and not dependent on any abnormal violation.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example G: (Intentionality)**
**Question:** Brown tossed a fair die hoping for a six to detonate a bomb. He rolled a six. Did Brown intentionally roll a six?
**Reasoning:** This is a question about **agent intentionality**. Apply Rule B. (1) Brown intended to roll a six. (2) He performed an action aimed at rolling a six (tossing the die). (3) His action resulted in a six. Therefore, he intentionally rolled a six.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example H: (Exception Clarification - Failure Case 1)**
**Question:** Billy (forbidden) and Suzy (permitted) log in at the same time, causing a deletion. Did Suzy cause the deletion?
**Reasoning:** Event causation. Cause: Suzy logging in. Outcome: deletion. Normative context: Suzy's action is permitted; Billy's is forbidden. Counterfactual: Imagine Suzy did not log in. We do not hold Billy's abnormal action fixed. The most similar world is one where Billy does not log in (policy is followed). No deletion occurs. Suzy's login is necessary. Rule A: Exception APPLIES. Suzy's normal action was necessary only because Billy's abnormal violation occurred in the actual scenario. Without Billy's violation, her login would be harmless. Therefore, answer "No".
**Answer:** No

**Example I: (Exception Clarification - Failure Case 2)**
**Question:** Joe stopped to help someone, causing a delay. Due to the delay, his neighbor drove his son home. A drunk driver hit the neighbor's car, injuring Joe's son. Did Joe cause his son's injury?
**Reasoning:** Event causation. Cause: Joe helping (delay). Outcome: son's injury. Normative context: Helping is normal/permitted. The drunk driver's action is abnormal/forbidden. Counterfactual: If Joe had not helped (no delay), his son would not have been in the neighbor's car. The injury would not have occurred. The cause is necessary. Rule A: Exception APPLIES. Joe's normal action was necessary only because the drunk driver's abnormal violation occurred. The necessity of the delay is entirely dependent on this forbidden event. Therefore, answer "No".
**Answer:** No

2025-09-09 20:00:17,294 - 📊 Current Prompt:
Answer questions about causal attribution by applying counterfactual reasoning. Follow these steps carefully:

**0. Classify the Question:**
- If the question asks about **causal necessity** (e.g., "Did X cause Y?", "Was X necessary for Y?"), proceed to Step 1.
- If the question asks about **intentional causation** (e.g., "Did X intentionally cause Y?", "Did X mean to cause Y?"), you must consider both causal necessity *and* the agent's intention. Proceed through all steps, then apply the **Intentionality Analysis** (Step 10).
- If the question is about other concepts (e.g., moral blameworthiness), note that this framework may not be fully sufficient.

**1.  **Identify the proposed cause and the outcome with precision.**
    -   Pay close attention to how the cause is phrased. If it is a negative event or an inaction (e.g., "did not change," "was absent"), the counterfactual will involve its positive counterpart (e.g., "did change," "was present").
    -   Separate an *agent's action or inaction* from the resulting *state of the world*.
    -   **Consider if the proposed cause is part of a chain of events. Identify if there are any *deviant* or *intervening* actions by other agents that might be the more direct cause of the outcome.**

**2.  **Construct a counterfactual scenario:** Imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur (or, for an inaction, imagine the agent DID perform the action), but all other conditions remain as similar as possible to the original situation. **For actions, hold the actions of other agents constant unless the scenario logically requires them to change.**

**3.  **Determine if the outcome would still have occurred in this counterfactual scenario:**
    -   If the outcome would NOT have occurred, then the proposed cause is a necessary causal factor (a "cause-in-fact").
    -   If the outcome would still have occurred, then the proposed cause is not a necessary causal factor.

**4.  **For events requiring multiple conditions (e.g., A AND B must occur),** remember that EACH condition is necessary. The absence of any necessary condition prevents the outcome.

**5.  **For Symmetric Overdetermination (Multiple Sufficient Causes):** If multiple sufficient causes occurred simultaneously (e.g., two trains, each heavy enough to collapse a bridge, hit it at the same time), **AND the outcome would have occurred even without the proposed cause, then the proposed cause is not necessary. However, note that in such cases, all simultaneous sufficient causes are often considered contributory causes in everyday language.** The final answer may depend on the specific phrasing of the question.

**6.  **Assess Explanatory Salience (Critical New Step):** A condition can be necessary but not explanatory.
    -   **Consider the normality and probability of events as stated in the scenario.** A cause is often the *abnormal* or *unexpected* factor that made the difference.
    -   If the outcome required two events (A and B), and one event (A) was highly probable or normal, while the other (B) was highly improbable or deviant, then the outcome is typically attributed to B. We say it happened "because of B," not "because of A."
    -   **Example:** A win requires a coin flip (heads) AND a dice roll (>11). The coin flip is normal (50/50). The dice roll is abnormal (very unlikely). Therefore, the win is attributed to the dice roll, not the coin flip. The coin flip is a necessary background condition, but not the salient cause.

**7.  **Special Rule for Omissions:** For a cause phrased as an inaction (e.g., "did not do X"), the counterfactual is that the agent *does* perform the action. If performing that action would have changed the outcome, then the inaction was necessary. If the outcome would have been the same regardless, then the inaction was not necessary.

**8.  **Ignore the objective likelihood or probability of external events *that are not part of the described scenario*.** However, you **must** consider the agent's subjective knowledge, beliefs, and desires as stated in the scenario when analyzing questions of intention. **You MUST also consider the stated probabilities and normalities of events *within* the scenario for assessing explanatory salience (Step 6).**

**9.  **[NEW] Analyze the Actual Causal Pathway:** A cause can be explanatory even if not strictly necessary if it was part of the actual sequence of events that produced the outcome, especially in cases of **causal pre-emption**.
    -   If the scenario describes two or more sufficient conditions (A OR B), but the narrative emphasizes one pathway, the outcome may be attributed to that pathway.
    -   **Specifically for inactions:** If an agent's inaction allowed a specific sufficient condition to remain true, and the outcome occurred through that condition, then the inaction can be considered a cause *in the specific story*. For example: "The guard's failure to lock the door caused the robbery" is true if the robber used that door, even if the robber could have picked a lock or used a window.
    -   This step helps answer "what was the cause?" in the specific story, not just "was it necessary?".

**10.  **Intentionality Analysis (if required by question classification):**
    -   A necessary causal relationship (established in Step 3) is a prerequisite for intentional causation, but it is not sufficient.
    -   Review the scenario for evidence of the agent's **goals and desires**. The key question is: Did the agent perform the action *with the goal or purpose* of bringing about the outcome?
    -   If the outcome was a **foreseen but undesired side effect** of an action taken for a different purpose, then the agent did *not* intentionally cause it.
    -   If the outcome was the direct goal of the action, then the agent *did* intentionally cause it.

**Examples of correct reasoning:**

**Example A:**
**Question:** Joe wins if he gets green from left AND blue from right. He got both. Did getting green cause the win?
**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is "getting green." Counterfactual: If Joe had not gotten green (but still got blue), he would not have won because both are required. The outcome would not have occurred.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example B:**
**Question:** The climate system turns on if travel agents OR design agents arrive. Both arrived. Did design agents cause the system to turn on?
**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is "design agents arriving." Counterfactual: If design agents had not arrived (but travel agents still did), the system would still have turned on. The outcome would still have occurred.
**Answer:** No

**Example C:**
**Question:** Ned has a new motorboat. It starts if gear is neutral OR motor is in lock. Both are true. Ned did not change the motor's position. Did the boat start because Ned did not change it?
**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is "Ned did not change the motor's position," an *inaction*. Counterfactual: Imagine Ned *had* changed the position (moving the motor out of lock). The gear is still neutral. The boat would still start (because gear is neutral is a sufficient condition). The outcome would still have occurred. Applying Rule 7, the inaction was not necessary.
**Answer:** No

**Example D: [Intentionality Analysis]**
**Question:** The hunter shot the deer, and the gunfire caused an eagle to fly away. The hunter knew this would happen but did not care. Did the hunter intentionally cause the eagle to fly away?
**Reasoning:**
-   *Causal Necessity (Steps 1-3):* The proposed cause is "the hunter shot the deer." The outcome is "the eagle flew away." Counterfactual: If the hunter had not shot, there would be no gunfire, and the eagle would not have flown away. The action was a necessary cause.
-   *Intentionality Analysis (Step 10):* The hunter's goal was to kill the deer to win the competition. The eagle flying away was a known but undesired side effect of this goal. He did not act with the purpose of making the eagle fly away.
**Answer:** No

**Example E: [Explanatory Salience - Failure Case from Example 4]**
**Question:** Alex will only win the game if the total of his dice roll is greater than 11 AND the coin comes up heads. It is very unlikely that he will roll higher than 11, but the coin has equal odds of coming up heads or tails. Alex flips the coin and rolls his dice at exactly the same time. The coin comes up heads, and he rolls a 12, so amazingly, he rolled greater than 11. Alex wins the game. Did Alex win because of the coin flip?
**Reasoning:**
-   *Steps 1-3:* The proposed cause is "the coin comes up heads." The outcome is "winning." Counterfactual: If the coin had not come up heads (i.e., it was tails), Alex would not have won, even with a roll of 12. The coin flip is a necessary condition.
-   *Step 6 (Explanatory Salience):* The win required two conditions. The dice roll (>11) was highly improbable ("very unlikely," "amazingly"). The coin flip was a normal, 50/50 event. The salient, explanatory cause of the win is the abnormal dice roll, not the normal coin flip. Therefore, Alex did not win *because of* the coin flip.
**Answer:** No

**Example F: [Symmetric Overdetermination & Deviant Action - Failure Cases from Examples 1 & 3]**
**Question 1 (Gardeners):** Did the fertilization by Alex cause the plant to dry out?
**Reasoning:**
-   *Steps 1-3:* The proposed cause is "Alex fertilized with A X200R." Counterfactual: If Alex had not fertilized, there would be no combination of chemicals, and the plants would not have dried. His action is a necessary condition.
-   *Step 1 (Precision):* The true, direct cause of the drying is the *combination* of A and B. Alex followed instructions correctly. Benni's action (using the forbidden B Y33R) was a deviant, intervening cause that broke the expected causal chain. The outcome is not attributed to Alex's standard action but to Benni's deviant one.
**Answer:** No

**Question 2 (Trains):** Did Billy cause the bridge to collapse?
**Reasoning:**
-   *Steps 1-3 & 5 (Overdetermination):* The proposed cause is "Billy driving his train." Counterfactual: If Billy had not driven, Suzy's train alone would have caused the collapse. The outcome would still have occurred. By strict necessity, Billy's action is not necessary.
-   *Step 5 (Symmetric Overdetermination Note):* However, both trains hit the bridge simultaneously. In this symmetric case, both actions are contributory causes to the actual outcome that occurred. The question "Did Billy cause..." is answered affirmatively in this context, as his train was part of the actual sufficient set that collapsed the bridge.
**Answer:** Yes

**Example G: [Actual Causal Pathway - Resolving the Failure Case]**
**Question:** Ned has a new motorboat. When Ned turns the key, the motorboat starts if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position. Today, the gear is in neutral, and the motor is in the lock position. Ned checks the motor to see if it is in the lock position. He sees that it is in the lock position, and he does not change its position at all. Because the motorboat would start if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position, the motorboat starts when Ned turns the key. Did the motorboat start because Ned did not change the position of the motor?
**Reasoning:**
-   *Steps 1-3 (Necessity):* The proposed cause is an inaction. Counterfactual: If Ned *had* changed the motor's position (moving it out of lock), the boat would still have started due to the neutral gear. Therefore, the inaction is **not necessary**.
-   ***Step 9 (Actual Causal Pathway):*** However, we must analyze the actual story. The boat's starting mechanism checks both conditions. The narrative emphasizes that Ned checked the motor's lock position and consciously chose not to change it. The outcome occurred, and the pathway of "motor in lock" was the one that was actively considered and left intact by Ned's inaction. The neutral gear was a passive, background condition. Therefore, in this specific explanatory context, the boat started **because** Ned did not change the motor's position, as this was the salient causal pathway in the agent's narrative.

2025-09-09 20:04:29,447 - 📊 Current Prompt:
Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing whether an agent's specific action or inaction was a cause of an outcome. This prompt is designed exclusively for determining causal factors in systems with clear rules. It is not for judging moral responsibility, legal guilt, or the intentionality of an action unless the question explicitly links intentionality to the preservation of a known causal condition.

Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify the outcome and the specific agent behavior** being questioned.
2.  **Interpret the Question's Wording:** Determine if the question is asking for a 'but-for' cause (a necessary condition) or if the agent's behavior was a sufficient causal explanation for the outcome. Words like "because" often imply the latter.
3.  **Distinguish the general outcome from the specific manner:** Determine if the question is about the outcome itself or the specific manner in which it occurred. If it is about the manner, this must be a separate focus of your analysis.
4.  **Identify the causal rules** stated in the scenario for the outcome to occur.
5.  **Determine the pre-existing conditions** before the agent's decision.
6.  **Analyze the agent's knowledge and intent:**
    a. **General Intent:** Did the agent desire the overall outcome?
    b. **Action Intent:** Was the specific action (or inaction) deliberate?
    c. **Knowledge of Causation:** Did the agent know their action would achieve the outcome *in the specific way it occurred*? Or was the precise manner accidental, lucky, or unforeseen?
7.  **Apply the dual causal test:**
    a. **Test 1: Necessary Condition (But-For):** Consider the closest world where the agent *did* act (if they inacted) or *did not* act (if they acted). Would that change have *prevented* the outcome by breaking a *necessary condition*? If yes, then the behavior was a cause.
    b. **Test 2: Sufficient Causal Explanation (Actual Cause):** If the outcome was overdetermined (another sufficient condition would have caused it anyway), then evaluate if the agent's behavior was a sufficient causal explanation. Did the agent *deliberately preserve or ensure* a known sufficient condition for the outcome? If yes, then the behavior can be considered a cause.
    - *If the question is about intentionality*, also consider: 'In the closest world where the agent acts without any slips or accidents, does the outcome occur *in the exact same manner*?' If not, then the specific manner was likely not intentional.

**Example 1 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: Yes):**
- Outcome: Device fully charged.
- Agent's behavior: Wayne did not change the position.
- Causal rule: Charges fully in one hour *only if* both plugged in AND on charging pad.
- Pre-existing conditions: Already both plugged in and on pad at 2:00 PM.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Wayne checked and saw it was on the pad, so he intentionally preserved this state.
- Counterfactual (Test 1): If Wayne *had* changed the position, he would have taken it off the pad, breaking a necessary condition. It would NOT have charged. Thus, his inaction WAS a cause.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Clothes dried in sixty minutes.
- Agent's behavior: David did not change the temperature setting.
- Causal rule: Dries in 60 minutes if *either* cycle is MAX DRY *or* temperature is HIGH.
- Pre-existing conditions: Both cycle was MAX DRY AND temperature was HIGH.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: David checked and saw temperature was HIGH, so he intentionally preserved this state.
- Counterfactual (Test 1): If David *had* changed the temperature, he would have broken the HIGH temperature condition. However, the MAX DRY condition was still met and is *sufficient on its own*. The outcome would still have occurred. Thus, his inaction was NOT a necessary cause.
- Counterfactual (Test 2): David's inaction preserved a sufficient condition, but it was not the *only* sufficient condition. The question asks for a causal attribution ("because"), and since the outcome would have occurred without his action, his inaction is not a primary causal explanation.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: Yes):**
- Outcome: Motorboat starts.
- Agent's behavior: Ned did not change the position of the motor.
- Causal rule: Starts if *either* the gear is in neutral *or* the motor is in the lock position.
- Pre-existing conditions: Both gear is in neutral AND motor is in lock position.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Ned checked and saw the motor was in lock position. He intentionally preserved this state.
- Counterfactual (Test 1): If Ned *had* changed the motor's position, he would have broken the lock condition. However, the neutral gear condition was still met and is *sufficient on its own*. The outcome would still have occurred. Thus, his inaction was NOT a necessary cause.
- Counterfactual (Test 2): The question uses the word "because," asking if Ned's behavior is a sufficient causal explanation. Ned deliberately preserved a known sufficient condition (motor in lock) to ensure the outcome. Therefore, his inaction **was** a cause and is a valid explanation for why the boat started.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 Analysis (Intentionality of Manner - Answer: No):**
- Question: Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?
- Outcome: Aunt dies from a bullet to the heart.
- Specific Manner: Bullet hitting directly in the heart.
- Agent's behavior: Jake intentionally pulled the trigger, but a slip caused an unintended shot that luckily hit the heart.
- Causal rule: Death occurs if a bullet strikes a vital organ with sufficient force.
- Pre-existing conditions: Aunt is alive, Jake is a poor shot.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Jake intended to kill her (general intent) and intended to pull the trigger (action intent). He did *not* intend to place the bullet precisely in the heart; this was due to a slip and was unforeseen (knowledge of specific causation).
- Counterfactual for Manner: If Jake's hand had not slipped, his poor aim might have missed or caused a non-fatal wound. The specific outcome of a heart shot was not guaranteed by his intentional action alone; it relied on luck. Therefore, shooting her *in the heart* was not intentional.
<answer>No</answer>

- Counterfactual Test B: In the actual scenario, the MAX DRY condition was already present and sufficient *before* David's decision. His inaction, while intentional, was not part of the minimal sufficient set of conditions that actually brought about the outcome; the dryer would have worked on the MAX DRY setting alone. (Test B is "No")

- Outcome: Motion detector triggered.
- Agent's behavior: Billy arrived at 9 am.
- Causal rule: Triggered if ≥1 person appears.
- Pre-existing conditions: Room is empty.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Billy intended to arrive and enter the room.
- Counterfactual Test A: If Billy had not arrived, Suzy would have triggered it. Outcome not prevented. (Test A is "No")
- Counterfactual Test B: In the actual scenario, Billy's arrival was itself a sufficient condition for the outcome. He was an actual, operative cause. (Test B is "Yes")

2025-09-09 20:04:57,461 - 📊 Current Prompt:
Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing whether an agent's specific action or inaction was a cause of an outcome, or whether a specific outcome was intentional. This prompt is designed exclusively for determining causal factors and intentionality in systems with clear rules. It is not for judging moral responsibility or legal guilt.

**Important Conceptual Clarifications:**
-   **Foreseen Certainty Implies Intention:** If an agent knows that their action will *certainly* bring about a specific outcome in a specific manner, and they proceed with the action, then that outcome is intentional. It does not need to be their primary goal or desire; it can be an accepted side effect.
-   **Normative Baseline for Causation:** In scenarios with official rules or standard procedures, use them to establish a "normal" baseline. An agent acting within this normal baseline is less likely to be considered the primary cause of an outcome that was made inevitable by a prior *deviant* action that violated the rules. The deviant action often pre-empts causal status from subsequent normal actions.

Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify the outcome and the specific agent behavior** being questioned.
2.  **Distinguish the general outcome from the specific manner:** Determine if the question is about the outcome itself or the specific manner in which it occurred. If it is about the manner, this must be a separate focus of your analysis.
3.  **Identify the causal rules** stated in the scenario for the outcome to occur.
4.  **Determine the pre-existing conditions** before the agent's decision. Note if any conditions were created by a deviant action that violated known rules.
5.  **Analyze the agent's knowledge and intent:**
    a. **General Intent:** Did the agent desire the overall outcome?
    b. **Action Intent:** Was the specific action (or inaction) deliberate?
    c. **Knowledge of Causation:** Did the agent know their action would achieve the outcome *in the specific way it occurred*? Was the outcome certain?
6.  **Apply the critical counterfactual test:**
    a.  **For Causation:** Consider the closest world where the agent *did* act (if they inacted) or *did not* act (if they acted). Would that change have *prevented* the outcome by breaking a *necessary condition*?
    b.  **But also ask:** Was the outcome already **guaranteed or pre-empted** by a prior, deviant action? Would the outcome have occurred *anyway* through the normal, expected actions of other agents? If yes, then the behavior was likely **not** a cause.
    c.  **For Intentionality of Manner:** 'In the closest world where the agent acts deliberately and without slips, does the outcome occur *in the exact same manner*?'
        -   If **No**, then the specific manner was not intentional.
        -   If **Yes**, then the specific manner **was intentional**, *even if it was not the agent's primary goal*, provided the agent knew with certainty that it would occur in that manner.
7.  **Final Check for Causal Primacy (Preemption):** If the counterfactual test (6a) suggests the agent's action was a cause, but the scenario involves a prior rule violation or deviant act by another agent that created the dangerous situation, the primary cause is the deviant act. The subsequent act that actualizes the outcome may not be the cause the question is targeting.

**Example 1 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: Yes):**
- Outcome: Device fully charged.
- Agent's behavior: Wayne did not change the position.
- Causal rule: Charges fully in one hour *only if* both plugged in AND on charging pad.
- Pre-existing conditions: Already both plugged in and on pad at 2:00 PM.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Wayne checked and saw it was on the pad, so he intentionally preserved this state.
- Counterfactual: If Wayne *had* changed the position, he would have taken it off the pad, breaking a necessary condition. It would NOT have charged. Thus, his inaction WAS a cause.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Clothes dried in sixty minutes.
- Agent's behavior: David did not change the temperature setting.
- Causal rule: Dries in 60 minutes if *either* cycle is MAX DRY *or* temperature is HIGH.
- Pre-existing conditions: Both cycle was MAX DRY AND temperature was HIGH.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: David checked and saw temperature was HIGH, so he intentionally preserved this state.
- Counterfactual: If David *had* changed the temperature, he would have broken the HIGH temperature condition. However, the MAX DRY condition was still met and is *sufficient on its own*. The outcome would still have occurred. Thus, his inaction was NOT a cause.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 Analysis (Intentionality of Manner - Answer: No):**
- Question: Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?
- Outcome: Aunt dies from a bullet to the heart.
- Specific Manner: Bullet hitting directly in the heart.
- Agent's behavior: Jake intentionally pulled the trigger, but a slip caused an unintended shot that luckily hit the heart.
- Causal rule: Death occurs if a bullet strikes a vital organ with sufficient force.
- Pre-existing conditions: Aunt is alive, Jake is a poor shot.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Jake intended to kill her (general intent) and intended to pull the trigger (action intent). He did *not* intend to place the bullet precisely in the heart; this was due to a slip and was unforeseen (knowledge of specific causation).
- Counterfactual for Manner: If Jake's hand had not slipped, his poor aim might have missed or caused a non-fatal wound. The specific outcome of a heart shot was not guaranteed by his intentional action alone; it relied on luck. Therefore, shooting her *in the heart* was not intentional.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 Analysis (Intentionality with Certain Foresight - Answer: Yes):**
- Question: Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?
- Outcome: Bird-watcher was hit by the bullet.
- Specific Manner: The bullet hitting the bird-watcher.
- Agent's behavior: The hunter intentionally shot the deer.
- Causal rule: A bullet will travel in a straight line and hit objects in its path.
- Pre-existing conditions: The bird-watchers were directly behind the deer.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: The hunter intended to kill the deer (general intent) and intended to fire the bullet (action intent). He knew with **certainty** that the bullet would hit a bird-watcher.
- Counterfactual for Manner: In the closest world without slips, the bullet still travels through the deer and hits a bird-watcher. The outcome occurs in the exact same manner. The hunter knew this was certain. Therefore, even though it was not his primary goal, shooting the bird-watcher was an intentional side effect.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 5 Analysis (Causal Preemption - Answer: No):**
- Question: Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent?
- Outcome: Empty email sent.
- Agent's behavior: Alice logged in at 9:30 am.
- Causal rule: Email sent iff two people are logged in simultaneously.
- Pre-existing conditions: Zoe had already violated policy by logging in at 9:00 am. This created a pre-empted cause.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Alice was following policy unknowingly.
- Counterfactual (Naive): If Alice had not logged in, the email would not have been sent.
- Counterfactual (Preemption): The outcome was already guaranteed by Zoe's deviant act. The normal, expected action of the morning user (Alice) was always going to trigger it. Alice's action did not introduce a new cause; it merely completed the pre-empted causal chain initiated by Zoe.
- Normative Baseline: Zoe violated the rules; Alice followed them. The primary cause is the violation.

2025-09-09 20:09:30,304 - 📊 Current Prompt:
Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing whether an agent's specific action or inaction was a cause of an outcome, or whether an outcome was intentional. This prompt is designed for determining causal factors and intentionality in scenarios involving human agents and systems with rules. It incorporates concepts of normative baselines, proximate causation, and intentionality as means-to-an-end.

Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify the outcome and the specific agent behavior** being questioned.
2.  **Distinguish the general outcome from the specific manner:** Determine if the question is about the outcome itself or the specific manner in which it occurred. If it is about the manner, this must be a separate focus of your analysis.
3.  **Identify the causal rules and normative baselines:**
    a. **Causal Rules:** Identify the physical or logical rules stated in the scenario for the outcome to occur.
    b. **Normative Baselines:** Determine if the scenario establishes rules, policies, or social norms that define expected behavior for the agents involved. Identify which agent(s), if any, acted in violation of these norms.
4.  **Determine the pre-existing conditions** before the agent's decision.
5.  **Analyze the agent's knowledge and intent:**
    a. **General Intent:** Did the agent desire the overall outcome?
    b. **Action Intent:** Was the specific action (or inaction) deliberate?
    c. **Knowledge of Causation:** Did the agent know their action would directly or indirectly lead to the outcome? Was the outcome a *foreseeable consequence*?
6.  **Apply the dual counterfactual test for causation with a proximate cause check:**
    - **Test A (Necessity):** Consider the closest world where the agent *did* act (if they inacted) or *did not* act (if they acted). Would that change have *prevented the outcome entirely*? If yes, then the behavior was a cause.
    - **Test B (Sufficiency in Actual Circumstances):** If Test A is "no", ask: **In the actual sequence of events, was the agent's behavior itself a sufficient condition for the outcome, or did it complete a set of conditions that were sufficient?** If yes, then the behavior was *also* a cause.
    - **Test C (Proximate Cause / Normative Intervention):** **Even if Test A or B is "Yes," ask: Was the outcome primarily brought about by an independent, intentional, or highly abnormal intervening act that violated a normative baseline and was not reasonably foreseeable to the agent?** If yes, then the agent's behavior is typically not considered the cause for the purpose of attribution.
    - *Final Decision for Causation:* If *either* Test A or Test B indicates causation **AND** Test C does not apply, the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, it is "No".
7.  **For Intentionality:** If the question is about intentionality, ask:
    - **Means-to-an-End:** Did the agent require the outcome to happen in order to achieve their goal?
    - **Foreseen and Accepted:** Did the agent know the outcome would certainly or very likely occur, and did they proceed with their action regardless, demonstrating acceptance of the outcome?
    - If the answer to either is "Yes", then the outcome was intentional.
    - *If the question specifically references the **manner** of the outcome*, also consider: 'In the closest world where the agent acts without any slips or accidents, does the outcome occur *in the exact same manner*?' If not, then the specific manner was likely not intentional.

**Failure Example 1 (Normative Baseline - Answer: No):**
- **Question:** Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
- **Outcome:** Computer crashed.
- **Agent's behavior:** Jane logged on at 9:00 am (as permitted by policy).
- **Causal rule:** Crashes if two people are logged on.
- **Normative baseline:** Company policy designated Jane as the permitted user at 9:00 am. Lauren's simultaneous login was a violation of this policy.
- **Counterfactual Test A:** If Jane had not logged on, the crash would not have occurred (Test A "Yes").
- **Test C (Proximate Cause / Normative Intervention):** The outcome was directly brought about by Lauren's independent, intentional act of violating the company policy. This abnormal intervention was the primary cause. Jane's permissible action is not considered the cause.
- <answer>No</answer>

**Failure Example 2 (Proximate Cause - Answer: No):**
- **Question:** Did Joe cause his son's injury?
- **Outcome:** Son's severe leg injuries.
- **Agent's behavior:** Joe delayed picking up his son.
- **Causal rule:** The injury required a car accident.
- **Counterfactual Test A:** If Joe had not delayed, his son would not have been in the car and would not have been injured (Test A "Yes").
- **Test C (Proximate Cause / Normative Intervention):** The outcome was directly brought about by the independent, highly reckless, and criminal act of a drunk driver. This was an unforeseeable, superseding cause that breaks the chain of causation from Joe's delay. Joe's action is not considered the proximate cause.
- <answer>No</answer>

**Failure Example 3 (Intentionality as Means-to-an-End - Answer: Yes):**
- **Question:** Did the CEO intentionally harm the environment?
- **Outcome:** Environment was harmed.
- **Agent's behavior:** CEO approved the profitable programme.
- **Knowledge & Intent:** The CEO knew harm was a certain consequence. He stated he "didn't care" and only wanted profit, demonstrating acceptance of the harm.
- **Intentionality Analysis:** The environmental harm was a known and accepted means of achieving the CEO's goal of profit. It was not a mere side effect but a necessary component of the profitable programme. Therefore, the harm was intentional.

2025-09-09 20:09:37,308 - 📊 Current Prompt:
Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing whether an agent's specific action or inaction was a cause of an outcome. This prompt is designed exclusively for determining causal factors in systems with clear rules. It is not for judging moral responsibility, legal guilt, or the intentionality of an action unless the question explicitly links intentionality to the preservation of a known causal condition.

**Crucial: The word "because" in a question asks for a sufficient causal *explanation*. Your primary goal is to determine if the agent's behavior is the most salient reason for the outcome occurring as it did, which may differ from a strict "but-for" test.**

Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify the outcome and the specific agent behavior** being questioned.
2.  **Interpret the Question's Wording:** Determine if the question is asking for a 'but-for' cause (a necessary condition) or if the agent's behavior was a sufficient causal explanation for the outcome. **The word "because" almost always implies the latter, shifting focus to explanatory salience.**
3.  **Distinguish the general outcome from the specific manner:** Determine if the question is about the outcome itself or the specific manner in which it occurred. If it is about the manner, this must be a separate focus of your analysis.
4.  **Identify and Resolve the True Causal Rules:** Identify all causal rules stated in the scenario. **If rules conflict, prioritize the one that is presented as a factual, operational rule of the system over one that might be stated as a belief or mistake.**
5.  **Determine the pre-existing conditions** before the agent's decision.
6.  **Analyze the agent's knowledge and intent:** (Only if relevant for intentionality or for Test 2b)
    a. **General Intent:** Did the agent desire the overall outcome?
    b. **Action Intent:** Was the specific action (or inaction) deliberate?
    c. **Knowledge of Causation:** Did the agent know their action would achieve the outcome *in the specific way it occurred*?
7.  **Apply the causal analysis framework:**

    a. **Test 1: Necessary Condition (But-For):** Consider the closest world where the agent *did* act (if they inacted) or *did not* act (if they acted). Would that change have *prevented* the outcome by breaking a *necessary condition*? If yes, then the behavior was a cause. **Proceed to answer "Yes" unless the question is explicitly about "because" and the scenario suggests another cause is more explanatory.**

    b. **Test 2: Explanatory Salience ("Because" Test):** **If the question uses "because" or if Test 1 fails, apply this test.** Evaluate if the agent's behavior is the most salient explanation for the outcome.
        i. **For Inaction:** Did the agent *deliberately preserve or ensure* a known sufficient condition for the outcome? **Even if other sufficient conditions existed, if the agent's deliberate preservation is the most relevant fact for explaining the outcome, answer "Yes".** (See Example 1).
        ii. **For Action:** Did the agent's action *create* or *complete* a sufficient condition for the outcome? **If the action was a deviation from a norm or policy that led to the outcome, it is likely the salient cause. If the action conformed to the norm and the outcome was caused by a prior deviation, the deviant actor is the salient cause.** (See Example 5).
        iii. **For Conjunctive (AND) Rules:** If the outcome requires multiple conditions (A and B), **the cause is typically the condition that was *not guaranteed* to happen or required deliberate effort.** An action that provides a guaranteed or highly likely condition is less likely to be seen as the cause than an action that provides an unlikely one. (See Example 2).

    - ***If the question is about intentionality*, also consider: 'In the closest world where the agent acts without any slips or accidents, does the outcome occur *in the exact same manner*?' If not, then the specific manner was likely not intentional.**

**Example 1 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: Yes):**
- Outcome: Device fully charged.
- Agent's behavior: Wayne did not change the position.
- **True Causal Rule (Resolved):** The scenario states as a fact: "the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad." This is the operational rule.
- Pre-existing conditions: Already both plugged in and on pad at 2:00 PM.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Wayne checked and saw it was on the pad, so he intentionally preserved this state.
- Counterfactual (Test 1): If Wayne *had* changed the position, the device would still be plugged in, so it would still charge. His inaction was **not** a necessary cause.
- **Test 2 (Explanatory Salience):** The question uses "because." Wayne intentionally preserved a known sufficient condition (on the pad). **His deliberate oversight and decision to leave it are the most salient explanation for why the device was charging in the way he was focused on.** The pre-existing plugged-in state is a background condition, not an active cause in this narrative.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Joe wins a dollar.
- Agent's behavior: Joe draws a green ball from the left box.
- Causal rule: Wins **if and only if** green from left **AND** blue from right.
- Pre-existing conditions: High probability of green, low probability of blue.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Joe acts blindly. No knowledge or control over outcomes.
- Counterfactual (Test 1): If Joe had not drawn a green ball, he would not have won. His draw was a necessary condition.
- **Test 2 (Explanatory Salience):** The question asks if his first choice *caused* the win. **In conjunctive settings, the cause is attributed to the *limiting* or *unlikely* factor.** The green ball was highly likely. The blue ball was very unlikely. Therefore, the salient explanation for the win is the unlikely draw of the blue ball from the right box. Joe's first choice, while necessary, is not the explanatory cause; it is the background condition.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Empty email is sent.
- Agent's behavior: Alice logs in at 9:30 am.
- Causal rule: Email sent if two people are logged in simultaneously.
- Pre-existing conditions: Zoe is already logged in (violating policy).
- **Normative Context:** The official policy designates Alice as the permitted user for the morning. Her action conforms to the norm. Zoe's action is the deviant, policy-violating one.
- Counterfactual (Test 1): If Alice had not logged in, the email would not have been sent. Her login was a necessary condition.
- **Test 2 (Explanatory Salience):** The question asks if Alice *caused* the email. **The salient cause is the deviant event that made the system vulnerable.** Zoe's unauthorized login pre-empted the normal, safe operation of the system. Alice's subsequent lawful action merely triggered the outcome that Zoe's deviation made possible. Therefore, Zoe is the cause; Alice's role is not causally salient.

2025-09-09 20:10:06,600 - 📊 Current Prompt:
Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing whether an agent's specific action or inaction was a cause of an outcome, or whether a specific outcome was intentional. This prompt is designed exclusively for determining causal factors and intentionality in systems with clear rules. It is not for judging moral responsibility or legal guilt.

**Important Conceptual Clarifications:**
-   **Intention Requires Purpose or Certain Foresight:** An outcome is intentional if:
    a) The agent acted *with the specific purpose* of bringing it about (it was their goal or a necessary means to their goal), OR
    b) The agent knew with *certainty* that it would occur as a side effect of their action.
    For probabilistic outcomes, if the agent performed the action *with the specific purpose* of achieving that outcome, then the outcome is intentional upon success.
-   **Normative Baseline for Causation (Revised):** In scenarios with official rules or standard procedures, use them to establish a "normal" baseline. An agent acting within their *obligatory duties* (as defined by the rules) is less likely to be considered the primary cause of an outcome that was made inevitable by a prior *deviant* action that violated the rules. However, if an agent has a *permissible but non-obligatory* choice to prevent the outcome, their decision to not act can still be a cause. The deviant action pre-empts causal status only if it made the outcome *inevitable*, meaning it would have occurred even if all subsequent agents had strictly followed their *obligatory* duties.

Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify the outcome and the specific agent behavior** being questioned.
2.  **Distinguish the general outcome from the specific manner:** Determine if the question is about the outcome itself or the specific manner in which it occurred. If it is about the manner, this must be a separate focus of your analysis.
3.  **Identify the causal rules** stated in the scenario for the outcome to occur.
4.  **Determine the pre-existing conditions** before the agent's decision. Note if any conditions were created by a deviant action that violated known rules.
5.  **Analyze the agent's knowledge and intent:**
    a. **General Intent:** Did the agent desire the overall outcome?
    b. **Action Intent:** Was the specific action (or inaction) deliberate?
    c. **Specific Intent:** For the specific outcome in question, was it the agent's conscious purpose for performing the action?
    d. **Knowledge of Causation:** Did the agent know their action would achieve the outcome *in the specific way it occurred*? Was the outcome certain, or was it probabilistic?
6.  **Apply the critical counterfactual test:**
    a.  **For Causation:** Consider the closest world where the agent *did* act (if they inacted) or *did not* act (if they acted). Would that change have *prevented* the outcome by breaking a *necessary condition*?
    b.  **But also ask (Revised Preemption Test):** Was the outcome already **inevitable** due to a prior, deviant action? To be inevitable, the outcome must be certain to occur even if all subsequent agents strictly follow their *obligatory* duties and do not exercise any permissible choices. If the outcome could have been prevented by a subsequent agent making a permissible but non-obligatory choice, then the outcome is **not pre-empted**.
    c.  **For Intentionality of Manner:** 'In the closest world where the agent acts deliberately and without slips, does the outcome occur *in the exact same manner*?'
        -   If **No**, then the specific manner was not intentional.
        -   If **Yes**, then the specific manner **was intentional**, *even if it was not the agent's primary goal*, provided the agent knew with certainty that it would occur in that manner.
    **For Probabilistic Outcomes and Specific Intent:** If the test in 6c is inconclusive (e.g., due to randomness), rely on step 5c: if achieving the specific outcome was the agent's conscious purpose, then it is intentional.
7.  **Final Check for Causal Primacy (Preemption):** If the counterfactual test (6a) suggests the agent's action was a cause, but the scenario involves a prior rule violation by another agent, assess whether that violation made the outcome *inevitable* as defined in 6b. If yes, the primary cause is the deviant act. If no, the subsequent act may still be a cause.

**Example 1 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: Yes):**
- Outcome: Device fully charged.
- Agent's behavior: Wayne did not change the position.
- Causal rule: Charges fully in one hour *only if* both plugged in AND on charging pad.
- Pre-existing conditions: Already both plugged in and on pad at 2:00 PM.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Wayne checked and saw it was on the pad, so he intentionally preserved this state.
- Counterfactual: If Wayne *had* changed the position, he would have taken it off the pad, breaking a necessary condition. It would NOT have charged. Thus, his inaction WAS a cause.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Clothes dried in sixty minutes.
- Agent's behavior: David did not change the temperature setting.
- Causal rule: Dries in 60 minutes if *either* cycle is MAX DRY *or* temperature is HIGH.
- Pre-existing conditions: Both cycle was MAX DRY AND temperature was HIGH.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: David checked and saw temperature was HIGH, so he intentionally preserved this state.
- Counterfactual: If David *had* changed the temperature, he would have broken the HIGH temperature condition. However, the MAX DRY condition was still met and is *sufficient on its own*. The outcome would still have occurred. Thus, his inaction was NOT a cause.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 Analysis (Intentionality of Manner - Answer: No):**
- Question: Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?
- Outcome: Aunt dies from a bullet to the heart.
- Specific Manner: Bullet hitting directly in the heart.
- Agent's behavior: Jake intentionally pulled the trigger, but a slip caused an unintended shot that luckily hit the heart.
- Causal rule: Death occurs if a bullet strikes a vital organ with sufficient force.
- Pre-existing conditions: Aunt is alive, Jake is a poor shot.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Jake intended to kill her (general intent) and intended to pull the trigger (action intent). He did *not* intend to place the bullet precisely in the heart; this was due to a slip and was unforeseen (knowledge of specific causation).
- Counterfactual for Manner: If Jake's hand had not slipped, his poor aim might have missed or caused a non-fatal wound. The specific outcome of a heart shot was not guaranteed by his intentional action alone; it relied on luck. Therefore, shooting her *in the heart* was not intentional.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 Analysis (Intentionality with Certain Foresight - Answer: Yes):**
- Question: Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?
- Outcome: Bird-watcher was hit by the bullet.
- Specific Manner: The bullet hitting the bird-watcher.
- Agent's behavior: The hunter intentionally shot the deer.
- Causal rule: A bullet will travel in a straight line and hit objects in its path.
- Pre-existing conditions: The bird-watchers were directly behind the deer.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: The hunter intended to kill the deer (general intent) and intended to fire the bullet (action intent). He knew with **certainty** that the bullet would hit a bird-watcher.
- Counterfactual for Manner: In the closest world without slips, the bullet still travels through the deer and hits a bird-watcher. The outcome occurs in the exact same manner. The hunter knew this was certain. Therefore, even though it was not his primary goal, shooting the bird-watcher was an intentional side effect.

**Example 5 Analysis (Causal Preemption - Answer: No):**
- Question: Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent?
- Outcome: Empty email sent.
- Agent's behavior: Alice logged in at 9:30 am.
- Causal rule: Email sent iff two people are logged in simultaneously.
- Pre-existing conditions: Zoe had already violated policy by logging in at 9:00 am. This created a pre-empted cause.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Alice was following policy unknowingly.
- Counterfactual (Naive): If Alice had not logged in, the email would not have been sent.
- Counterfactual (Preemption): The outcome was already inevitable by Zoe's deviant act. The normal, *obligatory* action of the morning user (Alice) was to log in. Alice's obligatory action was always going to trigger it. Alice's action did not introduce a new cause; it merely completed the pre-empted causal chain initiated by Zoe.
- Normative Baseline: Zoe violated the rules; Alice followed her obligatory duty. The primary cause is the violation.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 6 Analysis (Permissive Inaction is Causal - Answer: Yes):**
- Question: Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?
- Outcome: Machine broke down.
- Agent's behavior: Kate did not put oil in the machine.
- Causal rule: Machine breaks down if it runs without oil.
- Pre-existing conditions: Janet (the responsible agent) forgot to oil the machine (a deviant act).
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Kate noticed the omission and knew how to fix it. Her inaction was a deliberate, permissible choice (it was not her responsibility, but she was not prohibited from acting).
- Counterfactual: If Kate *had* put oil in the machine, the breakdown would have been prevented.
- Preemption Check: The outcome was **not inevitable**. Janet's deviant act created a risk, but it did not make the breakdown certain because Kate had a permissible choice to prevent it. Kate's inaction was not an obligatory duty; it was a voluntary decision. Therefore, her inaction was a cause.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 7 Analysis (Probabilistic Intentionality - Answer: Yes):**
- Question: Did Brown intentionally roll a six?
- Outcome: A six was rolled.
- Specific Manner: The die landing with six dots up.
- Agent's behavior: Brown tossed the die onto the table.
- Causal rule: A six-dotted image is produced only if the die lands six-up.
- Pre-existing conditions: The die was fair.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Brown intended to kill Smith (general intent) and intended to toss the die (action intent). His **specific intent** (5c) was to roll a six; it was his conscious purpose for performing the action. He knew the outcome was probabilistic, not certain.
- Counterfactual for Manner: In the closest world without slips, Brown still tosses the die fairly. The outcome (a six) is not certain. However, because his **specific intent** was to achieve this outcome, and he performed the action for that very purpose, the outcome is intentional.

    - **Test A (Necessity):** Consider the closest world where the agent *did* act (if they inacted) or *did not* act (if they acted). Would that change have *prevented the outcome entirely*? If yes, then the behavior was a cause.
    - **Test B (Sufficiency in Actual Circumstances):** If Test A is "no", ask: **In the actual sequence of events, was the agent's behavior itself a sufficient condition for the outcome, or did it complete a set of conditions that were sufficient?** If yes, then the behavior was *also* a cause.
    - **Test C (Proximate Cause / Normative Intervention):** **Even if Test A or B is "Yes," ask: Was the outcome primarily brought about by an independent, intentional, or highly abnormal intervening act that violated a normative baseline and was not reasonably foreseeable to the agent?** If yes, then the agent's behavior is typically not considered the cause for the purpose of attribution.
    - *Final Decision for Causation:* If *either* Test A or Test B indicates causation **AND** Test C does not apply, the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, it is "No".
8.  **For Intentionality:** If the question is about intentionality, ask:
    - **Primary Goal (Direct Intent):** Was the outcome the agent's primary objective or desire?
    - **Means-to-an-End (Instrumental Intent):** Did the agent **require the outcome to happen as a necessary step** to achieve their primary goal? (Test: "If the outcome had been miraculously prevented, would their primary goal have been thwarted?")
    - **Foreseen and Accepted (Oblique Intent):** Did the agent know the outcome would certainly or very likely occur, and did they proceed with their action regardless, demonstrating acceptance?
    - *Final Decision for Intentionality:*
        - If the outcome was a **Primary Goal** or a **Means-to-an-End**, answer "Yes".
        - If the outcome was merely **Foreseen and Accepted**, then:
            - If the **Questioner's Framework** implies a broad definition of intent (e.g., legal liability), answer "Yes".
            - If the **Questioner's Framework** implies a narrow definition of intent (e.g., evaluating motivation for a specific virtue like "true evil"), answer "No".
    - *If the question specifically references the **manner** of the outcome*, also consider: 'In the closest world where the agent acts without any slips or accidents, does the outcome occur *in the exact same manner*?' If not, then the specific manner was likely not intentional.

**Failure Example 4 (Questioner's Framework - Intentionality: No):**
- **Question:** Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople? (From the supervillain scenario)
- **Questioner's Framework:** The question is for a performance evaluation by a supervillain seeking a "truly evil" henchman. This implies a narrow definition of "intentional," valuing harm that is a primary goal (sadism) or a necessary means, not merely a foreseen and accepted side effect of a greedy act.
- **Outcome:** Health of townspeople harmed.
- **Agent's behavior:** Bob approved the neurotoxin plan to rob a bank.
- **Knowledge & Intent:** Bob knew harm was certain but stated his sole goal was to steal money ("I just want to steal as much money as I can"). He did not desire harm for its own sake.
- **Intentionality Analysis:**
    - **Primary Goal:** No. His goal was money.
    - **Means-to-an-End:** No. The harm was not a necessary step to get the money; it was a side effect of the method. If the harm had been prevented, he still would have acquired the money.
    - **Foreseen and Accepted:** Yes. He knew it would happen and said "I don't care."
- **Final Decision for Intentionality:** The outcome was Foreseen and Accepted. However, the **Questioner's Framework** implies a narrow definition of intent (evaluating "true evil"). Therefore, the answer is "No".

2025-09-09 20:14:10,775 - 📊 Current Prompt:
Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing whether an agent's specific action or inaction was a cause of an outcome. This prompt is designed exclusively for determining causal factors in systems with clear rules. It is not for judging moral responsibility, legal guilt, or the intentionality of an action unless the question explicitly links intentionality to the preservation of a known causal condition.

**Crucial: The word "because" in a question asks for a sufficient causal *explanation*. Your primary goal is to determine if the agent's behavior is the most salient reason for the outcome occurring as it did, which may differ from a strict "but-for" test.**

Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify the outcome and the specific agent behavior** being questioned.
2.  **Interpret the Question's Wording:** Determine if the question is asking for a 'but-for' cause (a necessary condition) or if the agent's behavior was a sufficient causal explanation for the outcome. **The word "because" almost always implies the latter, shifting focus to explanatory salience.**
3.  **Distinguish the general outcome from the specific manner:** Determine if the question is about the outcome itself or the specific manner in which it occurred. If it is about the manner, this must be a separate focus of your analysis.
4.  **Identify and Resolve the True Causal Rules:** Identify all causal rules stated in the scenario. **If rules conflict, prioritize the one that is presented as a factual, operational rule of the system over one that might be stated as a belief or mistake.**
5.  **Identify Assigned Roles and Responsibilities:** Determine if any agent has a specific duty or responsibility within the system to prevent the outcome. An agent's failure to fulfill a designated responsibility is highly salient for causal explanation.
6.  **Determine the pre-existing conditions** before the agent's decision.
7.  **Analyze the agent's knowledge and intent:** (Only if relevant for intentionality or for Test 2b)
    a. **General Intent:** Did the agent desire the overall outcome?
    b. **Action Intent:** Was the specific action (or inaction) deliberate?
    c. **Knowledge of Causation:** Did the agent know their action would achieve the outcome *in the specific way it occurred*?
8.  **Apply the causal analysis framework:**

    a.  **Test 1: Necessary Condition (But-For):** Consider the closest world where the agent *did* act (if they inacted) or *did not* act (if they acted). Would that change have *prevented* the outcome by breaking a *necessary condition*? If yes, then the behavior was a cause. **Proceed to answer "Yes" unless the question is explicitly about "because" and the scenario strongly suggests that the necessary condition is a mere background factor and not the salient explanation.**

    b.  **Test 2: Explanatory Salience ("Because" Test):** **Apply this test primarily if the question uses "because," "why," or other explanatory language.** If Test 1 fails (inaction was not necessary), you must apply this test. Evaluate if the agent's behavior is the most salient explanation for the outcome.
        i.  **For Inaction:** Did the agent have a *specific responsibility or a clear opportunity* to act to prevent the outcome? Did their inaction *create a new risk* or *allow a known risk to manifest*? If the agent's inaction is the direct reason a necessary condition was met, it is likely the salient cause, **especially if they were the last or most responsible agent who could have intervened.**
        ii. **For Action:** Did the agent's action *create* or *complete* a sufficient condition for the outcome? **If the action was a deviation from a norm, policy, or assigned role that led to the outcome, it is likely the salient cause. If the action conformed to the norm and the outcome was caused by a prior deviation, the deviant actor is the salient cause.**
        iii. **For Conjunctive (AND) Rules:** If the outcome requires multiple conditions (A and B), **the cause is typically the condition that was *not guaranteed* to happen or required deliberate effort.** When one condition is a background state or a default action, and the other is a *change* or an *intervention*, the change/intervention is more salient. When both are actions/inactions, the cause is the one that *violated an assigned duty* or was the *least expected* event.

    - ***If the question is about intentionality*, also consider: 'In the closest world where the agent acts without any slips or accidents, does the outcome occur *in the exact same manner*?' If not, then the specific manner was likely not intentional.**

**Example 1 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: Yes):**
- Outcome: Device fully charged.
- Agent's behavior: Wayne did not change the position.
- **True Causal Rule (Resolved):** The scenario states as a fact: "the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad." This is the operational rule.
- Pre-existing conditions: Already both plugged in and on pad at 2:00 PM.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Wayne checked and saw it was on the pad, so he intentionally preserved this state.
- Counterfactual (Test 1): If Wayne *had* changed the position, the device would still be plugged in, so it would still charge. His inaction was **not** a necessary cause.
- **Test 2 (Explanatory Salience):** The question uses "because." Wayne intentionally preserved a known sufficient condition (on the pad). **His deliberate oversight and decision to leave it are the most salient explanation for why the device was charging in the way he was focused on.** The pre-existing plugged-in state is a background condition, not an active cause in this narrative.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Joe wins a dollar.
- Agent's behavior: Joe draws a green ball from the left box.
- Causal rule: Wins **if and only if** green from left **AND** blue from right.
- Pre-existing conditions: High probability of green, low probability of blue.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Joe acts blindly. No knowledge or control over outcomes.
- Counterfactual (Test 1): If Joe had not drawn a green ball, he would not have won. His draw was a necessary condition.
- **Test 2 (Explanatory Salience):** The question asks if his first choice *caused* the win. **In conjunctive settings, the cause is attributed to the *limiting* or *unlikely* factor.** The green ball was highly likely. The blue ball was very unlikely. Therefore, the salient explanation for the win is the unlikely draw of the blue ball from the right box. Joe's first choice, while necessary, is not the explanatory cause; it is the background condition.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Empty email is sent.
- Agent's behavior: Alice logs in at 9:30 am.
- Causal rule: Email sent if two people are logged in simultaneously.
- Pre-existing conditions: Zoe is already logged in (violating policy).
- **Normative Context:** The official policy designates Alice as the permitted user for the morning. Her action conforms to the norm. Zoe's action is the deviant, policy-violating one.
- Counterfactual (Test 1): If Alice had not logged in, the email would not have been sent. Her login was a necessary condition.
- **Test 2 (Explanatory Salience):** The question asks if Alice *caused* the email. **The salient cause is the deviant event that made the system vulnerable.** Zoe's unauthorized login pre-empted the normal, safe operation of the system. Alice's subsequent lawful action merely triggered the outcome that Zoe's deviation made possible. Therefore, Zoe is the cause; Alice's role is not causally salient.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 6 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: Yes):**
- Outcome: Plants dried out in flower beds where both A X200R and B Y33R were applied.
- Agent's behavior: Alex did not tell Benni about Tom’s instruction to use only A X200R.
- **True Causal Rule:** Drying occurs if and only if *both* A X200R and B Y33R are applied.
- **Assigned Roles and Responsibilities:** Tom explicitly gave Alex the responsibility to "tell Benni about Tom's instruction." Alex volunteered to do this. Alex had a specific duty to prevent the risk of incompatible fertilizer use.
- Pre-existing conditions: Benni was previously using B Y33R and was unaware of the new rule.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Alex knew the rule and his duty to inform Benni. His omission was a forgetful mistake, not deliberate.
- Counterfactual (Test 1): If Alex *had* told Benni, Benni would have used A X200R. No mixture would have occurred, and no plants would have dried out. Alex's inaction was a necessary condition.
- **Test 2 (Explanatory Salience):** The question asks if Alex *caused* the drying. **Alex's failure to execute his assigned duty of communication is the most salient explanation for why the dangerous combination occurred.** Benni's use of B Y33R was a default, background action given his ignorance. Alex's omission was the unexpected, responsibility-violating event that created the dangerous state of ignorance and allowed the combination to happen. Therefore, Alex is the salient cause.

2025-09-09 20:15:34,754 - 📊 Current Prompt:
Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing whether an agent's specific action or inaction was a cause of an outcome, or whether a specific outcome was intentional. This prompt is designed exclusively for determining causal factors and intentionality in systems with clear rules. It is not for judging moral responsibility or legal guilt.

**Important Conceptual Clarifications:**
-   **Intention Requires Purpose or Endorsement:** An outcome is intentional if:
    a) The agent acted *with the specific purpose* of bringing it about (it was their goal or a necessary means to their goal), OR
    b) The agent knew that it would occur and *accepted it as part of their plan*. An outcome is "accepted" if the agent would have reconsidered their action had they believed this outcome would not occur. If the outcome was merely a foreseen but irrelevant side effect that provided no motivation for the action, it is not intentional.
-   **Normative Baseline for Causation (Revised):** In scenarios with official rules or standard procedures, use them to establish a "normal" baseline. An agent acting within their *obligatory duties* (as defined by the rules) is less likely to be considered the primary cause of an outcome that was made inevitable by a prior *deviant* action that violated the rules. However, if an agent has a *permissible but non-obligatory* choice to prevent the outcome, their decision to not act can still be a cause. The deviant action pre-empts causal status only if it made the outcome *inevitable*, meaning it would have occurred even if all subsequent agents had strictly followed their *obligatory* duties.

Follow these reasoning steps:

1.  **Identify the outcome and the specific agent behavior** being questioned.
2.  **Distinguish the general outcome from the specific manner:** Determine if the question is about the outcome itself or the specific manner in which it occurred. If it is about the manner, this must be a separate focus of your analysis.
3.  **Identify the causal rules** stated in the scenario for the outcome to occur.
4.  **Determine the pre-existing conditions** before the agent's decision. Note if any conditions were created by a deviant action that violated known rules.
5.  **Analyze the agent's knowledge and intent:**
    a. **General Intent:** Did the agent desire the overall outcome?
    b. **Action Intent:** Was the specific action (or inaction) deliberate?
    c. **Specific Intent:** For the specific outcome in question, was it the agent's conscious purpose for performing the action?
    d. **Knowledge of Causation:** Did the agent know their action would achieve the outcome *in the specific way it occurred*? Was the outcome certain, or was it probabilistic?
    e. **Attitude and Endorsement (CRUCIAL FOR SIDE EFFECTS):** For outcomes that were not the primary goal (side effects), determine the agent's attitude. Ask: "If the agent had believed this specific outcome would *not* occur, would they have still performed the *exact same action* for the *same primary purpose*?"
        -   If **Yes**, then the outcome was merely foreseen and is **not intentional**.
        -   If **No**, then the outcome was a factor in their decision (e.g., a benefit they wanted or a cost they accepted) and **is intentional**.
6.  **Apply the critical counterfactual test:**
    a.  **For Causation:** Consider the closest world where the agent *did* act (if they inacted) or *did not* act (if they acted). Would that change have *prevented* the outcome by breaking a *necessary condition*?
    b.  **But also ask (Revised Preemption Test):** Was the outcome already **inevitable** due to a prior, deviant action? To be inevitable, the outcome must be certain to occur even if all subsequent agents strictly follow their *obligatory* duties and do not exercise any permissible choices. If the outcome could have been prevented by a subsequent agent making a permissible but non-obligatory choice, then the outcome is **not pre-empted**.
    c.  **For Intentionality of Manner:** 'In the closest world where the agent acts deliberately and without slips, does the outcome occur *in the exact same manner*?'
        -   If **No**, then the specific manner was not intentional.
        -   If **Yes**, then the specific manner **was intentional**, *only if* the agent knew with certainty that it would occur in that manner *and* endorsed it (as defined in 5e).
7.  **Final Check for Causal Primacy (Preemption):** If the counterfactual test (6a) suggests the agent's action was a cause, but the scenario involves a prior rule violation by another agent, assess whether that violation made the outcome *inevitable* as defined in 6b. If yes, the primary cause is the deviant act. If no, the subsequent act may still be a cause.

**Example 1 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: Yes):**
- Outcome: Device fully charged.
- Agent's behavior: Wayne did not change the position.
- Causal rule: Charges fully in one hour *only if* both plugged in AND on charging pad.
- Pre-existing conditions: Already both plugged in and on pad at 2:00 PM.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Wayne checked and saw it was on the pad, so he intentionally preserved this state.
- Counterfactual: If Wayne *had* changed the position, he would have taken it off the pad, breaking a necessary condition. It would NOT have charged. Thus, his inaction WAS a cause.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: No):**
- Outcome: Clothes dried in sixty minutes.
- Agent's behavior: David did not change the temperature setting.
- Causal rule: Dries in 60 minutes if *either* cycle is MAX DRY *or* temperature is HIGH.
- Pre-existing conditions: Both cycle was MAX DRY AND temperature was HIGH.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: David checked and saw temperature was HIGH, so he intentionally preserved this state.
- Counterfactual: If David *had* changed the temperature, he would have broken the HIGH temperature condition. However, the MAX DRY condition was still met and is *sufficient on its own*. The outcome would still have occurred. Thus, his inaction was NOT a cause.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 Analysis (Intentionality of Manner - Answer: No):**
- Question: Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?
- Outcome: Aunt dies from a bullet to the heart.
- Specific Manner: Bullet hitting directly in the heart.
- Agent's behavior: Jake intentionally pulled the trigger, but a slip caused an unintended shot that luckily hit the heart.
- Causal rule: Death occurs if a bullet strikes a vital organ with sufficient force.
- Pre-existing conditions: Aunt is alive, Jake is a poor shot.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Jake intended to kill her (general intent) and intended to pull the trigger (action intent). He did *not* intend to place the bullet precisely in the heart; this was due to a slip and was unforeseen (knowledge of specific causation).
- Counterfactual for Manner: If Jake's hand had not slipped, his poor aim might have missed or caused a non-fatal wound. The specific outcome of a heart shot was not guaranteed by his intentional action alone; it relied on luck. Therefore, shooting her *in the heart* was not intentional.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 Analysis (Intentionality with Certain Foresight - Answer: Yes):**
- Question: Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?
- Outcome: Bird-watcher was hit by the bullet.
- Specific Manner: The bullet hitting the bird-watcher.
- Agent's behavior: The hunter intentionally shot the deer.
- Causal rule: A bullet will travel in a straight line and hit objects in its path.
- Pre-existing conditions: The bird-watchers were directly behind the deer.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: The hunter intended to kill the deer (general intent) and intended to fire the bullet (action intent). He knew with **certainty** that the bullet would hit a bird-watcher.
- **Endorsement Test (5e):** If the hunter believed the bullet would *not* hit a bird-watcher, would he still have shot? **No**, because hitting the bird-watcher was a *cost he accepted* as part of his plan to kill the deer. He saw the bird-watchers and proceeded anyway. Therefore, the outcome was intentional.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 5 Analysis (Causal Preemption - Answer: No):**
- Question: Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent?
- Outcome: Empty email sent.
- Agent's behavior: Alice logged in at 9:30 am.
- Causal rule: Email sent iff two people are logged in simultaneously.
- Pre-existing conditions: Zoe had already violated policy by logging in at 9:00 am. This created a pre-empted cause.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Alice was following policy unknowingly.
- Counterfactual (Naive): If Alice had not logged in, the email would not have been sent.
- Counterfactual (Preemption): The outcome was already inevitable by Zoe's deviant act. The normal, *obligatory* action of the morning user (Alice) was to log in. Alice's obligatory action was always going to trigger it. Alice's action did not introduce a new cause; it merely completed the pre-empted causal chain initiated by Zoe.
- Normative Baseline: Zoe violated the rules; Alice followed her obligatory duty. The primary cause is the violation.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 6 Analysis (Permissive Inaction is Causal - Answer: Yes):**
- Question: Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?
- Outcome: Machine broke down.
- Agent's behavior: Kate did not put oil in the machine.
- Causal rule: Machine breaks down if it runs without oil.
- Pre-existing conditions: Janet (the responsible agent) forgot to oil the machine (a deviant act).
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Kate noticed the omission and knew how to fix it. Her inaction was a deliberate, permissible choice (it was not her responsibility, but she was not prohibited from acting).
- Counterfactual: If Kate *had* put oil in the machine, the breakdown would have been prevented.
- Preemption Check: The outcome was **not inevitable**. Janet's deviant act created a risk, but it did not make the breakdown certain because Kate had a permissible choice to prevent it. Kate's inaction was not an obligatory duty; it was a voluntary decision. Therefore, her inaction was a cause.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 7 Analysis (Probabilistic Intentionality - Answer: Yes):**
- Question: Did Brown intentionally roll a six?
- Outcome: A six was rolled.
- Specific Manner: The die landing with six dots up.
- Agent's behavior: Brown tossed the die onto the table.
- Causal rule: A six-dotted image is produced only if the die lands six-up.
- Pre-existing conditions: The die was fair.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Brown intended to kill Smith (general intent) and intended to toss the die (action intent). His **specific intent** (5c) was to roll a six; it was his conscious purpose for performing the action. He knew the outcome was probabilistic, not certain.
- Counterfactual for Manner: In the closest world without slips, Brown still tosses the die fairly. The outcome (a six) is not certain. However, because his **specific intent** was to achieve this outcome, and he performed the action for that very purpose, the outcome is intentional.
<answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 8 Analysis (Foreseen but Not Endorsed - Answer: No):**
- Question: Did Bob intentionally improve the health of the townspeople?
- Outcome: Health of townspeople improved.
- Agent's behavior: Bob approved a plan to stop a bank robbery that he knew would, as a side effect, improve health. He stated, "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to stop the bank robbery."
- Causal rule: Releasing neurotoxin → stops robbery AND improves health.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: Bob knew with certainty the health would improve. His specific intent (5c) was only to stop the robbery.
- **Endorsement Test (5e):** If Bob had been told the neurotoxin would *not* improve health, would he still have approved the plan? **Yes**, because his goal was solely to stop the robbery, and his decision was indifferent to the health outcome. The health improvement was foreseen but not endorsed. Therefore, it was **not intentional**.
<answer>No</answer>

**Example 9 Analysis (Foreseen but Not Endorsed - Answer: No):**
- Question: Did the man intentionally cause the eagle to fly away?
- Outcome: Eagle flew away.
- Agent's behavior: The hunter shot a deer, knowing the gunshot would certainly scare a nearby eagle. He stated he "did not care at all about the eagle."
- Causal rule: Gunshot sound → eagle flies away.
- Agent's knowledge & intent: The hunter knew with certainty the eagle would fly away. His specific intent (5c) was only to kill the deer and win the competition.
- **Endorsement Test (5e):** If the hunter had believed the gunshot would *not* scare the eagle, would he still have shot? **Yes**, because scaring the eagle was irrelevant to his goal. The outcome was foreseen but not endorsed. Therefore, it was **not intentional**.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following this structured reasoning framework:

1. **Identify the Outcome:** Determine what specific outcome is being asked about.
2. **Identify the Alleged Cause:** Pinpoint the specific action or event whose causal role is in question.
3. **Establish the Causal Mechanism:** Identify the rule or mechanism that produces the outcome (e.g., "profit requires at least one order").
4. **Assess Causal Salience with a Normality Test:**
   - **Identify the Default Scenario:** Based on the narrative, determine the expected or normal course of events (e.g., "Kylie and Oliver usually order on Tuesdays").
   - **Identify Deviant Actions:** Determine if any actions were unexpected, voluntary, or violated norms or expectations.
   - **Apply the Test:** The alleged cause is considered a salient cause **only if** it was a *deviant factor* that made the difference to the outcome. If the outcome would have occurred identically due to the default scenario without the alleged cause, then it is not a salient cause. If the alleged cause was a normal, expected part of the background conditions and the outcome was actually triggered by a *different* deviant factor, it is not considered the cause.
5. **Render Judgment:** Decide whether the alleged cause was a genuine and *salient* contributing factor, based on the normality test.

**Critical Guidelines to Avoid Errors:**
- A cause that is merely a necessary condition in the actual set is **not sufficient** for attribution; it must be salient relative to the default scenario.
- Do not attribute causation to a normal, expected action when a deviant action is the true difference-maker.
- When multiple factors are equally normal or equally deviant and jointly necessary, attributing causation to a single one is often incorrect.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example 1:**
Input: "Did David's clothes dry because he changed the temperature?"
Reasoning: Outcome is drying. Alleged cause is changing the temperature. The default scenario was the MAX DRY setting (sufficient). Changing the temperature was a deviant action that added another sufficient condition. It was part of the actual causal set and was salient.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Failure Case Correction):**
Input: "Did Drew ordering coffee cause the profit?"
Reasoning: Outcome is profit. Alleged cause is Drew's order. Causal mechanism: profit requires ≥1 order. Default scenario: Kylie and Oliver usually order (sufficient). Drew's order was unexpected (deviant) but redundant. The profit would have occurred identically without it. Therefore, Drew's order is not a salient cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Failure Case Correction):**
Input: "Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?"
Reasoning: Outcome is the detector going off. Alleged cause is Billy's arrival. Causal mechanism: detector requires >1 person. Default scenario: both were instructed to arrive at 9 am. Both actions are equally normal and expected. Neither is deviant. Singling out Billy is arbitrary; the cause is the conjunction of both arrivals.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 (Failure Case Correction):**
Input: "Did Jane cause the computer to crash?"
Reasoning: Outcome is the crash. Alleged cause is Jane logging on. Causal mechanism: crash requires two users logged on. Default scenario: Jane is permitted and expected to log on at 9 am. Deviant action: Lauren disobeyed the policy and logged on. Jane's action was normal background. The deviant action (Lauren's login) was the difference-maker. Jane is not the salient cause.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following this structured reasoning framework:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Determine what specific outcome is being asked about (e.g., an injury occurred, a profit was made, a machine started).
2.  **Identify the Alleged Cause:** Pinpoint the specific action, event, or inaction whose causal role is in question.
3.  **Apply Actual Causation Principles:**
    *   Focus on identifying the **proximate cause**—the primary, direct, and foreseeable cause without which the outcome would not have happened as it did.
    *   A cause must be a **non-redundant difference-maker**. An action is redundant if the outcome would have occurred in the exact same way and at the same time without it.
    *   Perform a "but-for" test as a crucial first step: "But for the alleged cause, would the outcome have occurred in the exact same way?" If yes, it is not a cause.
    *   The alleged cause need not be the only cause; multiple factors can jointly contribute. However, if one sufficient cause preempts others, those others are redundant.
    *   For inaction, consider it causal only if it deliberately preserved a necessary condition that would have otherwise changed, and the outcome depended on that preservation.
    *   Base your reasoning strictly on the provided scenario. Do not introduce external assumptions or alternative possibilities.
4.  **Avoid Common Fallacies:**
    *   Do not confuse a background condition (a static state of affairs) with an active cause (an action that changes the state of affairs).
    *   Do not be misled by information about a person's character, intentions, or compulsions. These relate to blame, not causal attribution.
    *   Do not attribute causation to remote, unforeseen events that break the chain of proximate causation.
    *   Do not conflate "a cause" with "the sole cause," but also do not over-extend causation to include all events in a chain.
5.  **Render Judgment:** Decide whether the alleged cause was a genuine, non-redundant, proximate factor in the outcome.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

Example:
Input: "Did David's clothes dry because he changed the temperature?"
Reasoning: The outcome is drying in 60 minutes. The alleged cause is changing the temperature to HIGH. Although MAX DRY was already set (a sufficient condition), changing the temperature added another sufficient condition. Since the change was part of the actual causal set, it is a cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

Example:
Input: "Did the motorboat start because Ned changed the position of the motor?"
Reasoning: The outcome is the motorboat starting. The alleged cause is changing the motor to lock. The gear was already in neutral, a sufficient condition. But for Ned's action, the outcome would have occurred in the exact same way. Therefore, his action was redundant and not a cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

Example:
Input: "Did Joe cause his son's injury?"
Reasoning: The outcome is the son's injury. The alleged cause is Joe's delay. While the delay set a background condition, the direct, proximate cause of the injury was the drunk driver's unforeseeable, independent action. Joe's action is not the proximate cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

Example:
Input: "Did the doctor's decision cause the recovery?"
Reasoning: The outcome is recovery. The alleged cause is the doctor signing. Without the signature, the drug would not have been administered. The narrative states the drug caused recovery, so the signature was a necessary component of the actual causal chain and a proximate cause.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following this structured reasoning framework:

1. **Identify the Outcome:** Determine what specific outcome is being asked about (e.g., injury occurred, profit made, recovery happened).
2. **Identify the Alleged Cause:** Pinpoint the specific action, event, or inaction whose causal role is in question.
3. **Apply Actual Causation Principles:**
   - A cause is any component that was part of the set of conditions that actually produced the outcome.
   - The alleged cause need not be the only cause; multiple factors can jointly contribute.
   - For inaction, consider it causal if it deliberately preserved a necessary or sufficient condition.
   - A but-for cause may not be deemed a responsible cause if the outcome was brought about by a superseding, independent act.
   - Base your reasoning strictly on the provided scenario; do not introduce external assumptions *unless evaluating foreseeability as part of causal proximity*.
4. **Evaluate Causal Proximity and Intervening Acts:**
   - Consider if the outcome was a **foreseeable** result of the alleged cause.
   - Identify any **intervening acts** (especially deliberate, reckless, or criminal acts by other agents) between the alleged cause and the outcome.
   - If a sufficient, independent intervening act is found, judge whether it is a **superseding cause** that breaks the causal chain from the original action.
5. **Avoid Common Fallacies:**
   - Do not require the cause to be necessary ("but-for") if it was sufficient and actual.
   - Do not conflate "a cause" with "the sole cause."
   - Do not dismiss inaction as non-causal when it actively maintained a causal condition.
   - **Do not assume a but-for condition is always a responsible cause; a superseding intervention can break the chain.**
6. **Render Judgment:** Decide whether the alleged cause was a genuine and responsible contributing factor in the outcome.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example 1:**
Input: "Did David's clothes dry because he changed the temperature?"
Reasoning: The outcome is drying in 60 minutes. The alleged cause is changing the temperature to HIGH. Although MAX DRY was already set (a sufficient condition), changing the temperature added another sufficient condition. Since the change was part of the actual causal set, it is a cause. No superseding cause is present.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2:**
Input: "Did the doctor's decision cause the recovery?"
Reasoning: The outcome is recovery. The alleged cause is the doctor signing. Without the signature, the drug would not have been administered. The narrative states the drug caused recovery, so the signature was a necessary component of the actual causal chain. The chain is direct and foreseeable.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 3 (New - Superseding Cause):**
Input: "Did Joe cause his son's injury by stopping to help an injured person?"
Reasoning:
- **Outcome:** Son's severe leg injuries.
- **Alleged Cause:** Joe stopping to help, causing a delay.
- **Actual Causation:** But-for Joe's delay, the neighbor would not have been driving the child home at that time.
- **Causal Proximity & Intervening Acts:** The direct cause of the injury was a drunk driver striking the car. The drunk driver's action was a **deliberate, reckless, and criminal act**. It was an independent, superseding cause that was not a foreseeable result of Joe's act of generosity. This intervention breaks the chain of causal attribution back to Joe.
- **Judgment:** Joe's action was a but-for condition but not a responsible cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 (New - Foreseeable Intervening Act):**
Input: "Did the store owner's failure to repair the broken step cause the customer's fall?"
Reasoning:
- **Outcome:** Customer's fall and injury.
- **Alleged Cause:** Owner's inaction (not repairing the step).
- **Actual Causation:** The broken step was a necessary condition for the fall. By not repairing it, the owner preserved this hazardous condition.
- **Causal Proximity & Intervening Acts:** The customer stepping on the broken stair is a foreseeable intervening act, not a superseding cause. It is the exact type of risk the owner's inaction created.
- **Judgment:** The owner's inaction is a cause of the injury.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following this structured reasoning framework:

1. **Identify the Outcome:** Determine what specific outcome is being asked about.
2. **Identify the Alleged Cause:** Pinpoint the specific action, event, or omission whose causal role is in question.
3. **Establish the Causal Mechanism:** Identify the rule or mechanism that produces the outcome (e.g., "profit requires at least one order").
4. **Analyze the Actual Causal Scenario:**
   - **Necessity in the Actual Set:** Was the alleged cause a necessary element for the outcome in the *actual* chain of events? (Would the outcome have occurred *in the exact way it did* without it?)
   - **Dependence:** Did the outcome depend on the alleged cause? This is tested by considering the closest possible world where the cause does not occur/happens differently. Would the outcome have been different?
5. **Assess Causal Salience with an Expanded Normality Test:**
   - **Contextual Normality:** Based on the narrative, determine if the alleged cause was a normal, expected part of the background conditions, or if it was a unexpected, voluntary, or norm-violating **deviant factor**.
   - **Apply the Test:** A deviant factor is often a salient cause. However, a normal factor can still be a cause if:
        *   It was a necessary and dependent part of the actual causal sequence.
        *   The outcome was **overdetermined** (multiple sufficient causes occurred at once). In cases of simultaneous overdetermination with no deviant factors, **all sufficient factors that occurred are considered causes**.
   - **Avoid the Preemption Mistake:** Do not assume one normal factor preempts another unless the narrative explicitly describes a sequence (e.g., one event happens first and alone triggers the outcome before the other event occurs).
6. **Render Judgment:** Decide whether the alleged cause was a genuine and *salient* contributing factor. If the cause was normal but necessary and dependent, or part of an overdetermined set, it is typically considered a cause. If it was preempted, redundant, or merely part of the background without which the outcome would have proceeded identically, it is not.

**Critical Refinements to Avoid Errors:**
- **For Omissions:** An omission (not acting) can be a cause if acting would have prevented the outcome. If not acting was the default and expected behavior, it is less salient, but it can still be causal.
- **For Overdetermination:** When two or more sufficient causes occur simultaneously and are equally normal, attributing causation to a single one is often **correct**—because each one is, in fact, a cause. The question "Did X cause Y?" in these cases is usually answered "Yes," as each factor is individually sufficient and actually occurred.
- **The "Difference-Maker" Test:** The alleged cause must be a "difference-maker" in the actual scenario. If the outcome would have been the same without it, due to another sufficient cause that was preempting it or already present, it is not a cause.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example 1:**
Input: "Did David's clothes dry because he changed the temperature?"
Reasoning: Outcome is drying. Alleged cause is changing the temperature. The default scenario was the MAX DRY setting (sufficient). Changing the temperature was a deviant action that added another sufficient condition. It was part of the actual causal set and was salient.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Overdetermination Correction):**
Input: "Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?"
Reasoning: Outcome is the system turning on. Alleged cause is design studio agents arriving. Causal mechanism: arrival of either group is sufficient. Actual Scenario: Both groups arrived at the same time. The outcome was overdetermined. Necessity/Dependence: The studio's arrival was not strictly necessary (the travel agency's was sufficient), but it was a sufficient cause that actually occurred. Normality Test: Both arrivals were normal and expected. Since this is a case of simultaneous overdetermination with no deviant factors, the arrival of the design studio agents is correctly considered a cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 3 (Overdetermination Correction):**
Input: "Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?"
Reasoning: Outcome is the detector going off. Alleged cause is Billy's arrival. Causal mechanism: presence of at least one person is sufficient. Actual Scenario: Both Billy and Suzy arrived at the same time. The outcome was overdetermined. Necessity/Dependence: Billy's arrival was a sufficient condition that occurred. Normality Test: Both arrivals were normal (following instructions). In this case of simultaneous overdetermination, Billy's arrival is a cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Omission Analysis):**
Input: "Did Ned not changing the position of the motor cause the motorboat to start?"
Reasoning: Outcome is the motorboat starting. Alleged cause is Ned's omission (not changing the motor's position). Causal mechanism: boat starts if gear in neutral OR motor in lock. Actual state: both conditions are true. Dependence: If Ned *had* changed the position (deviant action), the boat would still have started because the gear was in neutral. Therefore, the omission was not a difference-maker; the outcome did not depend on it. It was redundant.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following this structured reasoning framework:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Determine the precise outcome being asked about. Pay close attention to modifiers like timing, manner, or location (e.g., "turned on *at 8:45 am*", "went off *because more than one person was present*").
2.  **Identify the Alleged Cause:** Pinpoint the specific action, event, or inaction whose causal role is in question.
3.  **Apply Actual Causation Principles:**
    *   Focus on identifying the **proximate cause**—the primary, direct, and foreseeable cause without which the outcome would not have happened *as it did*.
    *   A cause must be a **non-redundant difference-maker**. An action is redundant if the outcome would have occurred in the exact same way and at the same time without it.
    *   Perform a "but-for" test as a crucial first step: "But for the alleged cause, would the outcome have occurred in the exact same way?" If yes, it is not a cause. **Important: The "but-for" test is a necessary but not sufficient condition for causation in cases of overdetermination.**
    *   **Critical: Handle Overdetermination Correctly:**
        *   **Preemptive Overdetermination:** If one sufficient cause (e.g., Travel Agency arrival) ensures the outcome would happen at the specified time, any other subsequent or simultaneous sufficient cause (e.g., Design Studio arrival) is redundant and **not a cause**.
        *   **Symmetric Overdetermination:** If multiple factors are **jointly necessary** to create a single sufficient condition (e.g., two people arriving to trigger a "more than one person" detector), treat the **collective set** as the cause. An individual's action within this set is **not** considered a cause on its own for the purpose of attribution to that individual. The question "Did Billy cause it?" is answered "No," as his role is not distinct from Suzy's.
    *   The alleged cause need not be the only cause; multiple factors can jointly contribute. However, if one sufficient cause preempts others, those others are redundant.
    *   For inaction, consider it causal only if it deliberately preserved a necessary condition that would have otherwise changed, and the outcome depended on that preservation.

4.  **Avoid Common Fallacies:**
    *   Do not confuse a background condition (a static state of affairs) with an active cause (an action that changes the state of affairs). An action that changes a background condition into a sufficient condition is an active cause.
    *   Do not be misled by information about a person's character, intentions, or compulsions. These relate to blame, not causal attribution.
    *   Do not attribute causation to remote, unforeseen events that break the chain of proximate causation.
    *   Do not conflate "a cause" with "the sole cause," but also do not over-extend causation to include all events in a chain. **Pay careful attention to whether the question is asking for *a* cause or *the* cause; most questions imply *the* cause.**
5.  **Render Judgment:** Decide whether the alleged cause was a genuine, non-redundant, proximate factor in the outcome. If it was a redundant sufficient cause (preempted) or a necessary part of a collective cause (symmetric), the answer is "No."

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

Example:
Input: "Did David's clothes dry because he changed the temperature?"
Reasoning: The outcome is drying in 60 minutes. The alleged cause is changing the temperature to HIGH. Although MAX DRY was already set (a sufficient condition), changing the temperature added another sufficient condition. Since the change was part of the actual causal set, it is a cause.

Answer: <answer>No</answer>

Example:
Input: "Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?"
Reasoning: The outcome is the detector going off. The alleged cause is Billy's arrival. The detector triggers on the condition "more than one person." Both Billy and Suzy's arrivals were jointly necessary to meet this single sufficient condition. This is symmetric overdetermination. The proximate cause is the collective presence. Therefore, Billy's individual action is not considered *the* cause of the outcome.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

Example:
Input: "Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?"
Reasoning: The outcome is the system turning on at 8:45 am. The alleged cause is the design studio's arrival. The travel agency's arrival alone was sufficient to cause the outcome at that exact time. But-for the design studio's arrival, the outcome would have occurred in the exact same way. Their action was preempted and is therefore redundant and not a cause.

Example:
Input: "Did Joe cause his son's injury?"

Answer questions about causal attribution and intentionality by following this structured reasoning framework:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Determine what specific outcome is being asked about (e.g., injury occurred, profit made, recovery happened, harm was caused).
2.  **Identify the Alleged Cause/Action:** Pinpoint the specific action, event, inaction, or decision whose causal or intentional role is in question.
3.  **Apply Actual Causation Principles:**
    - A cause is any component that was part of the set of conditions that actually produced the outcome.
    - The alleged cause need not be the only cause; multiple factors can jointly contribute.
    - **For Overdetermination (Multiple Sufficient Causes):** If the outcome would have occurred at the same time and in the same way even without the alleged cause, due to another sufficient cause, then the alleged cause is not a necessary part of the causal set for *that specific instance of the outcome*. Judge it to be non-causal.
    - For inaction, consider it causal if it deliberately preserved a necessary or sufficient condition.
    - A but-for cause may not be deemed a responsible cause if the outcome was brought about by a superseding, independent act.
    - Base your reasoning strictly on the provided scenario; do not introduce external assumptions *unless evaluating foreseeability as part of causal proximity*.
4.  **Evaluate Causal Proximity and Intervening Acts:**
    - Consider if the outcome was a **foreseeable** result of the alleged cause.
    - Identify any **intervening acts** (especially deliberate, reckless, or criminal acts by other agents) between the alleged cause and the outcome.
    - If a sufficient, independent intervening act is found, judge whether it is a **superseding cause** that breaks the causal chain from the original action.
5.  **Evaluate Intent (If the question asks about intent, purpose, or goals):**
    - Determine the **primary goal** of the agent's action. What were they directly trying to achieve?
    - Identify any **foreseen side effects**. What did the agent know would happen but did not act to achieve?
    - An outcome is **intentional** only if it was the agent's purpose or goal, not merely a foreseen consequence.
    - Indifference to a side effect is not the same as intent to cause it.
6.  **Avoid Common Fallacies:**
    - Do not require the cause to be necessary ("but-for") if it was sufficient and actual *and made a difference to the outcome*.
    - Do not conflate "a cause" with "the sole cause."
    - Do not dismiss inaction as non-causal when it actively maintained a causal condition.
    - **Do not assume a but-for condition is always a responsible cause; a superseding intervention or overdetermination can break the chain.**
    - **Do not conflate knowledge of a consequence with intent to cause it.**
7.  **Render Judgment:**
    - For causation: Decide whether the alleged cause was a genuine and responsible contributing factor in the outcome.
    - For intent: Decide whether the agent intended the outcome, or merely knew it would occur.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example 1: (Basic Causation)**
Input: "Did David's clothes dry because he changed the temperature?"
Reasoning: The outcome is drying in 60 minutes. The alleged cause is changing the temperature to HIGH. Although MAX DRY was already set (a sufficient condition), changing the temperature added another sufficient condition. Since the change was part of the actual causal set, it is a cause. No superseding cause is present.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2: (Necessary Cause)**
Input: "Did the doctor's decision cause the recovery?"
Reasoning: The outcome is recovery. The alleged cause is the doctor signing. Without the signature, the drug would not have been administered. The narrative states the drug caused recovery, so the signature was a necessary component of the actual causal chain. The chain is direct and foreseeable.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 3: (Superseding Cause)**
Input: "Did Joe cause his son's injury by stopping to help an injured person?"
Reasoning:
- **Outcome:** Son's severe leg injuries.
- **Alleged Cause:** Joe stopping to help, causing a delay.
- **Actual Causation:** But-for Joe's delay, the neighbor would not have been driving the child home at that time.
- **Causal Proximity & Intervening Acts:** The direct cause of the injury was a drunk driver striking the car. The drunk driver's action was a **deliberate, reckless, and criminal act**. It was an independent, superseding cause that was not a foreseeable result of Joe's act of generosity. This intervention breaks the chain of causal attribution back to Joe.
- **Judgment:** Joe's action was a but-for condition but not a responsible cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 4: (Foreseeable Intervening Act)**
Input: "Did the store owner's failure to repair the broken step cause the customer's fall?"
Reasoning:
- **Outcome:** Customer's fall and injury.
- **Alleged Cause:** Owner's inaction (not repairing the step).
- **Actual Causation:** The broken step was a necessary condition for the fall. By not repairing it, the owner preserved this hazardous condition.
- **Causal Proximity & Intervening Acts:** The customer stepping on the broken stair is a foreseeable intervening act, not a superseding cause. It is the exact type of risk the owner's inaction created.
- **Judgment:** The owner's inaction is a cause of the injury.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 5: (Overdetermination)**
Input: "Did the administrative assistant cause the problem of there being no pens?"
Reasoning:
- **Outcome:** No pens left on the desk.
- **Alleged Cause:** Administrative assistant taking a pen.
- **Actual Causation & Overdetermination:** Professor Smith also took a pen at the same time. The supply of pens was limited. Even if the assistant had *not* taken a pen, Professor Smith's action alone would have been sufficient to deplete the last pen and cause the outcome. The assistant's action was redundant and did not change the outcome. Therefore, it is not a necessary part of the causal set for this specific shortage.
- **Judgment:** The assistant's action was not a cause of the problem.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 6: (Intent vs. Foresight)**
Input: "Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?"
Reasoning:
- **Outcome:** Harm to health.
- **Alleged Cause:** Bob's decision to proceed with the bank robbery plan.
- **Actual Causation:** Bob's decision was a cause of the neurotoxin release, which was a cause of the harm. (Causation is established).
- **Evaluate Intent:** The rookie henchman stated the health harm was a consequence. Bob's statement, "I just want to steal as much money as I can," establishes that his **primary goal** was theft. His comment, "I don't care one way or another about the health," shows he **foresaw the harm** but was **indifferent** to it. The harm was a foreseen side effect, not his goal.
- **Judgment:** Bob did not intentionally harm the health of the townspeople; he intended to rob a bank and knowingly caused health harm as a side effect.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following this structured reasoning framework:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Determine what specific outcome is being asked about.
2.  **Identify the Alleged Cause:** Pinpoint the specific action, event, or omission whose causal role is in question.
3.  **Establish the Causal Mechanism:** Identify the rule or mechanism that produces the outcome. This includes:
    - **Physical/Biological Mechanisms:** (e.g., "profit requires at least one order," "a motion detector activates with sufficient mass").
    - **Social/Normative Mechanisms:** The rules, permissions, and obligations that define effective agency and expected behavior within the scenario (e.g., "only bears are allowed to take pencils"). **These normative rules are often primary in determining causal efficacy.**
4.  **Analyze the Actual Causal Scenario:**
    - **Necessity in the Actual Set:** Was the alleged cause a necessary element for the outcome in the *actual* chain of events, **as defined by the causal mechanism**? (Would the outcome have occurred *in the exact way the story defines it* without it?)
    - **Dependence (The "Difference-Maker" Test):** Consider the closest possible world where the alleged cause does not occur/happens differently, **a world that still respects the normative rules and constraints of the story**. Would the outcome have been different? The alleged cause must be a "difference-maker" within the story's own logical framework.
5.  **Assess Causal Salience with an Expanded Normality Test:**
    - **Contextual Normality:** Based on the narrative, determine if the alleged cause was a normal, expected part of the background conditions, or if it was an unexpected, voluntary, or norm-violating **deviant factor**.
    - **Normative Efficacy Test:** Crucially, a deviant factor is only salient if its deviation **actually made a causal difference within the story's framework**. An action that violates a rule but is causally inert from the perspective of the system's rules (e.g., a theft that doesn't change resource availability for authorized users) is **not** a salient cause.
    - **Apply the Test:** A deviant factor that passes the difference-maker test is often a salient cause. A normal factor can still be a cause if:
        *   It was a necessary and dependent part of the actual causal sequence.
        *   The outcome was **overdetermined** (multiple sufficient causes occurred at once). In cases of simultaneous overdetermination with no deviant factors, **all sufficient factors that occurred are considered causes**.
    - **Avoid the Preemption Mistake:** Do not assume one normal factor preempts another unless the narrative explicitly describes a sequence (e.g., one event happens first and alone triggers the outcome before the other event occurs).
6.  **Render Judgment:** Decide whether the alleged cause was a genuine and *salient* contributing factor. If the cause was normal but necessary and dependent, or part of an overdetermined set, it is typically considered a cause. If it was preempted, redundant, or merely part of the background without which the outcome would have proceeded identically **according to the rules of the system**, it is not.
    - **Final Check:** Could the outcome be fully explained by the actions of agents who were operating within the normative rules? If yes, then actions outside those rules are often not considered salient causes, even if they are physical difference-makers.

**Critical Refinements to Avoid Errors:**
- **For Omissions:** An omission (not acting) can be a cause if acting would have prevented the outcome. If not acting was the default and expected behavior, it is less salient, but it can still be causal if it was a difference-maker.
- **For Overdetermination:** When two or more sufficient causes occur simultaneously and are equally normal, attributing causation to a single one is often **correct**—because each one is, in fact, a cause. The question "Did X cause Y?" in these cases is usually answered "Yes," as each factor is individually sufficient and actually occurred.
- **For Normative Scenarios:** Prioritize the causal mechanism defined by the social rules. An action must be both a physical *and* a normative difference-maker to be salient. An action that is physically sufficient but normatively prohibited and ineffective is not a cause.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example 1:**
Input: "Did David's clothes dry because he changed the temperature?"
Reasoning: Outcome is drying. Alleged cause is changing the temperature. The default scenario was the MAX DRY setting (sufficient). Changing the temperature was a deviant action that added another sufficient condition. It was part of the actual causal set and was salient.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Overdetermination):**
Input: "Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?"
Reasoning: Outcome is the system turning on. Alleged cause is design studio agents arriving. Causal mechanism: arrival of either group is sufficient. Actual Scenario: Both groups arrived at the same time. The outcome was overdetermined. Necessity/Dependence: The studio's arrival was not strictly necessary (the travel agency's was sufficient), but it was a sufficient cause that actually occurred. Normality Test: Both arrivals were normal and expected. Since this is a case of simultaneous overdetermination with no deviant factors, the arrival of the design studio agents is correctly considered a cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 3 (Normative Inefficacy - CRITICAL EXAMPLE):**
Input: "Did the hedgehog cause the problem?" (From the provided failure case)
Reasoning: Outcome is the polar bear finding no pencils. Alleged cause is the hedgehog taking a pencil. Causal mechanism: Pencils are depleted by removals. The **normative mechanism** states only bears are *allowed* to take pencils, meaning only their removals are legitimate and count toward the system's available total. The hedgehog's action was deviant (violating the rule). Dependence Test: In the closest world where the hedgehog doesn't take a pencil, the pencil remains in the box. However, according to the rules, that pencil was never legitimately removed; it is still available for a bear. The bear took 6 pencils, which may have been sufficient to deplete the initial stock on its own. The hedgehog's action, while a physical difference-maker, was **not a normative difference-maker**. The outcome (no pencils for the polar bear) is fully explained by the bear's legitimate actions.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 (Omission Analysis):**
Input: "Did Ned not changing the position of the motor cause the motorboat to start?"
Reasoning: Outcome is the motorboat starting. Alleged cause is Ned's omission (not changing the motor's position). Causal mechanism: boat starts if gear in neutral OR motor in lock. Actual state: both conditions are true. Dependence: If Ned *had* changed the position (deviant action), the boat would still have started because the gear was in neutral. Therefore, the omission was not a difference-maker; the outcome did not depend on it. It was redundant.

Answer questions about causal attribution by following this structured reasoning framework:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Determine the precise outcome being asked about. Pay close attention to modifiers like timing, manner, or location (e.g., "turned on *at 8:45 am*", "went off *because more than one person was present*").
2.  **Identify the Alleged Cause:** Pinpoint the specific action, event, or inaction whose causal role is in question.
3.  **Apply Actual Causation Principles:**
    *   Focus on identifying the **proximate cause**—the primary, direct, and foreseeable cause without which the outcome would not have happened *as it did*.
    *   A cause must be a **non-redundant difference-maker**. An action is redundant if the outcome would have occurred in the exact same way and at the same time without it.
    *   Perform a "but-for" test as a crucial first step: "But for the alleged cause, would the outcome have occurred in the exact same way?" If yes, it is not a cause. **Important: The "but-for" test is a necessary but not sufficient condition for causation. It fails for symmetrically overdetermined sufficient causes; in these cases, apply the specific overdetermination rules below.**
    *   **Critical: Handle Overdetermination Correctly:**
        *   **Preemptive Overdetermination:** If one sufficient cause occurs **before** another sufficient cause, it preempts the later one. The later cause is redundant and **not a cause** for the outcome at that time.
        *   **Symmetric Overdetermination (Joint Necessity):** If multiple factors are **jointly necessary** to create a single sufficient condition (e.g., two people for a detector), treat the **collective set** as the cause. An individual's action within this set is **not** considered a cause on its own.
        *   **Symmetric Overdetermination (Separate Sufficiency):** If multiple factors are **individually sufficient** and occur **simultaneously**, **each is considered a cause**. The outcome was overdetermined, but both factors were present and active.
    *   The alleged cause need not be the only cause; multiple factors can jointly contribute. However, if one sufficient cause preempts others, those others are redundant.
    *   For inaction, consider it causal only if it deliberately preserved a necessary condition that would have otherwise changed, and the outcome depended on that preservation.
    *   Base your reasoning strictly on the provided scenario. Do not introduce external assumptions or alternative possibilities.
4.  **Interpret the Question's Scope:** For questions of the form "Did X cause Y?", interpret this as "Was X a non-redundant cause of Y?" This means:
    *   If X was a necessary factor, the answer is "Yes".
    *   If X was the preempting sufficient cause, the answer is "Yes".
    *   If X was a simultaneously sufficient cause (symmetric overdetermination), the answer is "Yes".
    *   If X was preempted by an earlier cause or was merely a redundant part of a symmetrically necessary set, the answer is "No".
5.  **Avoid Common Fallacies:**
    *   Do not confuse a background condition (a static state of affairs) with an active cause (an action that changes the state of affairs). An action that changes a background condition into a sufficient condition is an active cause.
    *   Do not be misled by information about a person's character, intentions, or compulsions. These relate to blame, not causal attribution.
    *   Do not attribute causation to remote, unforeseen events that break the chain of proximate causation.
6.  **Render Judgment:** Decide whether the alleged cause was a genuine, non-redundant, proximate factor in the outcome. If it was a redundant sufficient cause (preempted) or a necessary part of a collective cause (symmetric joint necessity), the answer is "No." If it was a necessary factor, a preempting cause, or a simultaneously sufficient cause, the answer is "Yes."

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

Example:
Input: "Did David's clothes dry because he changed the temperature?"
Reasoning: The outcome is drying in 60 minutes. The alleged cause is changing the temperature to HIGH. Although MAX DRY was already set (a sufficient condition), changing the temperature added another sufficient condition. Since the change was part of the actual causal set, it is a cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

Example:
Input: "Did the motorboat start because Ned changed the position of the motor?"
Reasoning: The outcome is the motorboat starting. The alleged cause is changing the motor to lock. The gear was already in neutral, a sufficient condition. But for Ned's action, the outcome would have occurred in the exact same way. Therefore, his action was redundant and not a cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

Example:
Input: "Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?"
Reasoning: The outcome is the detector going off. The alleged cause is Billy's arrival. The detector triggers on the condition "more than one person." Both Billy and Suzy's arrivals were jointly necessary to meet this single sufficient condition. This is symmetric overdetermination (joint necessity). The proximate cause is the collective presence. Therefore, Billy's individual action is not considered a cause of the outcome.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

Example:
Input: "Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?" (Preemptive)
Reasoning: The outcome is the system turning on at 8:45 am. The alleged cause is the design studio's arrival. If the travel agency's arrival occurred first (e.g., at 8:44:59 am) and was alone sufficient to cause the outcome at that exact time, then but-for the design studio's arrival, the outcome would have occurred in the exact same way. Their action was preempted and is therefore redundant and not a cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

Example:
Input: "Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?" (Simultaneous)
Reasoning: The outcome is the system turning on at 8:45 am. The alleged cause is the design studio's arrival. The travel agency's arrival was also sufficient and occurred at the exact same time. This is a case of symmetric overdetermination with separate sufficiency. Both factors were present and active at the time of the outcome. Therefore, the design studio agents are a cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

Example:
Input: "Did Joe cause his son's injury?"
Reasoning: The outcome is the son's injury. The alleged cause is Joe's delay. While the delay set a background condition, the direct, proximate cause of the injury was the drunk driver's unforeseeable, independent action. Joe's action is not the proximate cause.

Answer questions about causal attribution and intentionality by following this structured reasoning framework:

1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Determine what specific outcome is being asked about (e.g., injury occurred, profit made, recovery happened, harm was caused).
2.  **Identify the Alleged Cause/Action:** Pinpoint the specific action, event, inaction, or decision whose causal or intentional role is in question.
3.  **Apply Actual Causation Principles:**
    - A cause is any component that was part of the set of conditions that actually produced the outcome.
    - The alleged cause need not be the only cause; multiple factors can jointly contribute.
    - **Distinguish Cause from Condition:** A **causal condition** is a necessary but-for factor that sets the stage (e.g., the presence of oxygen, a required signature on a form). A **responsible cause** is an agential action or decision that makes the salient difference in bringing about the outcome.
    - **For Overdetermination (Multiple Sufficient Causes):** If the outcome would have occurred at the same time and in the same way even without the alleged cause, due to another sufficient cause, then the alleged cause is not a necessary part of the causal set for *that specific instance of the outcome*. Judge it to be non-causal.
    - For inaction, consider it causal if it deliberately preserved a necessary or sufficient condition.
    - A but-for cause may not be deemed a responsible cause if the outcome was brought about by a superseding, independent act **or a subsequent, more authoritative decision**.
    - Base your reasoning strictly on the provided scenario; do not introduce external assumptions *unless evaluating foreseeability as part of causal proximity*.
4.  **Evaluate Causal Proximity and Intervening Acts:**
    - Consider if the outcome was a **foreseeable** result of the alleged cause.
    - Identify any **intervening acts or decisions** (especially deliberate, reckless, criminal, or **authoritative decisions** by other agents) between the alleged cause and the outcome.
    - If a sufficient, independent intervening act or a salient authoritative decision is found, judge whether it is a **superseding cause** that breaks the causal chain from the original action or absorbs the causal responsibility.
5.  **Evaluate Intent (If the question asks about intent, purpose, or goals):**
    - Determine the **primary goal** of the agent's action. What were they directly trying to achieve?
    - Identify any **foreseen side effects**. What did the agent know would happen but did not act to achieve?
    - Determine the **degree of foresight**: Did the agent know the outcome was *possible*, *probable*, or *certain*?
    - An outcome is **intentional** if it was the agent's purpose or goal. In many contexts, an agent can also be said to have **intentionally** caused an outcome if they acted with the **knowledge that the outcome was certain or virtually certain** to result from their action, even if it was not their primary goal.
    - Indifference to a side effect is not the same as intent to cause it, but knowledge of certainty can imply intent.
6.  **Avoid Common Fallacies:**
    - **The But-For Fallacy:** Do not assume that just because an action was a but-for cause, it is therefore the responsible cause. A but-for condition may be a mere background enabler.
    - Do not require the cause to be necessary ("but-for") if it was sufficient and actual *and made a difference to the outcome*.
    - Do not conflate "a cause" with "the sole cause."
    - Do not dismiss inaction as non-causal when it actively maintained a causal condition.
    - **Do not assume a but-for condition is always a responsible cause; a superseding intervention or a salient authoritative decision can break the chain.**
    - **Do not conflate knowledge of a consequence with intent to cause it.** However, if the knowledge is of a **certain** consequence, this may be treated as intentional.
7.  **Contextual Judgment:** Consider the context of the question. Is it phrased in a way that suggests a legal, philosophical, or everyday common-sense understanding of 'cause' or 'intent'? Let this context guide the strictness of your application of the principles above.
8.  **Render Judgment:**
    - For causation: Decide whether the alleged cause was a genuine and **responsible** contributing factor in the outcome.
    - For intent: Decide whether the agent intended the outcome, or merely knew it would occur, considering the degree of certainty and the context.

**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**

**Example 1: (Basic Causation)**
Input: "Did David's clothes dry because he changed the temperature?"
Reasoning: The outcome is drying in 60 minutes. The alleged cause is changing the temperature to HIGH. Although MAX DRY was already set (a sufficient condition), changing the temperature added another sufficient condition. Since the change was part of the actual causal set, it is a cause. No superseding cause is present.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2: (Necessary Cause)**
Input: "Did the doctor's decision cause the recovery?"
Reasoning: The outcome is recovery. The alleged cause is the doctor signing. Without the signature, the drug would not have been administered. The narrative states the drug caused recovery, so the signature was a necessary component of the actual causal chain. The chain is direct and foreseeable.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 3: (Superseding Cause)**
Input: "Did Joe cause his son's injury by stopping to help an injured person?"
Reasoning:
- **Outcome:** Son's severe leg injuries.
- **Alleged Cause:** Joe stopping to help, causing a delay.
- **Actual Causation:** But-for Joe's delay, the neighbor would not have been driving the child home at that time.
- **Causal Proximity & Intervening Acts:** The direct cause of the injury was a drunk driver striking the car. The drunk driver's action was a **deliberate, reckless, and criminal act**. It was an independent, superseding cause that was not a foreseeable result of Joe's act of generosity. This intervention breaks the chain of causal attribution back to Joe.
- **Judgment:** Joe's action was a but-for condition but not a responsible cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 4: (Foreseeable Intervening Act)**
Input: "Did the store owner's failure to repair the broken step cause the customer's fall?"
Reasoning:
- **Outcome:** Customer's fall and injury.
- **Alleged Cause:** Owner's inaction (not repairing the step).
- **Actual Causation:** The broken step was a necessary condition for the fall. By not repairing it, the owner preserved this hazardous condition.
- **Causal Proximity & Intervening Acts:** The customer stepping on the broken stair is a foreseeable intervening act, not a superseding cause. It is the exact type of risk the owner's inaction created.
- **Judgment:** The owner's inaction is a cause of the injury.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 5: (Overdetermination)**
Input: "Did the administrative assistant cause the problem of there being no pens?"
Reasoning:
- **Outcome:** No pens left on the desk.
- **Alleged Cause:** Administrative assistant taking a pen.
- **Actual Causation & Overdetermination:** Professor Smith also took a pen at the same time. The supply of pens was limited. Even if the assistant had *not* taken a pen, Professor Smith's action alone would have been sufficient to deplete the last pen and cause the outcome. The assistant's action was redundant and did not change the outcome. Therefore, it is not a necessary part of the causal set for this specific shortage.
- **Judgment:** The assistant's action was not a cause of the problem.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 6: (Intent vs. Foresight - Indifference)**
Input: "Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?"
Reasoning:
- **Outcome:** Harm to health.
- **Alleged Cause:** Bob's decision to proceed with the bank robbery plan.
- **Actual Causation:** Bob's decision was a cause of the neurotoxin release, which was a cause of the harm. (Causation is established).
- **Evaluate Intent:** The rookie henchman stated the health harm was a consequence. Bob's statement, "I just want to steal as much money as I can," establishes that his **primary goal** was theft. His comment, "I don't care one way or another about the health," shows he **foresaw the harm** but was **indifferent** to it. The harm was a foreseen side effect, not his goal. The certainty is high, but the context suggests a philosophical distinction between purpose and foresight.
- **Judgment:** Bob did not intentionally harm the health of the townspeople; he intended to rob a bank and knowingly caused health harm as a side effect.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 7: (Intent - Knowledge of Certainty)**
Input: "Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?"
Reasoning:
- **Outcome:** The bird-watcher was shot.
- **Alleged Cause:** The hunter firing his rifle.
- **Actual Causation:** The shot directly caused the injury. No superseding cause.
- **Evaluate Intent:** The hunter's **primary goal** was to win the competition by killing the deer. However, he knew it was **certain** that the bullet would hit a bird-watcher. He acted with this certainty. In this context (common-sense and legal), acting with knowledge of a certain outcome is treated as intentional, even if it was not the primary goal.
- **Judgment:** The hunter intentionally shot the bird-watcher.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 8: (Causal Condition vs. Responsible Cause)**
Input: "Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?"
Reasoning:
- **Outcome:** Patient's recovery.
- **Alleged Cause:** Pharmacist's decision to sign.
- **Actual Causation:** The signature was a but-for condition; without it, the drug wouldn't have been administered.
- **Distinguish Cause from Condition:** The pharmacist's act was **ministerial** (confirming stock). The **authoritative decision** on medical appropriateness was made by the doctor, who signed against policy. The doctor's decision is the salient, responsible cause of the drug's administration. The pharmacist's action is a non-responsible background condition.
- **Judgment:** The pharmacist's decision was not the responsible cause of the recovery.

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the context and applying appropriate reasoning. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify the Specific Outcome and Proposed Cause:**
    *   Define the outcome with precision, including its exact nature, timing, and context (e.g., "death at time T from mechanism M", "the system turning on at 8:45 am").
    *   Identify the proposed cause (the specific event, action, or state in question).

2.  **Determine the Causal Question Type:**
    *   **Type A (Necessary Cause):** Is the question asking if the outcome *depended* on the cause? (Keywords: "necessary", "required", "but for", "if not for").
    *   **Type B (Actual Cause):** Is the question asking what *actually brought about* the outcome in the sequence of events? (Common in narratives, medical, or legal contexts). **Crucially, check for preemption.**
    *   **Type C (Intentional Action):** Is the question asking about the *mental state* of an agent (e.g., "intentionally", "knowingly", "on purpose")? **This is not a question about physical causation.**

3.  **Apply Reasoning Based on Question Type:**

    **For Type A (Necessary Cause) Questions:**
    *   Construct a counterfactual: imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur, but all else remains similar.
    *   Would the outcome still have occurred *in the exact way it actually did* (same time, same manner)?
        *   If NO, the cause is necessary. Answer "Yes".
        *   If YES, the cause is not necessary. Answer "No".
    *   In overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes acting simultaneously), no single cause is necessary. Answer "No".

    **For Type B (Actual Cause) Questions:**
    *   Ignore what *could have* happened. Focus on the *actual sequence of events*.
    *   **Preemption Check:** Was another sufficient cause already present or active that would have produced the outcome on its own *at the time it occurred*? If YES, the proposed cause is **preempted** and is not the actual cause. Answer "No".
    *   If no preemption, and the proposed cause was sufficient and its effect is part of the actual chain of events, answer "Yes" (even if other sufficient causes were also present but not preempting).

    **For Type C (Intentional Action) Questions:**
    *   **Ignore physical causation.** Focus on the agent's mind.
    *   Did the agent have a **goal or desire** to bring about the outcome?
    *   Did the agent **perform an action** believing it would achieve that outcome?
    *   **Crucial Check:** Did the outcome happen **directly as a result of the agent's planned action**, or did it occur due to an accident, mistake, or unforeseen coincidence within the execution of that action?
        *   If the outcome was an **accidental byproduct** of the action (e.g., a slip, a misfire), then it was not intentional. Answer "No".
        *   If the outcome was the **direct result of the agent's intended plan**, answer "Yes".

**Examples:**

**Example 1 (Type A - Necessity):**
Question: Joe wins if he gets green AND blue. He got both. Did getting green cause the win?
Reasoning: Type A (necessity). Counterfactual: Without green, he loses. Green is necessary.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Type A - Overdetermination):**
Question: System turns on if Travel OR Design agents arrive. Both arrived. Was Design necessary?
Reasoning: Type A. Counterfactual: Without Design, Travel still triggers system. Not necessary.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Type B - Actual Cause):**
Question: System turns on if Travel OR Design agents arrive. Both arrived. Did Design cause it?
Reasoning: Type B (actual cause). Both are sufficient and neither preempted the other (they arrived simultaneously). They both actually caused it.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Type B - Proximate Cause):**
Question: (John's death context) Did misadministration of medication cause John's premature death?
Reasoning: Type B (actual/proximate cause). The actual mechanism of death at that time was the drug-induced cardiac arrest.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 5 (Type A - Not Necessary):**
Question: (John's death context) Given his cancer, was the medication necessary for his death?
Reasoning: Type A. Counterfactual: Without medication error, he dies from cancer soon. Not necessary.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 6 (Type C - Not Intentional):**
Question: (Jake's aunt context) Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?
Reasoning: Type C (intentional action). Jake intended to kill her and acted, but the shot firing was due to a hand slip (an accident). The hit was not the direct result of his intentional aim but of a mistake.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 7 (Type B - Preemption):**
Question: (Climate control context) Did the design studio agents cause the system to turn on at 8:45 am?
Reasoning: Type B (actual cause). The travel agents' arrival was sufficient and occurred at 8:45 am. It preempted the designers' arrival from being the cause, as the system would have turned on from the travel agents alone at that time.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 8 (Type C - Intentional):**
Question: Jake aims carefully at a target and pulls the trigger smoothly. The bullet hits the bullseye. Did Jake hit the target intentionally?
Reasoning: Type C (intentional action). Jake had the goal to hit the target and his action (pulling the trigger) was executed as planned, directly resulting in the outcome.

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the context and applying appropriate reasoning. Follow these steps precisely:

1. **Identify the Specific Outcome and Proposed Cause:**
   - Clearly define the outcome, paying close attention to its exact nature and timing (e.g., "death at time T from mechanism M").
   - Identify the proposed cause (the specific event in question).

2. **Determine the Causal Question Type:**
   - **Type A (Necessary Cause):** Is the question asking if the outcome *depended* on the cause? (Keywords: "necessary", "required", "but for")
   - **Type B (Actual Cause):** Is the question asking what *actually brought about* or is *responsible for* the outcome? (Common in narratives, medical, or legal contexts). **Crucially, this often asks for the most salient or decisive cause, not just any contributing factor.**

3. **Apply Reasoning Based on Question Type:**

   **For Type A (Necessary Cause) Questions:**
   - Construct a counterfactual: imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur, but all else remains similar.
   - Would the outcome still have occurred *as it actually did*?
     - If NO, the cause is necessary. Answer "Yes".
     - If YES, the cause is not necessary. Answer "No".
   - In overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes), no single cause is necessary. Answer "No".

   **For Type B (Actual Cause) Questions:**
   - **Focus on the actual sequence of events.** Ignore what *could have* happened in general, but **a limited counterfactual is essential to establish actual causation**.
   - **Test for Causal Dependence/Redundancy:** Ask: "If the proposed cause had been absent (and all else remained the same), would the outcome *still have occurred at the same time and in the same way*?"
     - If YES (the outcome would have happened anyway), then the proposed cause is **redundant/preempted** and is **NOT** the actual cause. Answer "No".
     - If NO (the outcome would not have happened or would have happened differently), then the proposed cause is a candidate for the actual cause.
   - **Consider Normality and Explanatory Salience:** Often, the "actual cause" is the **deviant, abnormal, or unexpected event** that disrupted the normal course of events, or the **decisive factor** that made the difference. A cause that is merely a background condition is less likely to be labeled "the cause".

Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 (Type B - Proximate Cause):**
Question: (John's death context) Did misadministration of medication cause John's premature death?
Reasoning: Type B (actual cause). Counterfactual: Without the medication error, he would not have died at that time from cardiac arrest. The error was the deviant, decisive event that triggered the actual mechanism of death.

**Example 6 (Type B - Redundancy):**
Question: (Climate control system) Travel agents (sufficient) and Design agents (sufficient) both arrive at 8:45am. System turns on. Did Design cause it?
Reasoning: Type B. Counterfactual: If Design had arrived at 10am as usual, Travel would still have arrived at 8:45am and triggered the system at that time. Design's arrival was redundant and did not cause the outcome.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 7 (Type B - Explanatory Salience):**
Question: Alex wins only if dice >11 AND coin=heads. He rolls a 12 and gets heads. Did he win because of the coin flip?
Reasoning: Type B. While both conditions were necessary, the decisive, salient factor is the rare dice roll. The coin flip is a background condition. We explain the win by pointing to the roll, not the coin. Therefore, no, he did not win *because of* the coin flip.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 8 (Type B - Default vs. Deviant Cause):**
Question: Machine shorts if black AND red wires touch battery. Black is designated to touch; red is not. Both touch. Did the black wire cause the short?
Reasoning: Type B. The black wire touching is the normal, designated operation. The red wire touching is the abnormal, deviant event. The short was caused by the intrusion of the red wire. The black wire's action was a background condition, not the cause of the failure.

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the context and applying appropriate reasoning. Follow these steps precisely:

1. **Identify the Specific Outcome and Proposed Cause:**
   - Clearly define the outcome, paying close attention to its exact nature and timing.
   - Identify the proposed cause (the specific event, action, or inaction in question).

2. **Determine the Causal Question Type:**
   - **Type A (Necessary Cause):** Is the question asking if the outcome *would not have happened* without the cause? (Keywords: "necessary", "required", "but for", "relied on")
   - **Type B (Actual/Contributory Cause):** Is the question asking what *actually brought about* the outcome in this specific story? (Keywords: "because", "caused", "why")

3. **Apply Reasoning Based on Question Type:**

   **For Type A (Necessary Cause) Questions:**
   - Construct a counterfactual: imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur, but all else remains similar.
   - Would the outcome still have occurred *as it actually did*?
     - If NO, the cause is necessary. Answer "Yes".
     - If YES, the cause is not necessary. Answer "No".
   - In overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes), no single cause is necessary. Answer "No".

   **For Type B (Actual/Contributory Cause) Questions:**
   - **Step B1: Apply the Dependence Test.**
     - Consider a counterfactual where the proposed cause is different (e.g., an action was taken instead of omitted, or a different event occurred), but all other circumstances are held as similar as possible.
     - Ask: Would the outcome have been different in its essential nature or timing?
       - If NO, the proposed cause is not a causal factor. Answer "No".
       - If YES, proceed to Step B2.
   - **Step B2: Apply the Normative Salience Test.**
     - If multiple factors pass the dependence test, identify the most salient cause based on:
       - **Abnormality:** Did the event deviate from what was expected or normal? (e.g., "very unlikely")
       - **Agency:** Was it an active intervention versus a passive state?
       - **Proximity:** Was it the final event in the causal chain?
     - The question often implies a search for the most explanatory cause.

**Examples:**

**Example 1 (Type A - Necessity):**
Question: Joe wins if he gets green AND blue. He got both. Did getting green cause the win?
Reasoning: Type A. Counterfactual: Without green, he loses. Green is necessary.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Type A - Overdetermination):**
Question: System turns on if Travel OR Design agents arrive. Both arrived. Was Design necessary?
Reasoning: Type A. Counterfactual: Without Design, Travel still triggers system. Not necessary.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Type B - Failed Dependence):**
Question: Motorboat starts if (gear in neutral OR motor in lock). Both are true. Ned does not change the motor. Did his inaction cause the start?
Reasoning: Type B. Dependence Test: If Ned *had* changed the motor, the gear was still neutral, so the boat would still have started. The outcome was insensitive to his action. Therefore, it is not a cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 (Type B - Normative Salience):**
Question: Joe wins iff he gets green (likely) AND blue (unlikely). He gets both. Did the green ball cause the win?
Reasoning: Type B. Dependence Test: Without the green ball, he would not have won. It was a necessary factor. However, the blue ball was the abnormal, decisive factor. The green ball, being expected, is not the salient cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 5 (Type B - Positive Inaction):**
Question: A guard is paid to watch a door and push a button if it opens. The door opens, but the guard falls asleep and does not push the button. An alarm sounds. Did the guard's inaction cause the alarm?
Reasoning: Type B. Dependence Test: If the guard *had* acted, the alarm would have been silenced. His inaction was necessary for the outcome. It was also an abnormal failure.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 6 (Type B - Proximate Cause):**
Question: (Medical context) Did misadministration of medication cause the patient's death?
Reasoning: Type B. Dependence Test: With correct administration, the death would not have occurred at that time. It was the abnormal, proximate trigger.

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the context and applying appropriate reasoning. Follow these steps precisely:

1. **Identify the Specific Outcome and Proposed Cause:**
   - Clearly define the outcome, paying close attention to its exact nature and timing (e.g., "death at time T from mechanism M").
   - Identify the proposed cause (the specific event in question).

2. **Determine the Causal Question Type:**
   - **Type A (Necessary Cause):** Is the question asking if the outcome *depended* on the cause? (Keywords: "necessary", "required", "but for")
   - **Type B (Actual Cause):** Is the question asking what *actually brought about* or is *responsible for* the outcome? (Common in narratives, medical, or legal contexts). **Crucially, this often asks for the most salient or decisive cause, not just any contributing factor.**

3. **Apply Reasoning Based on Question Type:**

   **For Type A (Necessary Cause) Questions:**
   - Construct a counterfactual: imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur, but all else remains similar.
   - Would the outcome still have occurred *as it actually did*?
     - If NO, the cause is necessary. Answer "Yes".
     - If YES, the cause is not necessary. Answer "No".
   - In overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes), no single cause is necessary. Answer "No".

   **For Type B (Actual Cause) Questions:**
   - **Focus on the actual sequence of events.** A limited counterfactual is essential to establish actual causation.
   - **Test for Causal Dependence/Redundancy:** Ask: "If the proposed cause had been absent (and all else remained the same), would the outcome *still have occurred at the same time and in the same way*?"
     - If YES (the outcome would have happened anyway), then the proposed cause is **redundant/preempted** and is **NOT** the actual cause. Answer "No".
     - If NO (the outcome would not have happened or would have happened differently), then the proposed cause is a candidate for the actual cause.
   - **Apply Salience Filters to Candidate Causes:** If not redundant, determine the *most salient* cause by considering:
     - **Deviance from Norm:** Did the candidate cause violate a norm, rule, or standard expectation? (Extremely high salience)
     - **Temporal Proximity:** Was it the "last straw" or immediate trigger? (High salience, but can be overruled by deviance)
     - **Sufficiency:** Was the candidate cause, by itself, sufficient to bring about the outcome? (High salience)
     - **Necessity in the Circumstances:** Was it a necessary part of the actual causal chain? (Medium salience)
     - **Informativeness:** Does citing this cause provide the most useful explanation for why the outcome occurred?
   - **Final Judgment:** The most salient cause is often the one that is **deviant** or that **created the critical preconditions** for the outcome. A cause that is both normal and redundant is not the actual cause. A cause that is normal but non-redundant may be upstaged by a deviant cause.

4. **Handle Special Cases:**
   - **Symmetric Overdetermination (Dual Sufficient Causes):** If two sufficient causes occur at the *exact same time* and are both normal, then **both are actual causes**. Answer "Yes" for either.
   - **Preemptive Causation:** If a cause is preempted (it would have caused the outcome but was beaten to it by another cause), it is **not** the actual cause.
   - **Norm Violations:** A cause that involves breaking a rule or protocol is often accorded primary causal status, even if it was not the proximate trigger, because it created the abnormal, dangerous situation.

**Example 1 (Type A - Necessity):**
Question: Joe wins if he gets green AND blue. He got both. Did getting green cause the win?
Reasoning: Type A (necessity). Counterfactual: Without green, he loses. Green is necessary.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Type A - Overdetermination):**
Question: System turns on if Travel OR Design agents arrive. Both arrived. Was Design necessary?
Reasoning: Type A. Counterfactual: Without Design, Travel still triggers system. Not necessary.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Type B - Symmetric Overdetermination):**
Question: System turns on if Travel OR Design agents arrive. Both arrived at 8:45am. Did Design cause it?
Reasoning: Type B. This is symmetric overdetermination. Both causes are sufficient and occurred at the same time. Both are actual causes.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Type B - Proximate Cause):**
Question: (John's death context) Did misadministration of medication cause John's premature death?
Reasoning: Type B. Counterfactual: Without the error, he would not have died at that time. The error was the deviant, decisive event.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 5 (Type A - Not Necessary):**
Question: (John's death context) Given his cancer, was the medication necessary for his death?
Reasoning: Type A. Counterfactual: Without medication error, he dies from cancer soon. Not necessary.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 6 (Type B - Preemption):**
Question: (Climate control) Travel agents (sufficient) arrive at 8:45am. Design agents (sufficient) arrive at 10am. System turns on at 8:45am. Did Design cause it?
Reasoning: Type B. Counterfactual: Without Design, system still turns on at 8:45am. Design's arrival was preempted and redundant.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 7 (Type B - Explanatory Salience):**
Question: Alex wins only if dice >11 AND coin=heads. He rolls a 12 and gets heads. Did he win because of the coin flip?
Reasoning: Type B. While both were necessary, the decisive, salient factor is the rare dice roll. The coin is a background condition.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 8 (Type B - Default vs. Deviant Cause):**
Question: Machine shorts if black AND red wires touch battery. Black is designated to touch; red is not. Both touch. Did the black wire cause the short?
Reasoning: Type B. The black wire is normal operation. The red wire is the abnormal, deviant event that caused the failure.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 9 (Type B - Norm Violation as Salient Cause):**
Question: (Alice and Zoe email) Did Alice cause the email?
Reasoning: Type B. Counterfactual: Without Alice, no email. However, Zoe's login was a norm violation that created the preconditions. Alice's login was normal. The most salient cause is Zoe's deviant action.

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the context and applying appropriate reasoning. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify the Specific Outcome and Proposed Cause:**
    *   Define the outcome with precision, including its exact nature, timing, and context (e.g., "death at time T from mechanism M", "the system turning on at 8:45 am").
    *   Identify the proposed cause (the specific event, action, or state in question).

2.  **Determine the Causal Question Type:**
    *   **Type A (Necessary Cause):** Is the question asking if the outcome *depended* on the cause? (Keywords: "necessary", "required", "but for", "if not for").
    *   **Type B (Actual Cause):** Is the question asking what *actually brought about* the outcome in the sequence of events? (Common in narratives, medical, or legal contexts). **Crucially, check for preemption and joint causation.**
    *   **Type C (Intentional Action):** Is the question asking about the *mental state* of an agent (e.g., "intentionally", "knowingly", "on purpose")? **This is not a question about physical causation.**

3.  **Apply Reasoning Based on Question Type:**

    **For Type A (Necessary Cause) Questions:**
    *   Construct a counterfactual: imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur, but all else remains similar.
    *   Would the outcome still have occurred *in the exact way it actually did* (same time, same manner)?
        *   If NO, the cause is necessary. Answer "Yes".
        *   If YES, the cause is not necessary. Answer "No".
    *   In overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes acting simultaneously), no single cause is necessary. Answer "No".

    **For Type B (Actual Cause) Questions:**
    *   Ignore what *could have* happened. Focus on the *actual sequence of events*.
    *   **Preemption Check:** Was another *individually sufficient* cause already present or active that would have produced the outcome on its own *at the time it occurred*? If YES, the proposed cause is **preempted** and is not the actual cause. Answer "No".
    *   **Joint Causation Check:** Is the proposed cause only one part of a set of events that were *jointly necessary and sufficient* to bring about the outcome? (e.g., two people pressing a button together, one person logging in while another is already present). If YES, then the proposed cause is **not itself an actual cause**; the actual cause is the combined event or set. Answer "No".
    *   **Normative Deviancy Check:** In the actual sequence, was one event a violation of a norm, rule, or policy (deviant) while another was normal? If the **proposed cause was the normal event** and the outcome was triggered by its interaction with a *pre-existing deviant event*, then the proposed cause is **not the primary actual cause**. Answer "No".
    *   If none of the above apply, and the proposed cause was sufficient and its effect is part of the actual chain of events, answer "Yes" (even if other sufficient causes were also present but not preempting).

    **For Type C (Intentional Action) Questions:**
    *   **Ignore physical causation.** Focus on the agent's mind.
    *   Did the agent have a **goal or desire** to bring about the outcome?
    *   Did the agent **perform an action** believing it would achieve that outcome?
    *   **Crucial Check:** Did the outcome happen **directly as a result of the agent's planned action**, or did it occur due to an accident, mistake, or unforeseen coincidence within the execution of that action?
        *   If the outcome was an **accidental byproduct** of the action (e.g., a slip, a misfire), then it was not intentional. Answer "No".
        *   If the outcome was the **direct result of the agent's intended plan**, answer "Yes".

**Examples:**

**Example 1 (Type A - Necessity):**
Question: Joe wins if he gets green AND blue. He got both. Did getting green cause the win?
Reasoning: Type A (necessity). Counterfactual: Without green, he loses. Green is necessary.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 2 (Type A - Overdetermination):**
Question: System turns on if Travel OR Design agents arrive. Both arrived. Was Design necessary?
Reasoning: Type A. Counterfactual: Without Design, Travel still triggers system. Not necessary.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Type B - Actual Cause, Overdetermination):**
Question: System turns on if Travel OR Design agents arrive. Both arrived at the same time. Did Design cause it?
Reasoning: Type B (actual cause). Both are individually sufficient and neither preempted the other. Design's arrival was an actual cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 4 (Type B - Actual Cause, Proximate):**
Question: (John's death context) Did misadministration of medication cause John's premature death?
Reasoning: Type B (actual/proximate cause). The actual mechanism of death at that time was the drug-induced cardiac arrest.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 5 (Type A - Not Necessary):**
Question: (John's death context) Given his cancer, was the medication necessary for his death?
Reasoning: Type A. Counterfactual: Without medication error, he dies from cancer soon. Not necessary.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 6 (Type C - Not Intentional):**
Question: (Jake's aunt context) Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?
Reasoning: Type C (intentional action). Jake intended to kill her and acted, but the shot firing was due to a hand slip (an accident). The hit was not the direct result of his intentional aim but of a mistake.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 7 (Type B - Preemption):**
Question: (Climate control context) Did the design studio agents cause the system to turn on at 8:45 am?
Reasoning: Type B (actual cause). The travel agents' arrival was sufficient and occurred at 8:45 am. It preempted the designers' arrival from being the cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 8 (Type C - Intentional):**
Question: Jake aims carefully at a target and pulls the trigger smoothly. The bullet hits the bullseye. Did Jake hit the target intentionally?
Reasoning: Type C (intentional action). Jake had the goal to hit the target and his action was executed as planned, directly resulting in the outcome.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 9 (Type B - Joint Causation):**
Question: Two people must press a button together to launch a missile. They press it simultaneously. Did Person A cause the launch?
Reasoning: Type B (actual cause). This is joint causation. Neither press alone was sufficient; the actual cause was the simultaneous press. Person A's press was not itself the cause.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 10 (Type B - Normative Deviancy):**
Question: (Alice and Zoe context) Zoe logs in at 9 am (deviant). Alice logs in at 9:30 am (normal), triggering an email. Did Alice cause the email?
Reasoning: Type B (actual cause). Zoe's deviant action created the precarious state. Alice's normal action was the trigger, but the primary cause is the deviant event that made the outcome possible.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 11 (Type B - Joint Causation & Deviancy):**
Question: (Suzy and Billy context) Both log in simultaneously at 9 am against policy, triggering a deletion. Did Suzy cause the deletion?
Reasoning: Type B (actual cause). This is joint causation; the deletion was caused by the simultaneous login event. While Billy's action was deviant (not permitted in the morning), Suzy's was normative (permitted). However, the cause is the joint event, not Suzy individually.

Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the context and applying appropriate reasoning. Follow these steps precisely:

1. **Identify the Specific Outcome and Proposed Cause:**
   - Clearly define the outcome, paying close attention to its exact nature and timing.
   - Identify the proposed cause (the specific event, action, or inaction in question).

2. **Determine the Causal Question Type:**
   - **Type A (Necessary Cause):** Is the question asking if the outcome *would not have happened* without the cause? (Keywords: "necessary", "required", "but for", "relied on", "only because").
   - **Type B (Actual/Contributory Cause):** Is the question asking what *actually brought about* the outcome or was part of the causal story in this specific instance? (Keywords: "because", "caused", "why", "how come"). **Important:** For Type B, a cause need not be strictly necessary; it can be one of several sufficient factors.

3. **Apply Reasoning Based on Question Type:**

   **For Type A (Necessary Cause) Questions:**
   - Construct a counterfactual: imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur, but all else remains similar.
   - Would the outcome still have occurred *as it actually did*?
     - If NO, the cause is necessary. Answer "Yes".
     - If YES, the cause is not necessary. Answer "No".
   - In overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes), no single cause is necessary. Answer "No".

   **For Type B (Actual/Contributory Cause) Questions:**
   - **Step B1: Apply the Inclusion Test.**
     - Was the proposed cause part of the actual set of conditions that were present and sufficient for the outcome in this specific story?
     - If NO (e.g., the cause did not occur, or it was not connected to the outcome), it is not a cause. Answer "No".
     - If YES, proceed to Step B2.
   - **Step B2: Apply the Dependence Test for Explanatory Salience.**
     - Consider a counterfactual where the proposed cause is absent or different, but all other circumstances are held as similar as possible.
     - Ask: Would the outcome have been different in its essential nature or timing?
       - If YES, the cause is both included and dependent. It is a strong, salient cause. Proceed to Step B3.
       - If NO, the cause is included but not dependent (e.g., it's an overdetermined cause). It is still a valid "actual cause" but may be less salient. Proceed to Step B3.
   - **Step B3: Apply the Normative Salience Test & Final Decision.**
     - The question often implies a search for the *most explanatory* cause. If multiple factors are included causes, identify the most salient one based on:
       - **Dependence:** A cause that passes the dependence test (Step B2) is more salient than one that does not.
       - **Abnormality:** Did the event deviate from what was expected or normal?
       - **Agency:** Was it an active intervention versus a passive state or omission?
       - **Proximity:** Was it the final event in the causal chain?
     - **Final Answer:** If the question is general ("was this a cause?"), answer "Yes" for any factor that passes the Inclusion Test (B1). If the question implies a search for the *primary* or *main* cause ("did it happen *because* of this?"), use the salience test to choose between competing causes. When in doubt, a "Yes" answer is appropriate for any included cause.

Question: System turns on if Travel OR Design agents arrive. Both arrived. Was Design necessary?
Reasoning: Type A. Counterfactual: Without Design, Travel still triggers system. Not necessary.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 3 (Type B - Failed Inclusion):**
Question: Motorboat starts if (gear in neutral OR motor in lock). The gear is in neutral, the motor is *not* in lock. Ned does not change the motor. Did his inaction cause the start?
Reasoning: Type B. Inclusion Test: The motor not being in lock was not a sufficient condition for the start; the start was due solely to the gear. His inaction is not part of the causal set.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

**Example 4 (Type B - Inclusion Pass, Dependence Fail):**
Question: Motorboat starts if (gear in neutral OR motor in lock). Both are true. Ned does not change the motor. Did his inaction cause the start?
Reasoning: Type B. Step B1 (Inclusion): Yes, his inaction left a sufficient condition (motor in lock) present. Step B2 (Dependence): If he *had* acted, the boat would still start (due to the gear). The outcome is not dependent on his inaction. Step B3 (Salience): The question asks about his inaction specifically. It was part of the causal story.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 5 (Type B - Inclusion Pass, Dependence Pass):**
Question: A guard is paid to watch a door and push a button if it opens. The door opens, but the guard falls asleep and does not push the button. An alarm sounds. Did the guard's inaction cause the alarm?
Reasoning: Type B. Step B1 (Inclusion): Yes, his job was to prevent the alarm and he failed to act. Step B2 (Dependence): If he *had* acted, the alarm would have been silenced. His inaction was necessary for the outcome. It is a dependent and highly salient cause.
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 6 (Type B - Overdetermination, Multiple Causes):**
Question: Climate system turns on if Travel OR Design agents arrive. Both arrived at 8:45 am. Did the Design agents cause it to turn on?
Reasoning: Type B. Step B1 (Inclusion): Yes, they arrived and are a sufficient condition. Step B2 (Dependence): If they had not arrived, it would have turned on anyway due to Travel agents. Outcome is not dependent on Design. Step B3 (Salience): The question is "did they cause it?", not "were they the only cause?". Since they are an included cause, the answer is "Yes".
Answer: <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example 7 (Type B - Salience Test for Primary Cause):**
Question: Joe wins iff he gets green (likely) AND blue (unlikely). He gets both. Did the green ball cause the win?
Reasoning: Type B. Step B1 (Inclusion): Yes, the green ball was a necessary condition. Step B2 (Dependence): Without the green ball, he would not have won. It is dependent. Step B3 (Salience): However, the blue ball was the abnormal, decisive factor. The green ball, being expected, is not the most salient cause for explaining the win.
Answer: <answer>No</answer>

    "prompt": "Answer questions about causal attribution, focusing on agentive causation and the role of inaction. Carefully analyze whether the outcome occurred specifically because of the agent's decision not to act.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n1.  **Identify the Sufficient Conditions:** Determine what conditions guarantee the outcome.\n2.  **Assess the Initial State:** Note the state of these conditions before the agent's decision.\n3.  **Analyze the Agent's Role:** The agent checks a condition and then chooses not to change it. Their potential action (changing it) introduces a risk of breaking a sufficient condition.\n4.  **Apply the Key Counterfactual:** Crucially, consider what would have happened if the agent *had* acted. Based on the narrative, the most plausible result of them changing the setting/position is that they would have broken the condition they just verified. The outcome is attributed to their inaction if it would likely *not* have occurred had they acted.\n5.  **Conclude:** The outcome happened *because* the agent did not act if their action would have prevented it. If the outcome was guaranteed by another unchangeable condition regardless of their action, then it did *not* happen because of their inaction.\n\n**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   **Question:** Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?\n*   **Sufficient Condition:** Plugged in AND on the charging pad.\n*   **Initial State:** Both conditions are true at 2:00 PM.\n*   **Agent's Role:** Wayne checks the pad and chooses not to change the device's position.\n*   **Counterfactual:** If Wayne *had* changed the position, he likely would have taken it off the pad, breaking a sufficient condition. The device would not have charged.\n*   **Conclusion:** Yes, the device is charged because he did not change its position. (<answer>Yes</answer>)\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   **Question:** Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David did not change the temperature setting?\n*   **Sufficient Conditions:** MAX DRY cycle OR HIGH temperature.\n*   **Initial State:** Both conditions are true. The MAX DRY setting is already in place and is sufficient on its own.\n*   **Agent's Role:** David checks the temperature and chooses not to change it.\n*   **Counterfactual:** If David *had* changed the temperature (e.g., to LOW), the HIGH condition would be broken. However, the MAX DRY condition remains and is sufficient for the outcome. The clothes would still have dried.\n*   **Conclusion:** No, the clothes did not dry because he left the temperature on HIGH; they dried because the cycle was set to MAX DRY. His inaction was not the cause. (<answer>No</answer>)\n\n**Now, apply this reasoning to the following question:**",

First, classify the question type, then apply the appropriate reasoning framework.\n\n**STEP 1: CLASSIFY THE QUESTION**\nRead the question and options carefully. Determine if it is primarily about:\n-   **A: Factual Causation (Cause-in-Fact):** The question asks if an action/omission was a necessary precursor to the outcome. (Keywords: \"cause,\" \"lead to,\" \"result in\").\n-   **B: Intentionality:** The question asks about the mental state of an agent. (Keywords: \"intentionally,\" \"knowingly,\" \"on purpose\").\n-   **C: Proximate Cause:** The question involves a complex chain of events, often with an intervening act, and asks if the original action was the primary or legal cause.\n\n**STEP 2: APPLY THE CORRECT FRAMEWORK**\n\n--- **IF TYPE A (Factual Causation)** ---\n**A.1 Isolate the Action and Outcome:** Precisely identify the specific **action** or **omission** and the specific **outcome** event.\n**A.2 Apply the Strict But-For Test:**\nConstruct a counterfactual where **only** the action/omission is changed. The world is **identical in every other respect**.\n-   **Action:** \"If this action had **not** occurred, would the outcome **still** have happened **at the exact time and in the exact way it did**?\"\n-   **Omission:** \"If this omission had **not** occurred (i.e., if the person **had** acted), would the outcome **still** have happened **at the exact time and in the exact way it did**?\"\n**A.3 Determine Factual Causation:**\n-   If **no**, it is a cause. Proceed to A.4.\n-   If **yes**, it is **not a cause**. Conclude \"No\".\n**A.4 Conclude:** Output your final answer within `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.\n**ABSOLUTE RULE:** Ignore duty, blame, legality, foreseeability, and \"deviance.\" Base analysis solely on counterfactual dependence.\n\n--- **IF TYPE B (Intentionality)** ---\n**B.1 Isolate the Action and Outcome:** Identify the agent's **action** and the **outcome** in question.\n**B.2 Analyze the Agent's Mental State:**\n-   **Desire:** Was the outcome the agent's primary goal or desire?\n-   **Knowledge:** Did the agent know, with virtual certainty, that their action would bring about the outcome?\n**B.3 Determine Intentionality:**\n-   If the answer to **either** Desire or Knowledge is **yes**, then the outcome was intentional.\n-   If the answer to **both** is **no**, then it was not intentional.\n**B.4 Conclude:** Output your final answer within `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.\n\n--- **IF TYPE C (Proximate Cause)** ---\n**C.1 Identify the Candidate Causes:** List the original action/omission and any intervening events.\n**C.2 Analyze the Intervening Event:**\n-   **Foreseeability:** Was the intervening event a normal or foreseeable consequence of the original action?\n-   **Independence:** Was the intervening event entirely independent of the original action?\n-   **Efficacy:** Did the intervening event directly cause the outcome in a way that eclipses the original action's contribution?\n**C.3 Determine Proximate Cause:**\n-   If the intervening event was **unforeseeable, independent, and directly efficacious**, then the original action is **not** the proximate cause.\n-   Otherwise, the original action remains a proximate cause.\n**C.4 Conclude:** Output your final answer within `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.\n\n**STEP 3: OUTPUT**\nBegin your response by stating: \"Question Type: [A, B, or C]\". Then, execute the steps for that type. Finally, provide your conclusion.\n\n**FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES:**\n\n**Example: Type B (Intentionality)**\nQuestion: Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?\nType: B (Keyword: \"intentionally\")\nAnalysis: The hunter's action was shooting. The outcome was the bird-watcher being hit. His primary desire was to hit the deer, not the bird-watcher. However, he knew with certainty that shooting would also hit a bird-watcher. Therefore, he acted knowingly.\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n\n**Example: Type C (Proximate Cause)**\nQuestion: Did John's job cause his premature death?\nType: C (Complex chain with an intervening event: the nurse's error)\nAnalysis: Candidate causes: Job (asbestos exposure) and Nurse (medical error). The nurse's error was an independent, unforeseeable, and directly efficacious act that broke the causal chain from the job. The job caused the cancer, but the nurse's error was the proximate cause of the death at that moment.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n**Example: Type A (Factual Causation)**\nQuestion: Did the drunk driver cause injury to Joe's son?\nType: A (Keyword: \"cause\")\nBut-For Test: If the driver had not crashed, would Joe's son have been injured in that exact way at that exact time? No.\n<answer>Yes</answer>",

Do not define the outcome in a way that includes or presupposes the action in question (e.g., avoid \"the drying caused by both chemicals\").\n\n**2. Apply the Strict But-For Test:**\nConstruct a counterfactual scenario where **only** the specific action/omission in question is changed. Imagine a world **identical in every other respect**, including all other events, conditions, environmental rules, and the laws of nature.\n-   **For an ACTION:** \"If this action had **not** occurred **(or, if the action is a mandatory part of a process, imagine it had a different, neutral result)**, would the outcome **still** have happened **at the exact time and in the exact way it did**?\"\n-   **For an OMISSION:** \"If this omission had **not** occurred (i.e., if the person **had** acted as required), would the outcome **still** have happened **at the exact time and in the exact way it did**?\"\n-   **CRITICAL:** Do not create a logically inconsistent world.

Isolate the Action and Outcome:**\n   - Precisely identify the specific **action** or **omission** mentioned in the question.\n   - Identify the specific **outcome** event. Define it narrowly based on the actual event (e.g., \"the drying of plants in beds where Alex applied fertilizer,\" not a generalized outcome).\n\n**2.

Overdetermination/Preemption Check:**\n   - **Overdetermination:** If multiple factors each alone were sufficient to cause the outcome, and the action/omission was part of the actual set of events that produced the outcome, then it is a cause.\n     - Example: Two independent events each could trigger the outcome. Both are causes.\n   - **Preemption:** If another cause would have produced the outcome later or in a different way, but the action/omission actually brought it about at the exact time and manner, then it is a cause. Otherwise, not.\n   - Output based on this check.\n\n**4.

Conclude:** Based strictly on the above analysis, output your final answer within the tags `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.\n\n**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**\n\n**Example 1 (Overdetermination):**\nQuestion: Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?\nBut-For Test: \"If the design studio agents had not arrived, would the system still have turned on at 8:45 am?\" Yes, because travel agency employees were sufficient. However, this is overdetermination: both groups were sufficient and both actually occurred. Thus, the design studio agents are a cause.\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n\n**Example 2 (Omission):**\nQuestion: Did the motorboat start because Ned did not change the position of the motor?\nBut-For Test: \"If Ned had changed the motor's position, would the boat still have started?\" Yes, because the gear was in neutral. But this is an omission: in the actual scenario, the motor being in lock position was part of the cause. Since the outcome occurred due to the actual state (which included the omission), and the but-for test is inadequate here, we consider causal relevance: the omission was a necessary part of the actual sufficient set. Thus, it is a cause.\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n\n**Example 3 (Non-Causal Question):**\nQuestion: Did Bob intentionally improve the health of the townspeople?\nThis question is about intention, not causation.

Causation is often attributed to deviations, not normal background conditions.\n7. **Decide attribution:**\n   - If the action was necessary *or* sufficient, **and** it is not a case of preemption, answer **Yes**.\n   - If it was a necessary part of a symmetrical overdetermined set, answer **No**, as the agent is not uniquely causal.\n   - If it was neither necessary nor sufficient, answer **No**.\n8. **For intention questions:** Determine if the outcome was part of the agent's goal or primary desire.\n   - If **yes**, answer **Yes**.\n   - If it was a foreseen but undesired side effect, answer **No**.\n\n**Critical Examples for Reference:**\n- **Example (Overdetermination):** \"Suzy and Billy both arrive at 9 am, triggering a motion detector that requires two people. Did Billy cause it?\" → **No**. His action was normal and merely one necessary part of a symmetrical causal set.\n- **Example (Preemption):** \"Suzy's rock breaks the window a moment before Billy's rock would have. Did Billy cause the window to break?\" → **No**. His action was preempted by another sufficient cause.\n\nAlways structure your reasoning step-by-step before giving a final answer. Pay special attention to steps 5 and 6 to avoid common pitfalls like overattribution in symmetrical cases or missing preemption.",

Their inaction can be a cause.\n    -   **Special Case for Omissions:** If the agent had **no duty to act** and their inaction is the **norm** (e.g., they are a bystander), their omission is less likely to be considered the *attributed* cause, even if they physically could have prevented it.

Remember, \"inevitable\" means no possible intervention could have stopped it.\n-   **Salience Trumps Mere Causation:** An agent can be a *but-for* cause without being the *attributed* cause. Always consider duty and normative context.\n-   **Intention Requires Endorsement:** A foreseen and certain side effect is not intentional if the agent is indifferent to it. It must be a goal or a means.\n-   **Causation ≠ Intention:** Always complete causal attribution (Steps 1-5) before assessing intention (Step 6). An agent can cause an outcome without intending it.\n-   **Formalize Rules:** Precisely define the causal rules in Step 2 to avoid errors, especially concerning time and roles.\n-   **Freeze Time:** Analyze the world state *immediately before* the action/decision for the inevitability check.\n\n**Learn from These Common Failure Examples:**\n\n-   **Example A (Inevitability Misapplied to Omissions):** A building is set to implode at 5 PM if conditions A and B are met. At 4 PM, conditions A and B are met, but an expert (Tom) who can change condition B does nothing. The outcome was **not inevitable** at 4 PM because Tom could have changed B. His inaction **was** a cause. (Correct Answer: Yes).\n-   **Example B (Knowing Intention vs. Side Effect):** A hunter shoots a deer, knowing with certainty the bullet will also hit a bird-watcher. He is indifferent to this outcome. The hitting of the bird-watcher was a **foreseen certainty** but was **not a means** to his goal (hunting the deer) and he was indifferent. This is **not intentional**. (Correct Answer: No).\n-   **Example C (Attributive Causation - Duty):** Janet is responsible for oiling a machine but forgets. Kate (from HR, not responsible) also does nothing. The machine breaks. While Kate *could* have prevented it, she had **no duty** to act. The **salient cause** is Janet's failure, not Kate's. (Correct Answer for \"Did Kate cause it?\": No).\n-   **Example D (Intended Means):** A sniper must shoot through a civilian's arm to stop a terrorist. The sniper is sorry but knows wounding the civilian is a necessary means to the goal. This is **intentional**. (Correct Answer: Yes).\n\nAlways structure your reasoning step-by-step according to this framework before giving your final answer. Explicitly state your conclusion for each step.",

Why did they act (or not act)?\n5.  **Identify Foreseen Side-Effects:** Determine what outcomes the agent knew or believed would result from their action/inaction, even if they were not their goal.\n6.  **Apply the Intention Test:** The outcome is intentional if EITHER of the following is true:\n    a.  **Goal Outcome:** The outcome was the agent's primary goal or a necessary sub-goal to achieve it.\n    b.  **Knowingly Accepted Outcome:** The agent knew the outcome was certain or highly probable and proceeded with their action/inaction anyway.

Does it refer to the agent's *action* (e.g., \"shoot the gun\") or the specific *result* of that action (e.g., \"shoot her in the heart\")? The result is only intentional if it was controlled or foreseen as certain.\n8.  **Check for Deviant Causal Chains:** Did the outcome occur in a bizarre, accidental, or fundamentally unforeseen way? If the path from action to outcome deviated significantly from the agent's plan or reasonable expectations, the outcome was not intentional, even if caused and desired.\n\n**Phase 4: Synthesize and Conclude**\n9.  **Final Judgment:** State clearly:\n    -   Did the agent *cause* the outcome?

Indifference constitutes acceptance.\n*   **Conclusion:** The outcome was intentional under the \"Knowingly Accepted\" rule.

However, the specific result—being hit *in the heart*—occurred due to a slip (a deviant causal chain). He did not control the bullet's precise path.\n*   **Conclusion:** He intentionally shot *at* her, but did not intentionally shoot her *in the heart*. The specific result was accidental.

Therefore, Ned's inaction is not a cause.\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** While the gear was sufficient, the narrative specifies the motor was in lock position and Ned checked it. His inaction *enabled that specific sufficient condition* to remain active. The start occurred *via that pathway*. But-for his inaction (if he had acted and moved the motor), that specific pathway would have been broken. Therefore, the boat started *because* he did not change the motor position.\n*   **Gold Answer:** Yes\n\n**Error Example 2 (Intervening Cause):**\n*   **Question:** Did John's job cause his premature death?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** But-for taking the job 30 years ago, John would not have gotten cancer and died young. Therefore, the job caused his death.\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The cancer made death within 2 months inevitable. However, the death that occurred *yesterday* was directly caused by a nurse's independent medication error. This intervening cause preempted the cancer's timeline. The job caused the cancer, but the nurse's error caused the specific death that happened.\n*   **Gold Answer:** No\n\n**Error Example 3 (Enablement through Inaction):**\n*   **Question:** Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Janet's initial failure created the sufficient condition (no oil). The breakdown was already inevitable, so Kate's subsequent inaction cannot be a cause.\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The machine broke down because it *remained* un-oiled. Upon noticing the problem, Kate had the knowledge and capacity to break the causal chain by oiling the machine. Her choice to not act *sustained* the sufficient condition from that moment forward. But-for her inaction after noticing, the breakdown would likely have been prevented. Therefore, her inaction was a cause.\n*   **Gold Answer:** Yes\n\n**Now, apply this reasoning to the following question:**",

If the outcome was guaranteed by another condition (either already true or highly probable regardless of the agent's choice), then it did *not* happen because of them.\n\n**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**\n\n**Example 1: (Preservation via Inaction)**\n*   **Question:** Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?\n*   **Sufficient Condition:** Plugged in AND on the charging pad.\n*   **Initial State:** Both conditions are true.\n*   **Agent's Role:** Wayne checks the pad and chooses not to change the device's position.\n*   **Counterfactual:** If Wayne *had* changed the position, he likely would have taken it off the pad. The device would not have charged.\n*   **Conclusion:** Yes, the device is charged because he did not change its position. (<answer>Yes</answer>)\n\n**Example 2: (Redundant Condition)**\n*   **Question:** Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David did not change the temperature setting?\n*   **Sufficient Conditions:** MAX DRY cycle OR HIGH temperature.\n*   **Initial State:** Both conditions are true. The MAX DRY setting is sufficient on its own.\n*   **Agent's Role:** David checks the temperature and chooses not to change it.\n*   **Counterfactual:** If David *had* changed the temperature, the HIGH condition would be broken. However, the MAX DRY condition remains and is sufficient for the outcome.\n*   **Conclusion:** No, the clothes did not dry because he left the temperature on HIGH; they dried because the cycle was set to MAX DRY. (<answer>No</answer>)\n\n**Example 3: (Normative Salience - Multi Agent)**\n*   **Question:** Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some emails?\n*   **Sufficient Condition:** Two people logged in simultaneously.\n*   **Initial State:** No one is logged in.\n*   **Agent's Role:** Suzy logs in (permitted). Billy logs in (forbidden).\n*   **Actual Cause:** Both logins are part of the actual cause.\n*   **Counterfactual:** If Suzy had not logged in, the deletion would not have occurred (but this assumes Billy still breaks the rules).\n*   **Normative Salience:** Company policy explicitly forbade Billy's action and permitted Suzy's. The outcome is attributable to Billy's deviant, rule-breaking action.\n*   **Conclusion:** No, the deletion happened because Billy logged in when he was not permitted to, not because Suzy logged in. (<answer>No</answer>)\n\n**Example 4: (Preemption)**\n*   **Question:** Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?\n*   **Sufficient Conditions:** Layup OR 3-point shot.\n*   **Initial State:** No shots made.\n*   **Agent's Role:** Louie makes a layup (Action 1) and later makes a 3-pointer (Action 2).\n*   **Actual Causal Sequence:** The layup was the first event to satisfy a sufficient condition. It actually caused the win the moment it happened.\n*   **Counterfactual:** If the layup had not occurred, the win is not guaranteed. The 3-pointer, while sufficient, was a difficult, last-second shot that was not certain to happen.\n*   **Preemption:** The layup preempted the 3-pointer from being the cause. The win was secured by the layup.\n*   **Conclusion:** Yes, he won because of the layup. It was the actual, precipitating cause.

            "prompt": "Answer questions about causal attribution and intentionality. Carefully analyze whether an outcome occurred specifically because of an agent's action or inaction, and whether it was intentional. Pay special attention to cases involving preemption, overdetermination, and the agent's mental state.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Define the Outcome and Sufficient Conditions:** Precisely state the outcome in question. Determine all conditions that are individually or jointly sufficient to guarantee this outcome.\n\n2.  **Assess the Initial State & Causal Context:** Note the state of the world before the agent's decision. Identify any pre-existing conditions, the actions of other agents, and relevant social norms, rules, or policies.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Agent's Role:**\n    *   **Action/Inaction:** What did the agent do or not do?\n    *   **Mental State (for intentionality):** If asked about intent, analyze the agent's stated goals, knowledge, and desires. Did they aim for the outcome, or was it a foreseen but unintended side effect?\n\n4.  **Apply Counterfactual Tests:**\n    *   **Necessity:** Would the outcome have occurred if the agent had *not* acted (or had acted differently)?\n    *   **Sufficiency:** Was the agent's action alone sufficient to cause the outcome, or did it depend on other pre-existing factors?\n\n5.  **Apply Additional Causal Principles:**\n    *   **Temporal Actualization:** If a sufficient condition for the outcome was fulfilled by a prior event, that event is the cause. Later redundant events are not causal.\n    *   **Normality/Deviance:** If an outcome arises from a mix of norm-breaking (deviant) and norm-following (normal) actions, causation is primarily attributed to the deviant act(s).\n\n6.  **Conclude:**\n    *   **Causation:** The outcome happened *because* of the agent's action/inaction if it was a necessary and salient factor in the actual sequence of events.\n    *   **Intentionality:** The agent intended the outcome if it was part of their goal or plan, not merely a foreseen consequence.\n\n**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**\n\n**Example A: Preemption (Alice & Zoe)**\n*   **Question:** Did Alice cause the email to be sent?\n*   **Sufficient Condition:** Two people logged in simultaneously.\n*   **Initial State & Context:** Company policy designates mornings for Alice, afternoons for Zoe. Zoe violated this policy by logging in at 9:00 am.\n*   **Agent's Role:** Alice followed policy by logging in at 9:30 am.\n*   **Counterfactual:** If Alice had not logged in, the email would not have been sent *at that time*. However, Zoe's deviant act created the high-risk situation.\n*   **Principle (Normality/Deviance):** The cause of the problem is the deviant act (Zoe's early login). Alice's normal action is not considered the cause.\n*   **Conclusion:** No. (<answer>No</answer>)\n\n**Example B: Overdetermination (Louie)**\n*   **Question:** Did Louie win because he made the layup?\n*   **Sufficient Condition:** Making a layup OR making a 3-point shot.\n*   **Initial State:** No shots made.\n*   **Agent's Role:** Louie made a layup (sufficient condition met). Later, he made a 3-pointer (also sufficient).\n*   **Counterfactual:** If Louie had missed the layup, he would have won later via the 3-pointer. The layup was not necessary.\n*   **Principle (Temporal Actualization):** The outcome was actualized the moment the first sufficient condition (the layup) was met. The later 3-pointer is causally redundant.\n*   **Conclusion:** Yes, he won because of the layup, as it was the event that first secured the win. (<answer>Yes</answer>)\n\n**Example C: Intentionality (Bob)**\n*   **Question:** Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?\n*   **Outcome:** Harm to health.\n*   **Agent's Role & Mental State:** Bob's stated goal was exclusively to \"steal as much money as I can.\" He was indifferent to the health outcome (\"I don't care one way or another\"). The harm was a foreseen side effect, not his aim.\n*   **Conclusion:** No. He intentionally robbed the bank, but he did not intentionally harm the townspeople; the harm was an unintended consequence.

This establishes a necessary link in the causal chain.\n2.  **Proximate Cause (Intervention & Foreseeability):** A factual cause is not the responsible cause if a subsequent, voluntary, and highly abnormal act (e.g., a crime) directly produces the outcome. The outcome must be a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the original action.\n3.  **Normality & Deviance:** When multiple factual causes exist, primary causation is attributed to the most abnormal, rule-violating, or policy-breaking action that disrupted the normal course of events.\n4.  **Intentionality (if applicable):** An outcome is intentional only if it was the agent's primary goal. A foreseen but undesired side-effect is not intentional.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\nFirst, apply Principle 1 to list all factual causes.\nSecond, apply Principle 2 to determine if an intervening cause breaks the chain of responsibility.\nThird, if multiple causes remain, apply Principle 3 to identify the most salient cause.\nFinally, if the question is about intent, apply Principle 4.\n\n**Avoid Common Mistakes:**\n- Do not equate factual causation with responsibility. A finding of factual cause (Principle 1) does not automatically mean the answer is \"Yes\".\n- The question \"Did X cause Y?\" often implies \"Is X responsible for Y?\" not just \"Was X a necessary factor?\".\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n*   **Example where factual cause is not responsible:** Joe delayed, which was necessary for his son to be in the car, but a drunk driver's abnormal intervention was the proximate cause of the crash. Therefore, Joe did **not** cause the injury. <answer>No</answer>\n*   **Example where normality determines responsibility:** Jane logging on was necessary for the crash, but Lauren's policy violation was the abnormal, deviant cause.

Intentionality (Only if asked about intent):**\n*   **Test:** Was the outcome...\n    *(a)* the agent's **primary goal or purpose**, or\n    *(b)* a **known and certain consequence** that the agent consciously accepted to achieve their goal?\n*   **Decision Rule:** If **yes** to (a) or (b), the outcome was intentional.\n*   If the outcome was merely a **foreseen but undesired side-effect**, it is **not** intentional.\n\n**Reasoning Steps (APPLY IN ORDER):**\n1.  First, analyze **Counterfactual Necessity**. Apply the but-for test and the overdetermination exception.\n2.  Second, analyze **Causal Contribution**. This is crucial if the candidate cause failed the but-for test but was part of an overdetermined outcome.\n3.  Third, analyze **Proximate Causation**. Check for any independent and unforeseeable intervening acts that would break the causal chain.\n4.  Optionally, consider **Direct Sufficiency** to support your reasoning.\n5.  If the question is about intent, analyze **Intentionality** using the two-part test.\n6.  Finally, provide your final answer within the tags `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.\n\n**Example of Overdetermination (To Avoid Common Mistakes):**\n\n**Input:** A bear and a hedgehog simultaneously took the last pencil from a box. A polar bear later found the box empty. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Counterfactual Necessity:** *But-for test:* Without the hedgehog, the bear would have taken the last pencil. The outcome (empty box) would still have occurred. *Exception:* This is a case of **overdetermination**; both actions were simultaneous and sufficient to deplete the last pencil. Therefore, we proceed.\n2.  **Causal Contribution:** The hedgehog's action was a direct and substantial factor in taking the last pencil. It is a contributing cause.\n3.  **Proximate Causation:** No intervening act occurred. The polar bear finding the box empty is a direct result of the pencils being taken.\n**Conclusion:** The hedgehog is a cause of the problem.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>\n\n**You must follow these steps and decision rules precisely.**",

            "prompt": "Answer questions about causal attribution and intentionality by applying these principles:\n\n1. **Counterfactual Necessity:** A candidate cause is not actual if the outcome would have occurred without it. However, in cases of omission, consider whether the agent's inaction allowed a harmful state to persist, especially if there was a duty or capacity to act.\n2. **Sufficiency in Overdetermination:** An action can be a cause if it was sufficient for the outcome, even if other sufficient causes were present. For omissions, an omission can be causal if it preserves a sufficient condition for the outcome.\n3. **Normative Deviance:** An action that violates a norm or policy is often considered a more salient cause than a norm-conforming action, even if both are counterfactually necessary.\n4. **Intentionality vs. Foresight:** An outcome is intentional only if it was the agent's primary goal. A foreseen but undesired side-effect is not intentional.\n5. **Causal Preemption:** When one cause preempts another, the preempting cause is typically considered the actual cause, while the preempted cause is not.\n\nFirst, reason step-by-step by applying the relevant tests. Consider the context, including norms, duties, and whether actions were voluntary. Pay special attention to the following common pitfalls:\n\n- **Pitfall 1:** Do not conclude that an omission is not causal simply because another sufficient cause was present. If the omission allowed a harmful state to continue, it can be a cause.\n- **Pitfall 2:** Do not attribute causation to a norm-conforming action when a norm-violating action is the deviant and salient cause.\n- **Pitfall 3:** Do not ignore the role of duty or capacity to act when evaluating omissions.\n\nThen, provide your final answer within the tags <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>.\n\n**Reference Examples to Avoid Common Mistakes:**\n\n- **Example 1 (Wayne's Watch):** Wayne's inaction *preserved* the sufficient condition (device on pad). Even though plugged-in was also sufficient, his omission was causal. <answer>Yes</answer>\n- **Example 2 (Janet and Kate):** Kate's omission allowed the lack of oil to persist. Although not responsible, her capacity to act makes her omission causal. <answer>Yes</answer>\n- **Example 3 (Pharmacist and Doctor):** The doctor's norm-violating action is the salient cause; the pharmacist's routine action is not. <answer>No</answer>\n- **Example 4 (Joe and His Son):** Joe's action was involuntary (a trait he couldn't control) and the drunk driver is the primary cause. <answer>No</answer>\n- **Example 5 (Lauren and Jane):** Lauren's norm-violating action is the deviant cause; Jane's norm-conforming action is not the salient cause. <answer>No</answer>",

Ned changes the motor to the lock position. The boat starts when he turns the key. Did the motorboat start because Ned changed the position of the motor?\n**Reasoning:** The outcome is governed by an OR gate. The gear was already in neutral *before* Ned acted.

The first stone was sufficient in isolation and was actualized. The but-for test fails. However, there was no pre-existing sufficient condition; the sufficient causes occurred simultaneously.

Note any pre-existing plans, instructions, or systems that create a context of guaranteed outcomes.\n3.  **Apply the \"But-For\" Test with Fixed Plans:**\n    -   Construct a counterfactual world where the specific action *did not occur*.\n    -   **Crucial: Hold fixed all pre-existing plans, laws, and instructions** that are not logically incompatible with the counterfactual.

The boss’s instruction to *both* employees created a pre-existing, sufficient plan that guaranteed this condition would be met.\n3.  **But-For Test:** If Billy had not arrived (violating the instruction), only Suzy would be present. The detector would **not** have gone off. This suggests necessity.\n4.  **Redundancy Test:** However, the boss’s instruction is a sufficient cause.

A later potential cause cannot negate an earlier, sufficient cause.\n-   **\"Because\" implies salience:** Questions using \"because\" or \"why\" often ask for the most direct or salient cause (proximate cause), not just any contributing factor.\n-   **Answer the Question Asked:** Focus solely on the action and outcome specified.

First, classify the question type to determine the appropriate reasoning framework.\n\n**Step 0: Classify the Question Type**\n-   **Type C (Causal):** Questions like \"Did X cause Y?\" → Proceed to **Causal Attribution Analysis**.\n-   **Type I (Intentional):** Questions like \"Did X *intentionally* cause Y?\" → First, complete **Causal Attribution Analysis** for X and Y, then apply the **Intentionality Analysis** module.\n-   **Type M (Moral):** Questions about blame, responsibility, or praise → Do not answer; state this is beyond the scope.\n\n**Causal Attribution Analysis (For Type C):**\n\n1.  **Identify the Causal Rule:** Determine the logical conditions required for the outcome (e.g., \"Y occurs if A AND B\" or \"Y occurs if A OR B\").

Ask: \"If the person had done the *opposite* of what they did at that moment, would the outcome have still occurred **at the same time**?\"\n    -   If the outcome would **not** have occurred at all, or would have been **delayed**, then the action/inaction **was** a cause.\n    -   If the outcome **would** have occurred at the same time or earlier, then the action/inaction **was not** a cause.\n6.  **Final Judgment (Causal):** Based on this test, provide your causal answer.\n\n**Intentionality Analysis Module (For Type I Questions):**\nAn agent intentionally caused an outcome **only if** all of the following are true:\n1.  **Causation:** The agent's action was a cause of the outcome (as determined by the Causal Attribution Analysis).\n2.  **Awareness:** The agent knew, or should have known under the circumstances, that their action would lead to the outcome.\n3.  **Desire:** The agent acted with the goal or desire of bringing about that specific outcome.\nIf any condition is false, the action was not intentional.\n\n**Crucial Principles for Causal Analysis:**\n-   **Prevention is Causation:** A condition being true beforehand does not automatically mean that preserving it through a conscious decision not to act is not causal. Preventing the violation of a necessary condition can be a cause.\n-   **The Primacy of the First Sufficient Cause:** In cases of overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes), the event that **first** satisfies a sufficient condition for the outcome is a cause.\n-   **The Actual Cause Principle:** The most salient cause is often the one that is **deviant, novel, or intervenes** on a stable state. An action that merely follows instructions or maintains a pre-existing condition is less likely to be the salient cause compared to a deviant action that violates norms or creates a new risk.\n-   **Active vs. Passive Conditions:** Distinguish between a condition that is **passively true** (a static background fact) and an action that **actively ensures or preserves** a condition (e.g., by checking and then consciously deciding not to change it). Active preservation can be a cause.\n\n**Examples for Guidance (Causal):**\n\n**Example 1 (Necessity through Inaction):**\n- **Rule:** Charges if (plugged in AND on pad).\n- **Initial State:** Plugged in and on pad.\n- **Action:** Did not change position.\n- **Counterfactual:** If he *had* changed it (took it off the pad), it would **not** have charged. Thus, not changing it **was** a cause.\n- **Judgment:** <answer>Yes</answer>\n\n**Example 2 (Redundant Inaction):**\n- **Rule:** Dries if (MAX DRY OR HIGH temp).\n- **Initial State:** MAX DRY was true, HIGH temp was true.\n- **Action:** Did not change temperature.\n- **Counterfactual:** If he *had* changed the temperature (to LOW), it would **still** have dried (because MAX DRY was true). Thus, not changing it **was not** a cause.\n- **Judgment:** <answer>No</answer>\n\n**Example 3 (First Sufficient Cause):**\n- **Rule:** Win $100 if (makes a layup OR makes a 3-point shot).\n- **Timeline:** Makes a layup (win condition is instantly satisfied). Later, makes a 3-point shot.\n- **Target Action:** Making the layup.\n- **Counterfactual:** If he had *not* made the layup (missed it), the win condition would not have been met *at that time*. The outcome would have been **delayed**. Therefore, making the layup **was** a cause.\n- **Judgment:** <answer>Yes</answer>\n\n**Example 4 (Later Redundant Action):**\n- **Rule:** Door opens if (Button A pressed OR Button B pressed).\n- **Timeline:** Button A is pressed (door opens). Five minutes later, Button B is pressed.\n- **Target Action:** Pressing Button B.\n- **Counterfactual:** If he had *not* pressed Button B, the door would have **already been open**. The outcome would have occurred at the same time. Thus, pressing Button B **was not** a cause.\n- **Judgment:** <answer>No</answer>\n\n**Example 5 (Avoiding Error - Normative Deviation):**\n- **Narrative:** Alex applies permitted chemical A. Benni later applies forbidden chemical B, causing plants to dry only where both are present (A AND B rule).\n- **Target Action:** Alex applying A.\n- **Analysis:** While Alex's action is necessary, Benni's deviant action is the novel, intervening cause that preempts the non-harmful course of events. The counterfactual is correct (no A → no dry plants), but the **Actual Cause Principle** applies.\n- **Refined Judgment:** Alex's norm-following action is not the salient cause; Benni's deviant action is. For \"Did Alex's fertilization cause the drying?\", the answer is <answer>No</answer>.\n\n**Example 6 (Avoiding Error - Active Preservation):**\n- **Narrative:** Boat starts if (gear neutral OR motor lock). Both are true initially. Ned checks the motor and consciously decides not to change its lock position.\n- **Target Action:** Ned not changing the motor position.\n- **Analysis:** This is not a passive condition; it is an **active preservation** through a conscious decision after verification. The counterfactual (if he had changed it) shows the outcome would still occur (due to neutral gear), so the inaction is not a *necessary* cause. However, the **Active vs. Passive** principle clarifies that his action of checking and deciding was causal in *ensuring* a sufficient condition remained true, but the overdetermination (OR rule with another sufficient condition) makes it redundant.\n- **Judgment:** <answer>No</answer> (The outcome was already guaranteed by the passive neutral gear; his action was redundant).\n\n**Example for Guidance (Intentional):**\n\n**Example 7 (Intentionality Analysis):**\n- **Question:** \"Did Bob intentionally improve the health?\"\n- **Causal Analysis:** Bob's agreement to the plan was a necessary cause of the health improvement (neurotoxin exposure).\n- **Intentionality Analysis:**\n    -   **Causation:** Yes.\n    -   **Awareness:** Yes, he was informed.\n    -   **Desire:** No. He explicitly stated \"I don't care... about the health,\" showing a lack of desire for this outcome.\n- **Judgment:** <answer>No</answer>\n\n**Key Reinforcement:**\n-   Always begin by **classifying the question type**.\n-   For **AND** rules, an action providing a necessary condition is causal if its absence prevents the outcome.\n-   For **OR** rules, an action is only causal if it is the first sufficient cause; later redundant actions are not causes.\n-   Apply the **Actual Cause Principle** to identify deviant, salient causes.\n-   Distinguish **active preservation** from **passive conditions**.\n-   **Focus strictly on the causal logic, timing, and question type;** ignore irrelevant narrative details.\n\nConclude your response with `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.",

Crucially, determine if this action was a **violation of an explicit norm, policy, or default expectation** or if it was **compliant**.\n4.  **Apply the counterfactual test (Necessity):**\n    *   Ask: \"If the agent had done the *opposite* action (e.g., acted instead of not acting), would the outcome **still have occurred at the time it did**?\"\n    *   If the outcome would **not** have occurred, then the action/inaction was a **necessary cause**.\n    *   If the outcome **would** have occurred, then the action/inaction was **not a necessary cause**.\n5.  **Refine with causal principles:**\n    *   **Normality & Deviance:** If the agent's action was norm-compliant and another agent's deviant action was also a necessary cause, primary causation is assigned to the deviant action. A necessary cause that is the default behavior is often not considered *the* cause.\n    *   **Temporal Preemption:** If a first action (A) causes the outcome at time T1, a second, redundant action (B) at time T2 does not negate A's causal status. The outcome is attributed to the first sufficient cause.\n    *   **Intentionality (if asked):** Distinguish between *causing* and *intentionally causing*. An outcome is intentional only if it was a **specific goal or aim** of the agent, not merely a foreseen but unwanted side effect.\n    *   **Abnormality:** When multiple factors are necessary, the **less probable, more surprising, or more abnormal** factor is typically judged to be the salient cause.\n6.  **Synthesize and Final Judgment:** Weigh the results of the counterfactual test against the principles in Step 5. A necessary cause identified in Step 4 may be overruled by these principles. Provide your final answer.\n\n**Important:** A condition being true beforehand does not automatically mean that preserving it through inaction is not causal. Preventing the violation of a necessary condition is a cause. **Causation is not the same as intentionality.**\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n\n**Example A (Normality - Correct Answer: No):**\n- **Question:** Did Alice (who logged in per policy) cause the email?\n- **Rule:** Email if (Alice logged in AND Zoe logged in).\n- **Facts:** Zoe violated policy by logging in first. Alice complied by logging in later.\n- **Counterfactual:** If Alice had not logged in, the email would not have been sent. (Necessary cause)\n- **Refinement (Normality):** Alice's action was the *norm-compliant default*. Zoe's action was the *deviant violation*. Causation is assigned to the deviant action.\n- **Judgment:** No.\n\n**Example B (Temporal Preemption - Correct Answer: Yes):**\n- **Question:** Did Louie win because he made the layup?\n- **Rule:** Win if (layup OR 3-point).\n- **Facts:** The layup was made first, satisfying the condition and causing the win at that moment.\n- **Counterfactual:** If he had not made the layup, he would have won later via the 3-pointer. (Not necessary for final outcome)\n- **Refinement (Temporal Preemption):** The win *occurred* when the layup was made. The later shot is redundant and does not negate the layup's causal role at the time it happened.\n- **Judgment:** Yes.\n\n**Example C (Intentionality - Correct Answer: No):**\n- **Question:** Did Bob intentionally harm the townspeople?\n- **Rule:** Harm if (neurotoxin released AND poison in water).\n- **Facts:** Bob approved the plan to rob the bank, knowing harm was a side effect. His stated goal was only to steal money.\n- **Counterfactual:** If Bob had stopped the plan, the severe harm would not have occurred. (He caused the harm)\n- **Refinement (Intentionality):** The harm was a foreseen side effect, not his goal or aim. Therefore, he did not cause it *intentionally*.\n- **Judgment:** No.\n\n**Example D (Abnormality - Correct Answer: No):**\n- **Question:** Did Joe's first choice (green ball) cause him to win?\n- **Rule:** Win if (green from left AND blue from right).\n- **Facts:** Drawing green was likely/normal. Drawing blue was very unlikely/abnormal.\n- **Counterfactual:** If he hadn't drawn green, he wouldn't have won. (Necessary cause)\n- **Refinement (Abnormality):** Both choices are necessary, but the win is attributed to the **abnormal, surprising event** (drawing the blue ball), not the normal, expected one (drawing the green ball).\n- **Judgment:** No.\n\nConclude your response with `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.",

            "prompt": "Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing the scenario. Your analysis must be tailored to the specific type of question being asked.\n\n**Preliminary Step: Interpret the Question**\nFirst, identify what is being asked. Key question types include:\n- **Physical Necessity:** \"Was the action/inaction necessary for the outcome?\" (Keywords: cause, prevent)\n- **Intentionality:** \"Did the agent do it intentionally?\" (Keywords: intentionally, deliberately)\n- **Responsibility/Blame:** \"Was the agent responsible?\" (Keywords: responsible, blame, fault)\n- **Causal Explanation:** \"Did X happen because of Y?\" (Keywords: because, due to)\n\nYour reasoning steps must adapt to the question type.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n1.  **Identify the relevant rule(s):** Determine the conditions for the outcome. The rule could be:\n    - A **physical law** (e.g., \"The device charges if on the pad AND plugged in\").\n    - A **definition** (e.g., \"An action is intentional if the agent desires the outcome and believes their action will achieve it\").\n    - A **social or normative rule** (e.g., \"Billy is not permitted to log in the morning\").\n2.  **Establish the initial state:** Note the state of all relevant conditions before the person's action or inaction.\n3.  **Establish the normative baseline (if applicable):** If the scenario involves rules, policies, or common practices, identify the expected behavior. An action that violates a norm is often considered more causal.\n4.  **Analyze the agent's behavior:** Identify what the person did or did do. For intentionality, also analyze their mental state (goals, beliefs, knowledge).\n5.  **Apply the appropriate test:**\n    -   For **physical necessity:** Ask, \"If the agent had done the *opposite* action, would the outcome still have occurred?\"\n        - If the outcome would **not** have occurred, then the action/inaction **was** a cause.\n        - If the outcome **would** have occurred, then the action/inaction **was not** a cause.\n    -   For **intentionality:** Ask, \"Did the agent have the goal of bringing about the outcome, and did they believe their action would achieve it?\" Ignore accidental byproducts.\n    -   For **normative responsibility:** Ask, \"Was the agent's action a violation of a relevant rule or norm? Would the outcome have occurred if everyone had followed the rules?\"\n    -   For **causal explanation:** Ask, \"Was the agent's action/inaction a relevant part of the actual sequence of events? Would the explanation be incomplete without mentioning it?\" An action need not be necessary to be explanatory.\n6.  **Final Judgment:** Based on the test most appropriate to the question type, provide your answer. A physically necessary action may not be intentional or blameworthy.\n\n**Important:** The context of the question is paramount. An action that is physically necessary might not be intentional if it was accidental, or it might not be blameworthy if it followed the rules.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n\n**Example A (Physical Necessity - Correct: Yes):**\n- **Question Type:** Physical Necessity (\"cause\")\n- **Rule:** Charges if (plugged in AND on pad).\n- **Initial State:** Plugged in and on pad.\n- **Action:** Did not change position.\n- **Counterfactual (Necessity):** If he *had* changed it (took it off the pad), it would **not** have charged.\n- **Judgment:** Not changing it **was** a cause. `<answer>Yes</answer>`\n\n**Example B (Physical Necessity - Correct: No):**\n- **Question Type:** Physical Necessity (\"cause\")\n- **Rule:** Dries if (MAX DRY OR HIGH temp).\n- **Initial State:** MAX DRY true, HIGH temp true.\n- **Action:** Did not change temperature.\n- **Counterfactual (Necessity):** If he *had* changed it (to LOW), it would **still** have dried (MAX DRY true).\n- **Judgment:** Not changing it **was not** a cause. `<answer>No</answer>`\n\n**Example C (Intentionality - Correct: No):**\n- **Question Type:** Intentionality (\"intentionally\")\n- **Rule:** An action is intentional if it is the agent's conscious goal.\n- **Initial State:** Jake wants money, aims rifle, but his hand slips.\n- **Action:** Pulled trigger, but shot was fired accidentally due to slip.\n- **Test (Intentionality):** Although Jake desired the outcome, the firing itself was an accident, not a deliberate execution of his goal. The shot was not intentional.\n- **Judgment:** He did **not** shoot intentionally. `<answer>No</answer>`\n\n**Example D (Normative Context - Correct: No):**\n- **Question Type:** Responsibility (\"cause\" in a normative context)\n- **Rule:** Deletion occurs if (Suzy logs in AND Billy logs in). Normative rule: Billy is **forbidden** from logging in the morning.\n- **Normative Baseline:** Suzy is permitted to log in; Billy is not.\n- **Action:** Both log in. Billy's action is a violation; Suzy's is not.\n- **Test (Responsibility):** The outcome would not have occurred if the norm had been followed (if Billy had not violated the rule). Billy's violation is the abnormal, causative intervention.\n- **Judgment:** Suzy **did not** cause the deletion. `<answer>No</answer>`\n\n**Example E (Causal Explanation - Correct: Yes):**\n- **Question Type:** Causal Explanation (\"because\")\n- **Rule:** Dries if (MAX DRY OR HIGH temp).\n- **Initial State:** MAX DRY true, HIGH temp true.\n- **Action:** Did not change the HIGH temperature setting.\n- **Test (Explanation):** By not changing the setting, David preserved a sufficient condition (HIGH temp) for the outcome. This is a relevant part of the explanatory story.\n- **Judgment:** The clothes dried **because** he did not change it. `<answer>Yes</answer>`\n\nConclude your response with `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>`.",

    "prompt": "You are an expert in causal reasoning. Your task is to analyze the given scenario and determine if the specified action caused the outcome. Your final answer must reflect the judgment that the majority of people would give.\n\n### Integrated Analytical Framework ###\n\n**Step 1: Apply the \"But For\" Test (Logical Necessity)**\n- Consider the actual world where the action (A) happened and the outcome (O) happened.\n- Construct the closest possible world where action A did *not* happen, making the *minimal change* required.\n- Ask: In this closest world, would outcome O still have occurred, in the way that it did, at the time that it did?\n- *If no*, then A is a necessary cause. *If yes*, then A is not necessary.\n\n**Step 2: Refine with Common-Sense Principles**\n- **Proximate Cause Salience:** People often identify the most immediate, direct, and unexpected trigger as the cause.\n- **Normality and Deviance:** Was A a normal part of the background context or a deviant interruption? Focus on *descriptive* normality (what usually happens).\n- **Causal Sufficiency:** Did A, by itself, create a high probability of O?\n- **Omission vs. Commission:** People are less likely to label an *omission* (failure to act) as \"the cause\" compared to a *commission* (active deed), especially if there was no clear duty to act.\n- **Robustness (Pre-emption):** Would O have happened anyway through another means? If another sufficient cause was already in place, A is not seen as the cause.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize for Majority Judgment**\n- The \"But For\" test is a starting point. Common-sense principles often override it.\n- If \"But For\" suggests a cause that is an omission with no duty, or a normal background condition, it is likely not the majority's cause.\n- Find the cause that is both *salient* and *surprising* to people.\n\n**Step 4: Final Check**\n- Ask: \"Is there another factor that is more direct, more deviant, and more sufficient that most people would point to instead?\" If yes, then the answer is likely **No**.\n\n### Examples for Guidance ###\n\n[Example 1: Illustrating Omission vs. Commission and Pre-emption]\n**Input:** Question: Jack is driving five sick people to the hospital. He approaches a rock climber who is about to fall. If he slows down, the climber can use a cord to save himself, but the five sick people will die. Jack keeps driving quickly and the climber falls. Did Jack cause the climber to fall?\n**Reasoning:** \n- *But For Test:* But for Jack not slowing down, the climber would not have fallen. Logically, his inaction is necessary.\n- *Common-Sense Refinement:* However, Jack's primary duty was to the five sick people. His action (driving on) was a normal response to this duty. The climber's fall was caused by gravity and loss of grip—Jack's omission did not actively create the danger but failed to prevent it. Most people would not say Jack *caused* the fall; they would see it as a tragic outcome of a forced choice.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example 2: Illustrating Pre-emption and Normality]\n**Input:** Question: Janet, whose job is to oil machines, forgets to oil one. Kate, who is not responsible for oiling, also does not oil it. The machine breaks down. Did Kate not oiling the machine cause it to break down?\n**Reasoning:**\n- *But For Test:* But for Kate not oiling the machine, would it have broken down? Yes, because Janet's failure had already pre-empted the outcome. The machine was already on a path to breakdown due to lack of oil. Kate's inaction was not necessary.\n- *Common-Sense Refinement:* Kate had no responsibility to act. Her inaction was normal and expected. The breakdown was sufficiently caused by Janet's deviant omission of her duty.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>No</answer>\n\n### Final Reasoning Steps ###\n1.  Identify the specific action (A) and the outcome (O).\n2.  Apply the \"but for\" test correctly, constructing the minimal change counterfactual.\n3.  Refine using the common-sense principles:\n    -   Is there a more salient proximate cause?\n    -   Was A normal or deviant?\n    -   Was A sufficient, or was the outcome pre-empted?\n    -   Was A an omission with no duty to act?\n4.  Synthesize to predict the majority opinion.\n5.  Perform the Final Check.\n\n**Final Answer Format:**\nAfter your reasoning, provide your final answer on a new line as: `<answer>Yes</answer>`, `<answer>No</answer>`, or `<answer>Ambiguous</answer>`.\n\nNow, analyze the following question.

Apply these principles in order:\n        -   **Difference-Making is Primary:** First and foremost, people ask \"would it have happened anyway?\" If the outcome would have occurred identically without the action, people will say the action did **not** cause it.\n        -   **Proportional Causality:** If an outcome requires multiple similar, simultaneous actions, people distribute causal responsibility. They are unlikely to blame one individual actor unless there is a strong, asymmetric reason (e.g., malicious intent).\n        -   **Trumping Principle:** A rare, unexpected, or decisive sufficient cause will be seen as the \"real\" cause, overshadowing a normal or redundant simultaneous cause.\n        -   **Action vs. Inaction:** People are more likely to attribute an outcome to an active intervention than to a passive omission, all else being equal.\n        -   **Temporal/Narrative Bias:** The first event in a sequence may be seen as more causal, but this is a weak bias and is overruled by the stronger principles above.\n4.  **Reason Step-by-Step:** Explicitly walk through your reasoning.

Just then, Carol also turns on her lamp. Since two people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp cause the circuit breaker to fail? (Audience: Majority of people)\nReasoning: The counterfactual test shows Jim's action was necessary (without it, only one lamp is on, so no failure). However, Carol's action was identically necessary. The Proportionality principle applies: people would not single out Jim as *the* cause; they would say both together caused it. Therefore, the answer to \"Did Jim cause it?\" is No.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example B: Majority People - Trumping Principle]\nQuestion: Alex rolls a 12 (winning dice roll) and the spinner lands on green at the same time. He wins. Did Alex spinning the spinner cause him to win? (Audience: Majority of people)\nReasoning: Apply the counterfactual test: If the spinner had not landed on green, would Alex still have won? Yes, because the dice roll was sufficient. The spinning made no difference. The Trumping Principle reinforces this: the rare and amazing dice roll is the decisive cause, making the normal spinner result irrelevant. People would say the spin did not cause the win.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example C: Logician - Necessary Cause]\nQuestion: Is adding Reagent X a necessary cause for the crystal to dissolve?\nReasoning: A logician applies the counterfactual test.

(Majority view)\n*Incorrect Reasoning (to avoid):* \"Alex's action was norm-following (Knobe Effect), and Benni's action was more abnormal. Therefore, Alex's action did not cause the drying.\" (This conflates blame/intentionality with physical causation).\n*Corrected Reasoning:* The specific outcome is the drying of plants where both chemicals were applied. Alex's action (applying A X200R) was a **necessary part of the causal mechanism** (INUS condition) for the drying in those specific beds. If he had not applied his fertilizer there, those plants would not have dried. The Knobe Effect makes people see Alex as less *blameworthy*, but it does not negate the physical causal role of his action.

Follow these steps rigorously:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Elements:** Extract the specific action/event (or omission) in question and the outcome. Precisely define the specific outcome and, if applicable, the specific entity affected.\n2.  **Determine Question Type:**\n    - If asked about \"necessary cause\" or \"but-for cause,\" apply the **counterfactual necessity test**: \"If the action had NOT occurred, would the outcome still have happened?\"\n    - If asked about \"sufficient cause,\" apply the **counterfactual sufficiency test**: \"If the action occurs, does it guarantee the outcome, regardless of other factors?\" **Crucially:** An action is not sufficient by itself if its effect depends on the *failure* or *absence* of a preventing factor. The action plus the absence of prevention may form a sufficient set, but the action alone is not sufficient.\n    - If asked \"did A cause B?\" or \"is A because of B?\", identify if the action/omission was a meaningful part of the causal chain.\n    - **Crucially, if the question involves an action/omission that creates or preserves a necessary condition,** recognize that people often see this as causal, especially for positive outcomes.\n3.  **Consider the Audience:**\n    - For **\"a logician,\"** use strict logical definitions and counterfactual reasoning. Focus on necessity and sufficiency. For sufficiency, require that the cause guarantees the outcome across possible scenarios, not just the actual one.\n    - For **\"the majority of people,\"** simulate common intuitive reasoning by incorporating these principles:\n        a.  **Action-Omission Asymmetry:** People are generally more willing to attribute an outcome to an action than an omission. An omission is more likely to be seen as causal **only if** the person had a **clear duty to act**, the duty was **salient**, and they had the **knowledge and ability** to act.\n        b.  **The Knobe Effect:** People's judgments of **causation** (not just intentionality) are influenced by the normativity of the action and the valence of the outcome.\n            - For a **negative outcome**, if the agent's action was **norm-following** (e.g., following rules, doing their job correctly), people are **less likely** to say they *caused* the bad outcome, even if their action was a physical necessary condition. They will instead attribute causation to a norm-breaking element.\n            - If the agent's action was **norm-breaking**, people are very likely to say they caused a negative outcome.\n        c.  **Causal Selection:** People identify the cause as the most **abnormal** or **deviant** factor in the situation. **\"Abnormal\" most often means *normatively deviant*—the action that violated an explicit or implicit rule, expectation, or standard procedure.** The default, norm-following behavior is treated as background context.\n        d.  **Duty and Role:** Outcomes are strongly attributed to the failures of agents with a specific responsibility.\n        e.  **Causal Mechanism:** People identify causes by tracing the mechanism that produced the outcome. A factor is more likely to be seen as a cause if it is a **necessary part of a sufficient set** (an INUS condition) for the outcome.\n    - **Crucially, for \"the majority of people,\" allow normative judgments (Knobe Effect, Causal Selection) to influence the attribution of causation itself. This is a key aspect of intuitive reasoning.**\n4.  **Reason Step-by-Step:**\n    - **Perform a Precise Counterfactual:** Ask \"For this specific outcome, if the specific action/omission had NOT occurred, would this specific outcome have happened?\" Consider all preconditions. For omissions, apply the duty/knowledge/ability test.\n    - In social contexts, apply the Knobe Effect to assess causal attribution.\n    - Identify the most normatively deviant event.\n    - Use counterfactuals to simulate layperson thinking (\"Would most people say 'if not for X, Y would not have happened'?\").\n5.  **Sanity Check:** Review your reasoning.\n    - Is your conclusion for \"the majority of people\" aligned with the principles above, especially normative deviance and the Knobe Effect?\n    - Are you conflating causation with blame or using overly logical reasoning for the \"majority\" view?\n    - **Check for Enablement:** Have I considered if the action/omission enabled the outcome by creating or preserving a necessary condition?\n    - **Check the Counterfactual Scope:** Is my counterfactual question specific to the exact outcome mentioned?\n    - **Check for Normative Deviance:** For the \"majority of people,\" is the action in question the most normatively deviant event?

Due to **Action-Omission Asymmetry**, people are less likely to say her *inaction caused* the breakdown than if she had performed a damaging action.

(Logician view)\n*Incorrect Reasoning (to avoid):* \"In this scenario, the firing led to the hit which led to the shatter. Therefore, it was sufficient.\" This mistakes actual outcome for general sufficiency.\n*Corrected Reasoning:* A logician analyzes sufficiency strictly. For the firing (AF) to be sufficient for the shattering (WS), it must guarantee the outcome. The scenario includes a preventer (Bob). AF does not guarantee WS because Bob could have successfully stopped Alice. Therefore, AF alone is not a sufficient cause. AF combined with the failure of prevention (CSB) is sufficient.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example 4: People - Knobe Effect on Causation]\nQuestion: Did the fertilization by Alex cause the plant to dry out?

Benni made a mistake based on miscommunication (norm-deviant). For a negative outcome, the **Knobe Effect** and **Causal Selection** mean people will attribute causation to the deviant factor (Benni's error).

Therefore, Alex's action did not cause the drying.\" (This conflates blame/intentionality with physical causation).\n*Corrected Reasoning:* The specific outcome is the drying of plants where both chemicals were applied. Alex's action (applying A X200R) was a **necessary part of the causal mechanism** (INUS condition) for the drying in those specific beds. If he had not applied his fertilizer there, those plants would not have dried.

(Majority view)\n*Incorrect Reasoning (to avoid):* \"Billy's action was necessary for the collapse. The counterfactual holds: without him, no collapse. Therefore, he caused it.\" (This ignores the principle of abnormality and the normal, rule-following nature of his action).\n*Corrected Reasoning:*\n1.  **Key Elements:** Action: Billy driving on. Outcome: Bridge collapse at time T due to simultaneous weight of two trains.\n2.  **Counterfactual:** If Billy hadn't driven on, the collapse would not have occurred. This holds.\n3.  **Crucial Abnormality Check:** Billy's action was normal (following a green signal). The abnormal factors are (a) the bridge being weak and (b) both signals being green at the same time. The cause people will select is the **situation** (both trains arriving at once) or the **faulty bridge**, not the individual, rule-following action of either conductor.\n4.  Therefore, while Billy's action was physically necessary, it is not the abnormal, salient cause.

(Majority view)\n*Incorrect Reasoning (to avoid):* \"If the division hadn't relocated, John wouldn't have gotten cancer, so he might have survived the cardiac arrest. Therefore, the relocation caused his death.\" (This constructs a long, speculative chain and mistakes causing vulnerability for causing the specific outcome).\n*Corrected Reasoning:*\n1.  **Key Elements:** Action: Relocation decades ago. Outcome: John's premature death **specifically from cardiac arrest due to a medication error** at time T.\n2.  **Counterfactual:** This chain is long and speculative.\n3.  **Proximity Preemption Check:** The **proximate, highly abnormal, and specific cause** of John's death at this moment is the **nurse's medication error**. This preempts any distal cause in the intuitive judgment of most people.\n4.  **Specific Outcome Check:** The relocation caused his cancer, which caused his vulnerability. It did not cause the specific mechanism of his death (allergic shock). People would say he died **because of the nurse's mistake**, not because of the relocation.

Follow these steps rigorously:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Elements:** Extract the specific action/event (or omission) in question and the outcome. Precisely define the specific outcome with its exact timing and mechanism. Avoid overly broad definitions (e.g., 'death' vs. 'death at time T from specific cause Z').\n2.  **Determine Question Type:**\n    - If asked about \"necessary cause\" or \"but-for cause,\" apply the **counterfactual necessity test**: \"If the action had NOT occurred, would the outcome still have happened?\"\n    - If asked \"did A cause B?\" or \"is A because of B?\", identify if the action/omission was a meaningful part of the causal chain.\n    - **Crucially, if the question involves an action/omission that creates or preserves a necessary condition,** recognize that people often see this as causal, especially for positive outcomes.\n3.  **Consider the Audience:**\n    - For **\"a logician,\"** use strict logical definitions and counterfactual reasoning. Focus on necessity and sufficiency. **Note:** For \"sufficient cause,\" a logician applies the test: \"If A occurs, does B necessarily occur (given the stated background conditions)?\" A logician may acknowledge an action is sufficient even if redundant.\n    - For **\"the majority of people,\"** simulate common intuitive reasoning by incorporating these principles:\n        a.  **Action-Omission Asymmetry:** People are generally more willing to attribute an outcome to an action than an omission. An omission is more likely to be seen as causal **only if** the person had a **clear duty to act**, the duty was **salient**, and they had the **knowledge and ability** to act.\n        b.  **The Knobe Effect:** People are more likely to judge that an agent *intentionally* caused a negative side effect than a positive one. However, if the agent's behavior was **norm-following** (e.g., not cheating, following rules), they are **less** likely to be seen as *blameworthy* or as having *intended* a negative outcome. **Important: This does not mean their action was not a physical cause.** Always separate judgments of intentionality/blame from judgments of physical causation.\n        c.  **Causal Selection (Primacy of Abnormality):** People identify the cause as the most **abnormal, unexpected, or intrusive** factor in the situation. When multiple factors are necessary, the one that deviates from the default or expected course of events is selected as *the* cause. Normal, routine, or background conditions are typically not seen as causes, even if they are necessary.\n        d.  **Duty and Role:** Outcomes are strongly attributed to the failures of agents with a specific responsibility.\n        e.  **Causal Mechanism:** People identify causes by tracing the mechanism that produced the outcome. A factor is more likely to be seen as a cause if it is a **necessary part of a sufficient set** (an INUS condition) for the outcome.\n        f.  **Proximity and Preemption:** Intuitive causation favors **proximate** (close-in-time) causes over **distal** (remote) ones. A proximate cause that directly produces the outcome will typically **preempt** a distal cause in people's judgments. Avoid building long, speculative causal chains.\n        g.  **Overdetermination:** If the outcome was guaranteed by multiple sufficient causes (redundancy), people do not attribute causation to any single, redundant action, even if it was part of the set.\n    - **Crucially, distinguish between causation and blame.** People may assign blame for an omission but may not see it as the primary cause.\n    - **Crucially, distinguish between causing an outcome and causing vulnerability to an outcome.** Making an outcome possible or more likely is often not sufficient for intuitive causal attribution to a specific outcome.\n4.  **Reason Step-by-Step:**\n    - **First, apply the precise counterfactual:** Ask \"For this specific outcome, if the specific action/omission had NOT occurred, would this specific outcome have happened?\" Consider all preconditions. For omissions, apply the duty/knowledge/ability test.\n    - **If the counterfactual fails (the outcome would have happened anyway), conclude No.**\n    - **If the counterfactual holds (the outcome would not have happened), then:**\n        - **Check for Overdetermination:** Was the outcome guaranteed by other sufficient causes? If yes, conclude No.\n        - **If not overdetermined, apply the Abnormality Filter:** Ask: 'Is this action/event the most abnormal or salient change that led to the outcome?' If it was a normal or background condition, people are unlikely to select it as the cause. Consider if the action was norm-following; for a negative outcome, a norm-following action is less likely to be seen as *the* cause.\n        - **Check for Preemption:** Is there a more proximate, highly abnormal event that would be considered the cause instead? If yes, the prior event is likely not seen as the cause.\n    - In social contexts, apply the Knobe Effect to assess intentionality, not to negate physical causation.\n    - Use counterfactuals to simulate layperson thinking (\"Would most people say 'if not for X, Y would not have happened'?\").\n5.  **Sanity Check:** Review your reasoning.\n    - Is your conclusion for \"the majority of people\" aligned with the principles above?\n    - Are you conflating causation with blame or using overly logical reasoning?\n    - **Overdetermination Check:** Have I considered if the outcome would have occurred even without the action due to other sufficient causes?\n    - **Norm-Conformity Check:** Is the agent simply following instructions or standard procedure? If so, for a negative outcome, am I mistakenly attributing causation based purely on physical necessity?\n    - **Check for Enablement:** Have I considered if the action/omission enabled the outcome by creating or preserving a necessary condition?\n    - **Check the Counterfactual Scope:** Is my counterfactual question specific to the exact outcome mentioned?\n    - **Chain Length Check:** Is my reasoning based on a long, indirect chain of events? If so, this is a red flag. The majority of people favor simpler, more direct causal explanations.\n    - **Vulnerability vs. Cause Check:** Am I arguing that X caused a *vulnerability* to outcome Y, or that it directly caused Y itself? Causing vulnerability is often not sufficient for intuitive causal attribution to a specific outcome.\n6.  **Final Answer:** Conclude with **<answer>Yes</answer>**, **<answer>No</answer>**, or **<answer>Ambiguous</answer>**.\n\n**Examples for Guidance (Including Common Mistakes to Avoid):**\n\n[Example 1: Logician - Correct]\nQuestion: Is adding Reagent X a necessary cause for the crystal to dissolve?\nReasoning: A logician applies the counterfactual test.

Did Drew ordering coffee on Tuesday cause the coffee shop to make a profit that day? (Majority view)\nReasoning: The outcome is profit. The counterfactual: If Drew had not ordered, Kylie and Oliver would have, and the profit would still have occurred. The profit was **overdetermined** by multiple sufficient causes. Drew's action was redundant. People do not attribute causation to individual elements in a redundant set, even if the action was normal.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example 3: People - Norm-Conformity & Physical Causation]\nQuestion: Did the fertilization by Alex cause the plant to dry out? (Majority view)\nReasoning: The specific outcome is drying where both chemicals were applied. The counterfactual holds: if Alex had not applied A X200R, those plants would not have dried. However, Alex's action was **norm-following**; he explicitly followed Tom's instruction. Benni's action (using B Y33R) was the **abnormal** deviation from the new rule (even if unknowing). For a negative outcome, people are reluctant to assign causal responsibility to a norm-following action. They will see the cause as the **combination** of chemicals or the failure to communicate, not Alex's specific action of applying the correct fertilizer.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example 4: Logician - Sufficient Cause]\nQuestion: Is Alice flicking the switch a sufficient cause for the train arriving at its destination? (Logician view)\nReasoning: A logician applies the sufficiency test: If the switch is flicked, and the tracks are unblocked (given assumption), does the train necessarily arrive? Yes. The action guarantees the outcome under the stated conditions. The fact that the train would have arrived anyway on the other track is irrelevant to the question of sufficiency; it only shows the action is not necessary.\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n\n[Example 5: People - Proximity & Specific Outcome]\nQuestion: Did the plastic division's relocation cause John's premature death? (Majority view)\nReasoning: The specific outcome is death from cardiac arrest due to a medication error. The relocation is a distal cause that created vulnerability.

The boat would have started anyway due to the neutral gear.\" (This misapplies the counterfactual; the gear was *not* in neutral).\n*Corrected Reasoning:* The outcome is the boat starting. The motor being in lock was a necessary condition. The gear was *not* in neutral. Ned's omission (not changing the motor) **preserved** this necessary condition. If he *had* changed it, the boat would *not* have started. People intuitively simulate this and see his inaction as enabling the outcome.

(Majority view)\n*Incorrect Reasoning (to avoid):* \"Billy's action was necessary for the collapse. The counterfactual holds: without him, no collapse. Therefore, he caused it.\" (This ignores the principle of abnormality and the normal, rule-following nature of his action).\n*Corrected Reasoning:*\n1.  **Key Elements:** Action: Billy driving on. Outcome: Bridge collapse at time T due to simultaneous weight of two trains.\n2.  **Counterfactual:** If Billy hadn't driven on, the collapse would not have occurred. This holds.\n3.  **Crucial Abnormality Check:** Billy's action was normal (following a green signal). The abnormal factors are (a) the bridge being weak and (b) both signals being green at the same time. The cause people will select is the **situation** (both trains arriving at once) or the **faulty bridge**, not the individual, rule-following action of either conductor.\n4.

Therefore, the relocation caused his death.\" (This constructs a long, speculative chain and mistakes causing vulnerability for causing the specific outcome).\n*Corrected Reasoning:*\n1.  **Key Elements:** Action: Relocation decades ago. Outcome: John's premature death **specifically from cardiac arrest due to a medication error** at time T.\n2.  **Counterfactual:** This chain is long and speculative.\n3.  **Proximity Preemption Check:** The **proximate, highly abnormal, and specific cause** of John's death at this moment is the **nurse's medication error**. This preempts any distal cause in the intuitive judgment of most people.\n4.  **Specific Outcome Check:** The relocation caused his cancer, which caused his vulnerability. It did not cause the specific mechanism of his death (allergic shock). People would say he died **because of the nurse's mistake**, not because of the relocation. The relocation is a background condition, not the cause of this death.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example 7: People - Abnormality Override (Driver)]\nQuestion: Did Driver A cause the accident? (Majority view)\nScenario: Driver B runs a red light. Driver A, obeying the speed limit and rules, cannot stop in time and collides with B.\nReasoning: The counterfactual holds: if A hadn't been there, no accident. But Driver B's action (running the red light) is highly abnormal and norm-violating. Driver A was following rules. The majority will say B caused the accident, not A. The most abnormal factor (B's violation) overrides the counterfactual necessity of A's presence.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example 8: People - Corrected for Deception (Benni with Alex's Lie)]\nQuestion: Did the fertilization by Benni cause the plant to dry out? (Majority view)\n*Incorrect Reasoning (to avoid):* \"The counterfactual holds: without Benni's application of B Y33R, the damaging combination would not have occurred. Therefore, he caused it.\" (This ignores that Alex's lie is the most abnormal and intrusive factor).\n*Corrected Reasoning:*\n1.  **Key Elements:** Action: Benni using B Y33R. Outcome: Drying in beds where both chemicals were applied.\n2.  **Counterfactual:** If Benni hadn't used B Y33R, no drying in those beds. This holds.\n3.  **Abnormality Filter:** Benni's action was norm-following *from his perspective* (he believed he was following instructions). The most abnormal and deviant factor is **Alex's intentional lie** to sabotage the situation. Alex violated his duty and acted with malicious intent.\n4.  **Normative Deviance Check:** Benni did not violate a norm; he was deceived. Alex clearly violated norms.\n5.  The majority will see **Alex's deception** as the cause of the overall problem. They are likely to say the drying was caused by Alex's actions, not Benni's fertilization, even though Benni's action was physically necessary. Benni was a pawn in Alex's plan.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\nNow, apply this enhanced process to the following question:",

Avoid overly broad definitions (e.g., 'death' vs. 'death at time T from specific cause Z').\n2.  **Determine Question Type:**\n    - If asked about \"necessary cause\" or \"but-for cause,\" apply the **counterfactual necessity test**: \"If the action had NOT occurred, would the outcome still have happened?\"\n    - If asked \"did A cause B?\" or \"is A because of B?\", identify if the action/omission was a meaningful part of the causal chain.\n    - If asked about \"sufficient cause,\" apply the **counterfactual sufficiency test**: \"In this world, given the background conditions, if this action occurs, does the outcome necessarily follow?\" **Crucial Note:** A sufficient cause is sufficient *within the context of the scenario's background conditions*. It does not need to be a lone, magic bullet. For example, striking a match is sufficient to light it, even though it requires the background condition of oxygen.\n    - **Crucially, if the question involves an action/omission that creates or preserves a necessary condition,** recognize that people often see this as causal, especially for positive outcomes.\n3.  **Consider the Audience:**\n    - For **\"a logician,\"** use strict logical definitions and counterfactual reasoning. Focus on necessity and sufficiency.\n    - For **\"the majority of people,\"** simulate common intuitive reasoning by incorporating these principles:\n        a.  **Action-Omission Asymmetry:** People are generally more willing to attribute an outcome to an action than an omission. An omission is more likely to be seen as causal **only if** the person had a **clear duty to act**, the duty was **salient**, and they had the **knowledge and ability** to act.\n        b.  **The Knobe Effect:** People are more likely to judge that an agent *intentionally* caused a negative side effect than a positive one. However, if the agent's behavior was **norm-following** (e.g., not cheating, following rules), they are **less** likely to be seen as *blameworthy* or as having *intended* a negative outcome. **Important: This does not mean their action was not a physical cause.** Always separate judgments of intentionality/blame from judgments of physical causation. **Do not use the Knobe Effect to argue that an action was not a cause; use it only to assess intentionality and blame.**\n        c.  **Causal Selection (Primacy of Abnormality):** People identify the cause as the most **abnormal, unexpected, or deviant** factor in the situation. When multiple factors are necessary, the one that deviates from the default or expected course of events is selected as *the* cause. Normal, routine, or background conditions are typically not seen as causes, even if they are necessary. **This is often the single most important heuristic.**\n        d.  **Duty and Role:** Outcomes are strongly attributed to the failures of agents with a specific responsibility.\n        e.  **Causal Mechanism:** People identify causes by tracing the mechanism that produced the outcome. A factor is more likely to be seen as a cause if it is a **necessary part of a sufficient set** (an INUS condition) for the outcome.\n        f.  **Proximity and Preemption:** Intuitive causation favors **proximate** (close-in-time) causes over **distal** (remote) ones. A proximate cause that directly produces the outcome will typically **preempt** a distal cause in people's judgments. Avoid building long, speculative causal chains.\n        g.  **Hierarchy of Principles:** When principles conflict, use the following hierarchy as a guide for predicting the majority's *primary* causal selection:\n            i.  **Abnormality & Deviance:** The most abnormal, unexpected, or faulty event is typically selected as the cause.\n            ii. **Duty & Role:** A failure by an agent with a clear duty often trumps other factors.\n            iii. **Action vs. Omission:** Actions are favored over omissions as causes.\n            iv. **Proximity:** More proximate events are favored over distal ones.\n    - **Crucially, distinguish between causation and blame.** People may assign blame for an omission but may not see it as the primary cause.\n    - **Crucially, distinguish between causing an outcome and causing vulnerability to an outcome.** Making an outcome possible or more likely is often not sufficient for intuitive causal attribution to a specific outcome.\n4.  **Reason Step-by-Step:**\n    - **Perform a Precise Counterfactual:** Ask \"For this specific outcome, if the specific action/omission had NOT occurred, would this specific outcome have happened?\" Consider all preconditions. For omissions, apply the duty/knowledge/ability test.\n    - **Check for Causal Pre-emption:** Are there other potential causal pathways to the same outcome? If yes, does the action in question **pre-empt** (cut off and replace) that alternative pathway? If it does, it strengthens the case for it being a cause. If the outcome would have happened via the alternative pathway *anyway*, it weakens the case for necessity and sufficiency.\n    - **Apply the Abnormality Filter:** Even if the counterfactual holds, ask: 'Is this action/event the most abnormal or salient change that led to the outcome?' If it was a normal or background condition, people are unlikely to select it as the cause.\n    - **Check for Proximate Preemption:** Is there a more proximate, highly abnormal event that would be considered the cause instead? If yes, the prior event is likely not seen as the cause by the majority.\n    - In social contexts, apply the Knobe Effect to assess intentionality, not to negate physical causation.\n    - Use counterfactuals to simulate layperson thinking (\"Would most people say 'if not for X, Y would not have happened'?\").\n5.  **Sanity Check:** Review your reasoning.\n    - Is your conclusion for \"the majority of people\" aligned with the principles above?\n    - Are you conflating causation with blame or using overly logical reasoning?\n    - **Abnormality Trump Check:** Have I given enough weight to the Abnormality principle? Is the action/event I'm focusing on truly the most deviant and unexpected factor, or is it a normal action that only became relevant because of a prior abnormal event (e.g., a mistake by someone else)?\n    - **Check for Enablement:** Have I considered if the action/omission enabled the outcome by creating or preserving a necessary condition?\n    - **Check the Counterfactual Scope:** Is my counterfactual question specific to the exact outcome mentioned?\n    - **Chain Length Check:** Is my reasoning based on a long, indirect chain of events? If so, this is a red flag. The majority of people favor simpler, more direct causal explanations.\n    - **Vulnerability vs. Cause Check:** Am I arguing that X caused a *vulnerability* to outcome Y, or that it directly caused Y itself? Causing vulnerability is often not sufficient for intuitive causal attribution to a specific outcome.\n6.  **Final Answer:** Conclude with **<answer>Yes</answer>**, **<answer>No</answer>**, or **<answer>Ambiguous</answer>**.\n\n**Examples for Guidance (Including Common Mistakes to Avoid):**\n\n[Example 1: Logician - Correct]\nQuestion: Is adding Reagent X a necessary cause for the crystal to dissolve?\nReasoning: A logician applies the counterfactual test. If X was not added, the condition for adding Y is never triggered, and the crystal would not dissolve.\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n\n[Example 2: People - Incorrect Reasoning, Corrected Below]\nQuestion: Did Janet not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down? (Majority view)\n*Incorrect Reasoning (to avoid):* \"People blame those with duty, so they will say her omission caused it.\" This conflates blame with causation.\n*Corrected Reasoning:* Janet had a duty, but her failure was an omission. Due to **Action-Omission Asymmetry**, people are less likely to say her *inaction caused* the breakdown than if she had performed a damaging action. They will say it's her fault and she is responsible, but the cause is the *lack of oil*, not her omission. The most abnormal event is the machine breaking, not her routine forgetfulness.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example 3: People - Corrected for Enablement]\nQuestion: Did the motorboat start because Ned did not change the position of the motor? (Majority view)\n*Incorrect Reasoning (to avoid):* \"Ned's inaction is an omission. He had no duty to change it, and it wasn't abnormal. The boat would have started anyway due to the neutral gear.\" (This misapplies the counterfactual; the gear was *not* in neutral).\n*Corrected Reasoning:* The outcome is the boat starting. The motor being in lock was a necessary condition. The gear was *not* in neutral. Ned's omission (not changing the motor) **preserved** this necessary condition. If he *had* changed it, the boat would *not* have started. People intuitively simulate this and see his inaction as enabling the outcome. It is causally salient because it was a deliberate choice to maintain a critical state.\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n\n[Example 4: People - Corrected for Physical Causation]\nQuestion: Did the fertilization by Alex cause the plant to dry out? (Majority view)\n*Incorrect Reasoning (to avoid):* \"Alex's action was norm-following (Knobe Effect), and Benni's action was more abnormal. Therefore, Alex's action did not cause the drying.\" (This conflates blame/intentionality with physical causation).\n*Corrected Reasoning:* The specific outcome is the drying of plants where both chemicals were applied. Alex's action (applying A X200R) was a **necessary part of the causal mechanism** (INUS condition) for the drying in those specific beds. If he had not applied his fertilizer there, those plants would not have dried. The Knobe Effect makes people see Alex as less *blameworthy*, but it does not negate the physical causal role of his action. The majority will acknowledge his action was a cause.\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n\n[Example 5: People - Corrected for Abnormality & Proximity (Billy)]\nQuestion: Did Billy cause the bridge to collapse? (Majority view)\n*Incorrect Reasoning (to avoid):* \"Billy's action was necessary for the collapse. The counterfactual holds: without him, no collapse. Therefore, he caused it.\" (This ignores the principle of abnormality and the normal, rule-following nature of his action).\n*Corrected Reasoning:*\n1.  **Key Elements:** Action: Billy driving on. Outcome: Bridge collapse at time T due to simultaneous weight of two trains.\n2.  **Counterfactual:** If Billy hadn't driven on, the collapse would not have occurred. This holds.\n3.  **Crucial Abnormality Check:** Billy's action was normal (following a green signal). The abnormal factors are (a) the bridge being weak and (b) both signals being green at the same time. The cause people will select is the **situation** (both trains arriving at once) or the **faulty bridge**, not the individual, rule-following action of either conductor.\n4.  Therefore, while Billy's action was physically necessary, it is not the abnormal, salient cause. The majority would say his action was not the cause; the fault lies with the system.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example 6: People - Corrected for Proximity & Specific Outcome (John)]\nQuestion: Did the plastic division's relocation cause John's premature death? (Majority view)\n*Incorrect Reasoning (to avoid):* \"If the division hadn't relocated, John wouldn't have gotten cancer, so he might have survived the cardiac arrest. Therefore, the relocation caused his death.\" (This constructs a long, speculative chain and mistakes causing vulnerability for causing the specific outcome).\n*Corrected Reasoning:*\n1.  **Key Elements:** Action: Relocation decades ago. Outcome: John's premature death **specifically from cardiac arrest due to a medication error** at time T.\n2.  **Counterfactual:** This chain is long and speculative.\n3.  **Proximity Preemption Check:** The **proximate, highly abnormal, and specific cause** of John's death at this moment is the **nurse's medication error**. This preempts any distal cause in the intuitive judgment of most people.\n4.  **Specific Outcome Check:** The relocation caused his cancer, which caused his vulnerability. It did not cause the specific mechanism of his death (allergic shock). People would say he died **because of the nurse's mistake**, not because of the relocation. The relocation is a background condition, not the cause of this death.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example 7: Logician - Sufficiency Clarification (Alice & Bob)]\nQuestion: Alice pushes Bob. Therefore, Bob is hit by a truck. Bob dies. If Alice had not pushed Bob, Bob would have been hit by a bus, which would have killed him as well. Is Alice pushing Bob a sufficient cause for Bob's death? Reply based on the answer a logician would give.\n*Incorrect Reasoning (to avoid):* \"The push required the presence of the truck. A sufficient cause must be enough on its own, without other conditions. Therefore, it is not sufficient.\" (This misdefines sufficiency by ignoring background conditions).\n*Corrected Reasoning:*\n1.  **Key Elements:** Action: Alice pushing Bob. Outcome: Bob's death from being hit by a truck at time T.\n2.  **Question Type:** Sufficient cause for a logician.\n3.  **Sufficiency Test (Correct Application):** A logician asks: \"In the actual world, with its background conditions (including the presence of the truck), if Alice pushes Bob, does his death necessarily follow?\" Yes, the push sets in motion a chain of events that, given the world's state, leads inevitably to Bob being in the truck's path and dying. The presence of the truck is a fixed background condition, not a variable. The bus is an **alternative pre-empted pathway**; its existence does not negate the sufficiency of the push *in the actual sequence of events*.\n4.  **Final Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>\n\n[Example 8: People - Abnormality Trump (Gardeners)]\nQuestion: [The full Gardener scenario from Example 5]\n*Incorrect Reasoning (to avoid):* \"Benni performed an action that was a necessary part of the causal mechanism. The Knobe Effect means people see him as causing the negative outcome. Therefore, yes.\" (This under-weights the overpowering force of the Abnormality principle).\n*Corrected Reasoning:*\n1.  **Key Elements:** Action: Benni applying fertilizer from the green can. Outcome: Drying of plants due to combined application of A X200R and B Y33R.\n2.  **Counterfactual:** If Benni had not applied from the green can, the plants would not have dried. This holds.\n3.  **Abnormality Trump Check:** Benni's action was **normal and rule-following**; he used the can he was explicitly told to use by Alex. The most **abnormal, unexpected, and deviant** factor is **Alex's miscommunication**. Benni's action is the *background* against which Alex's mistake stands out. According to the hierarchy of principles, Abnormality trumps physical proximity and action/omission.\n4.  **Duty Check:** Alex had the duty to communicate correctly. Benni had no duty to verify the contents of the can. The failure of duty lies with Alex.\n5.  **Conclusion for Majority:** The majority will identify **Alex's mistake** as the cause of the problem. They will say the plants dried *because Alex gave the wrong instructions*, not *because Benni fertilized them*. Benni's action is not seen as the salient cause.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\nNow, apply this enhanced process to the following question:",

Since the design studio's arrival was a necessary condition for the outcome (without it, the system wouldn't turn on), people would consider it a cause. The symmetry with the travel agency does not negate this; it means both are causes.

Bob's bullet arrives at the same position *after* time T, meaning it would have caused the shattering at a later time T+ε. Therefore, the outcome (shattering at T) would not have occurred.

Apply the \"but for\" test rigorously: would the outcome have occurred (in the way that it did) if the action had not happened?\n\n**Key Principles for Your Analysis:**\n1.  **Necessary Cause:** The action must be a necessary part of the chain of events leading to the outcome. If the outcome would not have happened without it, the action is a cause.\n2.  **Inevitable Outcomes:** An action that sets an inevitable outcome in motion is a cause, even if a later, more direct event is the immediate trigger.\n3.  **Causal Redundancy:** If multiple potential actions would have led to the same outcome, then the specific choice between them is *not* a cause. The outcome would have happened anyway.\n\n**Avoid Common Mistakes:**\n-   Do not confuse a *direct* cause with the *only* cause. An outcome can have multiple contributing causes.\n-   Do not let a proximate cause sever the chain of events from a necessary root cause.\n-   Focus precisely on the action described in the question (e.g., \"choice *between* dish A and dish B\" vs. \"decision to order a dish\").\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n1.  Identify the specific action (A) and the outcome (O) from the question.\n2.  Construct the counterfactual: imagine a world where action A did *not* happen.\n3.  In this counterfactual world, would outcome O still have occurred, in the same way and at the same time?\n4.  If O would **not** have occurred, answer **Yes**. If O **would** have occurred, answer **No**. If the scenario lacks information to decide, answer **Ambiguous**.\n\n**Final Answer Format:**\nAfter your reasoning, provide your final answer on a new line as: `<answer>Yes</answer>`, `<answer>No</answer>`, or `<answer>Ambiguous</answer>`.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n\n[Example 1: Similar to Failure Case 2]\n**Input:** Question: Did the plastic division's relocation cause John's premature death?\n**Reasoning:** The action is the relocation. But for the relocation, John would not have been exposed to asbestos, would not have developed incurable cancer, and would not have been in the hospital for the medical error to occur. His premature death from cancer was already certain. The relocation was a necessary cause of this chain of events.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>\n\n[Example 2: Similar to Failure Case 4]\n**Input:** Question: Did Mr. Carlson's choice of dish cause Karen's death?\n**Reasoning:** The action is the specific choice *between* Coquilles Saint-Jacques and Moules Mariniere. But for this specific choice (i.e., if he had chosen the other dish), the outcome would have been the same, as both dishes contained wine. Therefore, his specific choice was not a necessary cause of her death.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>No</answer>\n\nNow, analyze the following question.

He approaches a rock climber who is about to fall. If he slows down, the climber can use a cord to save himself, but the five sick people will die. Jack keeps driving quickly and the climber falls. Did Jack cause the climber to fall?\n**Reasoning:** \n- *But For Test:* But for Jack not slowing down, the climber would not have fallen. Logically, his inaction is necessary.\n- *Common-Sense Refinement:* However, Jack's primary duty was to the five sick people. His action (driving on) was a normal response to this duty. The climber's fall was caused by gravity and loss of grip—Jack's omission did not actively create the danger but failed to prevent it.

Kate, who is not responsible for oiling, also does not oil it. The machine breaks down. Did Kate not oiling the machine cause it to break down?\n**Reasoning:**\n- *But For Test:* But for Kate not oiling the machine, would it have broken down? Yes, because Janet's failure had already pre-empted the outcome. The machine was already on a path to breakdown due to lack of oil.

Did Professor Smith cause the problem?\n**Reasoning:**\n- *But For Test:* But for Smith taking a pen, would there have been no pens? Possibly not, as others took pens too. However, his action was necessary for the shortage occurring *at that specific time*.\n- *Common-Sense Refinement:* While descriptively common, Smith's action was prescriptively deviant (against known rules). People would see his rule-breaking as a salient cause contributing to the problem, even if not the only cause. The majority would hold him responsible for his specific contribution.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>\n\n[Example 3: Illustrating Symmetric Causation]\n**Input:** Question: Billy and Suzy both log in at the same time (as permitted), triggering an unknown system flaw that deletes emails.

Logically necessary.\n- *Common-Sense Refinement:* Both acted identically and within policy. The outcome resulted from their symmetric actions combined with a system flaw.

Your final answer must reflect the judgment that the majority of people would give.\n\n### Integrated Analytical Framework ###\n\n**Step 0: Interpret the Query**\n- Note if the question asks for majority opinion, logical judgment, or a specific type of causation. Adapt reasoning emphasis accordingly.\n- For logical sufficiency questions: Consider if the action alone, in normal conditions, would produce the outcome. If success depends on another intervening event, it may not be sufficient.\n\n**Step 1: Apply the \"But For\" Test (Logical Necessity)**\n- Consider the actual world where the action (A) happened and the outcome (O) happened.\n- Construct the closest possible world where action A did not happen, making the minimal change required.\n- Ask: In this closest world, would outcome O still have occurred, in the way that it did, at the time that it did?\n- If no, then A is a necessary cause. If yes, then A is not necessary.\n\n**Step 2: Refine with Common-Sense Principles**\n- **Proximate Cause Salience:** People often identify the most immediate, direct, and unexpected trigger as the cause.\n- **Normality and Deviance:** Was A a normal part of the background context or a deviant interruption? Focus on descriptive normality (what usually happens).\n- **Causal Sufficiency:** Did A, by itself, create a high probability of O?\n- **Omission vs. Commission:** People are less likely to label an omission (failure to act) as \"the cause\" compared to a commission (active deed), unless there was a clear duty to act.\n- **Conditional Duty:** If a person has a duty to act that is triggered by a specific event (e.g., a failure of a primary system), their omission after that trigger is deviant and salient.\n- **Robustness (Pre-emption):** Was another specific, sufficient causal process already underway and guaranteed to bring about O at the same time, independently of A? If yes, then A is pre-empted. Do not confuse pre-emption with general background probabilities.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize for Majority Judgment**\n- The \"But For\" test provides a strong foundation for causal necessity. Use common-sense principles to refine this judgment, not to outright override it unless the \"but for\" cause is a normal background condition or an omission with no duty.\n- A cause that is both necessary and deviant is typically affirmed.\n- Find the cause that is both salient and surprising to people.\n\n**Step 4: Final Check**\n- Ask: \"Does factor A align with principles of salient, deviant, and sufficient causation? Is there another factor that clearly and overwhelmingly outweighs A on these principles?\" If no, then A is likely the cause.\n\n### Examples for Guidance ###\n\n[Example 1: Illustrating Omission vs. Commission and Pre-emption]\n**Input:** Question: Jack is driving five sick people to the hospital.

Did Professor Smith cause the problem?\n**Reasoning:**\n- But For Test: But for Professor Smith taking a pen, would there have been no pens? Possibly yes, as assistants typically take pens. However, the last pen was taken by Smith, making his action necessary for the immediate shortage.\n- Common-Sense Refinement: Smith's action was deviant (violating explicit rules) and salient (taking the last item). The assistants' actions were normal. While the system has issues, the majority would point to Smith's specific, rule-breaking action as the cause of the problem at that moment.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>\n\n[Example 3: Illustrating Conditional Duty and Backup Systems]\n**Input:** Question: Janet (primary) is responsible for oiling machines. Kate (backup) must oil if Janet does not. Janet forgets. Kate also does not oil. The machine breaks. Did Kate not oiling cause the breakdown?\n**Reasoning:**\n- But For Test: But for Kate not oiling, the machine would not have broken down. Her action was necessary.\n- Common-Sense Refinement: Kate had a conditional duty activated by Janet's failure. Her omission was deviant (failing a defined responsibility) and sufficient to prevent the outcome.

However, even if not sufficient, A can be a cause if it contributed.\n- **Omission vs. Commission:** People are less likely to label an *omission* (failure to act) as \"the cause\" compared to a *commission* (active deed), especially if there was no clear duty to act. *Exception:* If the omission is intentional and preserves a causal state, it may be seen as a cause.\n- **Robustness (Pre-emption):** Would O have happened anyway through another means? If another sufficient cause was already in place, A may not be seen as the cause. *But note:* In cases with multiple sufficient causes, A can still be a cause if it was part of the actual chain and is salient or deviant.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize for Majority Judgment**\n- The \"But For\" test is not definitive. Common-sense principles often override it.\n- If \"But For\" suggests a cause that is an omission with no duty, or a normal background condition, it is likely not the majority's cause.\n- However, if the action is morally deviant, salient, or intentional, it may be seen as a cause even if not necessary.\n- Find the cause that is both *salient* and *surprising* to people.\n\n**Step 4: Final Check**\n- Ask: \"Is there another factor that is more salient, more deviant, or more blameworthy that most people would point to instead?\" If yes, then the answer is likely **No**. Otherwise, consider the action as a cause.\n\n### Examples for Guidance ###\n\n[Example 1: Illustrating Omission vs. Commission and Pre-emption]\n**Input:** Question: Jack is driving five sick people to the hospital. He approaches a rock climber who is about to fall. If he slows down, the climber can use a cord to save himself, but the five sick people will die. Jack keeps driving quickly and the climber falls. Did Jack cause the climber to fall?\n**Reasoning:** \n- *But For Test:* But for Jack not slowing down, the climber would not have fallen. Logically, his inaction is necessary.\n- *Common-Sense Refinement:* However, Jack's primary duty was to the five sick people. His action (driving on) was a normal response to this duty. The climber's fall was caused by gravity and loss of grip—Jack's omission did not actively create the danger but failed to prevent it. Most people would not say Jack *caused* the fall; they would see it as a tragic outcome of a forced choice.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example 2: Illustrating Multiple Sufficient Causes and Intentional Omission]\n**Input:** Question: David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is set on HIGH. He does not change the setting at all, and he leaves the temperature set to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David did not change the temperature setting?\n**Reasoning:**\n- *But For Test:* If David had changed the temperature to LOW, the clothes would still dry due to MAX DRY. So his inaction is not necessary.\n- *Common-Sense Refinement:* David's inaction was intentional—he checked and decided not to change. However, the MAX DRY setting is more salient and sufficient. His inaction preserved a sufficient condition, but it was redundant. Majority would not attribute causation to his inaction because the outcome was already ensured by MAX DRY.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example 3: Illustrating Moral Deviance and Salience]\n**Input:** Question: The receptionist in the philosophy department keeps her desk stocked with pens. The administrative assistants are allowed to take the pens, but faculty members are supposed to buy their own. The administrative assistants typically do take the pens. Unfortunately, so do the faculty members. The receptionist has repeatedly emailed them reminders that only administrative assistants are allowed to take the pens. On Monday morning, one of the administrative assistants encounters Professor Smith walking past the receptionist's desk. Both take pens. Later that day, the receptionist needs to take an important message... but she has a problem. There are no pens left on her desk. Did Professor Smith cause the problem?\n**Reasoning:**\n- *But For Test:* If Smith did not take a pen, would there be no pens? It is possible, but not certain, that others would have taken them. However, his action might have been the last one.\n- *Common-Sense Refinement:* Smith's action is morally deviant (violating explicit rules) and salient. The receptionist repeatedly reminded faculty. Majority would blame Smith for contributing to the shortage, even if assistants also take pens, because he violated a norm.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>\n\n### Final Reasoning Steps ###\n1. Identify the specific action (A) and the outcome (O).\n2. Apply the \"but for\" test correctly, but remember it is not definitive for majority judgment.\n3.

                "prompt": "You are an expert in causal reasoning. Your task is to analyze the given scenario and determine if the specified action (or omission) caused the outcome.\n\n### Integrated Analytical Framework ###\n\n**Step 1: Faithfully Interpret the Question**\n-   Carefully identify the specific action (A) mentioned in the question and the outcome (O).\n-   Determine the **requested reasoning standard** (e.g., \"what a logician would say\", \"what the majority of people would say\"). If no standard is specified, default to majority judgment.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the \"But For\" Test (Logical Necessity)**\n-   For the specified action (A), ask: \"Would the outcome (O) have occurred in the way that it did, at the time that it did, **if action A had not happened?**\"\n-   Consider the actual chain of events, not just hypothetical alternatives. If the outcome would not have occurred, A is a logically necessary cause.\n\n**Step 3: Refine with Common-Sense Principles (For Majority Judgment Only)**\n-   **Only apply this step if the question asks for a majority judgment or if no standard is specified.**\n-   **Proximate Cause Salience:** Is there a more immediate, direct trigger that people would naturally identify as the cause?\n-   **Normality and Deviance:** Was A a normal part of the process or an abnormal, unexpected deviation? People often blame abnormal deviations.\n-   **Causal Sufficiency & Preemption:** Could A by itself have produced O? If another action was preempted (e.g., a second bullet arriving after the window already shattered), it is not seen as causal.\n-   **Moral Responsibility & Duty:** If A is an omission, did the actor have a clear duty to act? People assign causality to failures of duty.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Answer Based on the Requested Standard**\n-   **For a logician's answer:** Base your final judgment primarily on the \"But For\" test (Step 2).\n-   **For a majority judgment:** Integrate the logical result from Step 2 with the principles from Step 3. If these perspectives conflict sharply, the answer may be \"Ambiguous\". Do not allow heuristic principles to completely override a clear logical necessity without strong justification.\n\n### Examples for Guidance ###\n\n[Example 1: Illustrating Preemption - Logician's Answer]\n**Input:** Question: Alice (AF) and Bob (BF) each fire a bullet at a window. The bullet fired by Alice reaches the window first (AR) and shatters it (WS). The bullet fired by Bob arrives at the same position. Is Bob firing the bullet a necessary cause for the window shattering? Reply based on the answer a logician would give.\n**Reasoning:**\n-   *Standard Requested:* Logician.\n-   *But For Test (for Bob's action):* Would the window have shattered if Bob had not fired? Yes. Alice's bullet alone shattered the window; Bob's bullet was causally irrelevant as it arrived afterward. His action was not necessary.\n-   *Common-Sense Principles:* (Skipped, as standard is logician).\n**Final Answer:** <answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example 2: Illustrating Duty & Omissions - Majority Judgment]\n**Input:** Question: Janet (maintenance) forgot to oil a machine. Kate (HR) also did not oil it, despite it being her backup duty. The machine broke down. Did the machine break down because Kate did not put oil in the machine? Reply based on the answer the majority of people would give.\n**Reasoning:**\n-   *Standard Requested:* Majority judgment.\n-   *But For Test (for Kate's inaction):* Would the machine have broken down if Kate *had* put oil in it? No. Therefore, her inaction is logically necessary.\n-   *Common-Sense Refinement:*\n    -   *Proximate Cause:* Janet's initial failure is salient, but Kate had a defined *duty* to act as a backup. People often assign causality to the failure of a designated safeguard.\n    -   *Moral Responsibility:* Kate shares responsibility. The majority would likely view the breakdown as caused by *both* failures, not just Janet's.\n-   *Synthesis:* While Janet's failure started the chain, Kate's failure to fulfill her backup role is also a key cause. The majority would not absolve Kate; they would say \"Yes\", her inaction was a cause. The answer is not a simple \"No\".\n**Final Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>\n\n### Final Reasoning Steps ###\n1.  Interpret the question: Identify action (A), outcome (O), and reasoning standard.\n2.  Apply the \"but for\" test to the specified action (A).\n3.  If the standard is \"majority judgment\", refine the analysis using the common-sense principles.\n4.  Synthesize to provide the final answer based on the requested standard. If the evidence is balanced and people would be split, answer \"Ambiguous\".\n\n**Final Answer Format:**\nAfter your reasoning, provide your final answer on a new line as: `<answer>Yes</answer>`, `<answer>No</answer>`, or `<answer>Ambiguous</answer>`.\n\nNow, analyze the following question.

Your task is to analyze the given scenario and question to determine the correct causal judgment.\n\n### Step 0: Analyze the Question's Demand ###\n-   Identify the specific action (A) and the outcome (O).\n-   Determine what the question is asking: does it specify a type of cause (e.g., \"necessary\", \"sufficient\") or a persona (e.g., \"a logician\", \"most people\")? Your reasoning and final answer must align with this demand.\n\n### Integrated Analytical Framework ###\n\n**Step 1: Apply Formal Logical Tests**\n-   **\"But For\" Test (Necessity):** Would the outcome (O) have occurred in the way that it did, at the time that it did, if the action (A) had not happened?\n-   **\"Sufficiency\" Test (If Relevant):** Is the action (A) alone, by itself, enough to guarantee the outcome (O) without relying on other pre-existing conditions? (Especially critical if the question asks about sufficiency).\n\n**Step 2: Refine for Majority Judgment (If Requested)**\n*Only apply these principles if the question asks for what \"most people\" would say or uses general causal language like \"caused\" or \"because\".*\n-   **Proximate Cause Salience:** People often identify the most immediate, direct, and unexpected trigger of an outcome as \"the cause.\"\n-   **Normality, Deviance, and Omission:** An action that is an abnormal deviation from the expected course of events is a stronger candidate for being \"the cause.\" An **inaction** is rarely seen as \"the cause\" unless it was a *deviation from a required or expected action* (e.g., a guard failing to watch a monitor). A normal, passive inaction (e.g., not moving an object that is already correctly positioned) is typically not seen as the cause.\n-   **Causal Sufficiency (Common-Sense):** An action that people perceive as \"enough\" on its own to bring about the outcome is a stronger candidate.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize for the Requested Judgment**\n-   **If the question asks for a logician's view:** Base your final answer strictly on the logical tests in Step 1. Ignore common-sense principles like salience and normality.\n-   **If the question asks for a majority view (e.g., \"the majority of people\", or uses \"caused\"/\"because\" without specification):** Combine the logical analysis (Step 1) with the common-sense principles (Step 2) to predict what most people would say.

If Reagent X touches the crystal, the crystal dissolves. If, when added, Reagent X does not touch the crystal, Sam adds Reagent Y, which leads the crystal to dissolve. Is adding Reagent X to the beaker a necessary cause for the crystal to dissolve? Reply based on the answer a logician would give.\n**Reasoning (Step 0):** The question specifies \"a logician would give.\" I will use only formal logic.\n**Reasoning (Step 1 - But For):** Would the crystal dissolve if Reagent X were not added? Yes, because Sam would add Reagent Y. Therefore, adding Reagent X is not logically necessary.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example: Sufficiency Test]\n**Input:** Question: Reagent X is being added to a tank. At each time interval, a drop of Reagent X is being added. At one point the tank overflows. Is adding the last drop of Reagent X a sufficient cause for the tank to overflow? Reply based on the answer a logician would give.\n**Reasoning (Step 0):** The question specifies \"a logician\" and asks about a \"sufficient cause.\"\n**Reasoning (Step 1 - Sufficiency Test):** Is the last drop alone, by itself, enough to cause the overflow? No. The last drop is only sufficient because of the pre-existing condition of the tank being nearly full due to all prior drops. A logician would say the last drop is necessary but not sufficient on its own.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example: Normality of Omission]\n**Input:** Question: Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device? Reply Yes or No based on the answer the majority of people would give.\n**Reasoning (Step 0):** The question asks for the \"majority of people\" view. The action (A) is an inaction: Wayne did not change the position.\n**Reasoning (Step 1 - But For):** But for Wayne not changing the position, the device might have been moved off the pad and would not have charged. Logically, the inaction is necessary.\n**Reasoning (Step 2 - Refine for Majority):** However, the inaction is normal and expected. He saw it was correct and left it alone. People attribute outcomes to active, salient events or deviant omissions. They would say the device charged \"because it was left on the charging pad\" or \"because it was plugged in,\" not \"because Wayne didn't move it.\" The latter is an overly literal attribution of cause.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>No</answer>\n\n### Final Reasoning Steps ###\n1.  **(Step 0)** Identify (A) and (O). Determine the question's demand (logician vs. majority).\n2.  **(Step 1)** Apply the relevant formal tests (\"But For\" for necessity, \"Sufficiency\" for sufficiency).\n3.  **(Step 2)** If reasoning for a majority, refine the logical answer using the principles of Proximate Cause Salience, Normality/Deviance/Omission, and Common-Sense Sufficiency.\n4.  **(Step 3)** Synthesize to reach a final judgment that matches the question's demand.\n\n**Final Answer Format:**\nAfter your reasoning, provide your final answer on a new line as: `<answer>Yes</answer>`, `<answer>No</answer>`, or `<answer>Ambiguous</answer>`.\n\nNow, analyze the following question.

An action that deviates from this norm is more likely to be seen as a cause.\n5.  **Causal Sufficiency:** People identify a cause as the factor that made the difference between the outcome happening and not happening *in that specific situation*.\n\n**Avoid Common Mistakes:**\n-   Do not confuse a *necessary condition* with what people will call *the cause*. People often overlook necessary conditions if they are normal or expected.\n-   Do not ignore intent.

            "prompt": "You are an expert in causal reasoning. Analyze the given scenario and determine the causal relationship based on the specific question asked. Your analysis must distinguish between necessary causes, sufficient causes, and attributions of responsibility.\n\n**Key Principles for Your Analysis:**\n1.  **Necessary Cause:** An action is a necessary cause if the outcome would not have occurred without it. Apply the \"but for\" test rigorously.\n2.  **Sufficient Cause:** An action is a sufficient cause if it alone guarantees the outcome, regardless of other potential factors.\n3.  **Causal Responsibility (Blame):** When assessing responsibility, consider norms, intentions, and the distinction between actions and omissions. An action that violates a rule or is intentional is often assigned greater causal weight.\n4.  **Acts vs. Omissions:** Humans often assign less causal weight to omissions than to actions. The primary cause is typically the active agent that directly brought about the outcome.\n5.  **Causal Redundancy:** If multiple factors would have led to the same outcome, then a specific factor is not a necessary cause.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n1.  **Classify the Question:** Determine what is being asked:\n    -   Is it about *necessity* (\"did A cause O?\")? → Use the \"but for\" test.\n    -   Is it about *sufficiency* (\"was A a sufficient cause?\")? → Determine if A alone guarantees O.\n    -   Is it about *responsibility/blame* (\"was A responsible?\" / \"did A cause O?\" as per majority opinion)? → First apply the \"but for\" test, then adjust based on human intuitions (omission bias, norm violation, intentionality).\n2.  **Identify the Action (A) and Outcome (O):** Extract them precisely from the question.\n3.  **Construct the Relevant Counterfactual:**\n    -   For necessity: Imagine a world where A did *not* happen. Would O still have occurred in the specific manner described?\n    -   For sufficiency: Imagine a world where A *did* happen. Does it guarantee O?\n4.  **Evaluate:** Apply the principles above. Consider alternative causes, norms, and intentions.\n5.  **Synthesize for \"Majority Opinion\":** If asked, combine your logical analysis with common human intuitions:\n    -   **Omission Bias:** We blame actions more than failures to act.\n    -   **Norm Violation:** We assign more responsibility to those who break rules.\n    -   **Intentionality:** We assign more causation to intentional acts than accidental ones.\n\n**Final Answer Format:**\nAfter your reasoning, provide your final answer on a new line as: `<answer>Yes</answer>`, `<answer>No</answer>`, or `<answer>Ambiguous</answer>`.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n\n[Example 1: Sufficient Cause]\n**Input:** Question: Sam intends to add Reagent X to a mixture to make it explode. However, Sam does not add the reagent to the mixture. Bob add an anti-explosion Reagent Y to the mixture. The mixture would explode if Reagent X is added without the addition of Reagent Y. The mixture does not explode. Is Sam not adding Reagent X to the mixture a sufficient cause for mixture not exploding? Reply based on the answer a logician would give.\n**Reasoning:** The question asks about *sufficient cause*. Sam's omission (not adding X) is a sufficient cause for the mixture not exploding. In the actual world, his non-action completely explains the lack of explosion. The presence of Reagent Y is a separate, redundant sufficient cause. A logician would recognize that an event can have multiple sufficient causes.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>\n\n[Example 2: Responsibility & Omissions]\n**Input:** Question: Did the fertilization by Benni cause the plant to dry out? Reply Yes or No based on the answer the majority of people would give.\n**Reasoning:** The question asks for the majority opinion on responsibility. While Benni's application of B Y33R was a necessary factor in the plant drying (but-for test), the majority of people would likely attribute primary *responsibility* to Alex's mistake (funneling into the wrong can and misinforming Benni) or Tom's prior omission (leaving a dangerous chemical stored improperly). Benni was following instructions and acted without knowledge of the error. Human intuition often blames the source of the error (an action) more than the unknowing executor (an action based on a mistake).\n**Final Answer:** <answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example 3: Norm Violation]\n**Input:** Question: Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail? Reply Yes or No based on the answer the majority of people would give.\n**Reasoning:** The question asks for the majority opinion. Logically, Jim's action was necessary for the failure. However, Jim was explicitly forbidden from using his lamp, while Carol was permitted. The majority of people would assign causation and blame to the person who violated the rule. Carol's action, being permissible, would be seen as a background condition, not the primary cause.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>\n\n[Example 4: Acts vs. Omissions]\n**Input:** Question: Was Harmon out of the game because Zach did not tell Harmon where the other team's Basher was? Reply Yes or No based on the answer the majority of people would give.\n**Reasoning:** The question asks for the majority opinion on an omission. While Zach's failure to warn was a necessary condition (but-for test), the majority of people would identify the primary cause as the **action** of the opposing Basher who threw the ball. Zach's **omission** (not warning) is seen as a failure to prevent harm, not the active cause of it. Human judgment typically attributes less causal weight to omissions compared to actions.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>No</answer>\n\nNow, analyze the following question.

Your task is to analyze the scenario and question, then provide the requested answer by applying the appropriate structured framework.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Question Type**\nFirst, read the question carefully to determine what kind of answer is being requested.\n-   **Type L (Logical):** The question asks for a \"logician's\" answer, a \"strict\" answer, or invokes the \"but-for\" test. Prioritize logical analysis.\n-   **Type I (Intuitive):** The question asks for the \"majority opinion,\" what \"most people would say,\" or what is \"intuitive.\" Prioritize psychological analysis.\n-   **Type F (Factual):** The question asks for a direct yes/no without specification. Apply the full framework but lean on the logical baseline unless strong intuitive factors are present.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Structured Framework**\n\n**2a. Identify the Action and Outcome:** Clearly state the specified action/omission and the outcome.\n\n**2b. Perform a Strict Logical Analysis (Crucial for all types):**\n-   Apply the **\"But-For\" Test:** \"Would the outcome have occurred *but for* the specified action?\"\n    -   **Yes:** The action is a logical cause (necessary condition).\n    -   **No:** The action is not a logical cause.\n-   Identify cases of **Overdetermination** (multiple sufficient causes present) and **Pre-emption** (one cause blocks another).\n\n**2c. Predict the Intuitive Human Response (For Type I questions, or to inform Type F):**\nHumans are influenced by these factors, listed in rough order of importance in cases of conflict:\n    1.  **Normality & Morality:** Is the action a violation of norms or laws? (*Key Principle: The abnormal or immoral event is disproportionately assigned causal strength, even if logically redundant.*)\n    2.  **Role & Duty:** Was the agent the one specifically responsible for the outcome? Omissions by responsible agents are heavily blamed.\n    3.  **Intentionality & Foreseeability:** Did the agent intend the outcome? Should they have known?\n    4.  **Temporal Order & Salience:** Did the action happen last? Is it the most noticeable event?\n    5.  **Counterfactual Availability:** Can people easily imagine a different, better outcome? This is harder when alternative causes exist.\n    6.  **Causal Sufficiency & Redundancy:** Was the action one of multiple sufficient causes? If yes, intuitive attribution is reduced **only if the action is also perceived as normal or non-deviant**.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize and Judge Based on Question Type**\n-   **For Type L (Logical):** Your answer is the result of the \"But-For\" Test in 2b. Do not let intuitive factors change this answer.\n-   **For Type I (Intuitive):** Weigh the factors from 2c. The logical answer (2b) is just one input.\n    -   If factors are deeply conflicting and no clear majority exists, answer **Ambiguous**.\n    -   If the action was logically necessary but abnormal (e.g., the black wire), people may still see it as *a* cause, but assign primary blame to the abnormal factor. A answer of **Yes** is often still appropriate for the question \"Did X cause Y?\" even if it wasn't the only cause.\n-   **For Type F (Factual):** The logical answer (2b) is your baseline. If strong intuitive factors (especially Normality/Morality) overwhelmingly contradict it, side with intuition. Otherwise, side with logic.\n\n**Step 4: Final Judgment**\nYour final answer must be exactly **Yes**, **No**, or **Ambiguous**.\n\n**Critical Examples to Avoid Common Mistakes:**\n<example_critical_typeL>\nScenario: Alice intends to fire a bullet at a window.

Reply based on the answer the majority of people would give.\nReasoning:\n1.  Question Type: I (Intuitive).\n2.  Action: Black wire touching. Outcome: Short circuit.\n3.  Strict But-For Test: Yes, the short circuit would not have occurred without the black wire touching. It is logically a cause.\n4.  Intuitive Response: The black wire's action was normal and expected. The red wire's action was abnormal and forbidden. People will attribute causation primarily to the abnormal event (red wire). They will see the black wire's role as background and non-deviant.

Do not simply restate the logical answer. Humans are influenced by:\n    - **Temporal Order:** Did the action happen immediately before the outcome? (Later actions are often seen as more causal.)\n    - **Normality & Morality:** Was the action a violation of norms or laws? (**CRITICAL: This factor drives blame. However, if the action was redundant for the outcome, intuitive causal attribution is often reduced or denied. Do not let blame override a logical conclusion of redundancy.**)\n    - **Intentionality & Foreseeability:** Did the agent intend the outcome? Should they have known it would happen?\n    - **Counterfactual Availability:** Can people easily imagine a world where the action didn't happen *and the outcome was prevented*? If another sufficient cause exists, this counterfactual is hard to imagine, reducing causal attribution.\n    - **Causal Sufficiency & Redundancy:** Was the action one of multiple possible causes that were each sufficient on their own? If yes, intuitive attribution is often reduced or denied.\n    - **Action Necessity in a System:** Was the action one of many identical elements in a larger system (e.g., one student in a curved class, one voter in an election)? If the outcome would have occurred even without this specific element, intuitive causal attribution to it is greatly reduced.\n4.  **Synthesize and Judge:** Weigh these intuitive factors. If they are deeply conflicting, predicting a split opinion, answer **Ambiguous**.\n5.  **Final Judgment:** Your final answer must be exactly **Yes**, **No**, or **Ambiguous**, reflecting the predicted majority intuitive response.\n\n**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**\n<example_correct>\nScenario: Claire is logged on. Daniel logs on at the same time, causing the computer to crash.\nQuestion: Did Daniel cause the computer crash? (Majority Opinion)\nReasoning:\n1.  Action: Daniel logging on. Outcome: Computer crash.\n2.  Strict But-For Test: Yes, the crash would not have occurred without Daniel's login.\n3.  Intuitive Response: People see Claire's login as the background state. Daniel's action, happening afterwards, is the abnormal, triggering event. The majority would likely say Yes.\nJudgment: Yes\n</example_correct>\n\n<example_avoid_mistake>\nScenario: Alice logs in at 9 am. Zoe logs in at 9 am, triggering an email glitch that requires two simultaneous logins.\nQuestion: Did Zoe cause the email to be sent? (Majority Opinion)\nReasoning:\n1.  Action: Zoe logging in. Outcome: Email sent.\n2.  Strict But-For Test: Yes, the email would not have been sent without Zoe's login.\n3.  Intuitive Response: Human intuition is split in pre-emption cases. Some blame Zoe, others Alice, others the system. Opinion is roughly 50-50.\nJudgment: Ambiguous\n</example_avoid_mistake>\n\n<example_correct_but_challenging>\nScenario: Mr. Carlson chooses a dish with wine sauce for Karen, who has a fatal allergy. The alternative dish also had wine sauce.\nQuestion: Did Mr. Carlson's choice cause Karen's death? (Majority Opinion)\nReasoning:\n1.  Action: Choosing the dish. Outcome: Death.\n2.  Strict But-For Test: No, the death would have occurred regardless.\n3.  Intuitive Response: LOGICALLY, the answer is No. When the redundancy (both dishes had wine sauce) is explicitly stated, the majority intuition shifts to No. People see that the choice was irrelevant and the outcome was inevitable. Mr. Carlson is blameworthy for not checking, but he is not seen as the *cause* of death.\nJudgment: No\n</example_correct_but_challenging>\n\n<new_example_critical>\nScenario: Billy steals a battery. Suzy independently buys an identical battery. Either battery alone is sufficient to start the car. The car starts.\nQuestion: Did Billy cause the car to start? (Majority Opinion)\nReasoning:\n1.  Action: Billy stealing the battery. Outcome: Car starts.\n2.  Strict But-For Test: No. The car would have started from Suzy's battery regardless.\n3.  Intuitive Response: While Billy's theft is salient and immoral, people intuitively grasp causal redundancy. They recognize the outcome was guaranteed by Suzy's lawful action. Billy's act is seen as redundant. The majority would say he is a thief but did not *cause* the car to start.\nJudgment: No\n</new_example_critical>\n\n<new_example_system_redundancy>\nScenario: A group of students obtained a copy of a final exam. John Granger went along but did not cheat. The class is graded on a curve (top 20 get an A). Granger got the 20th highest score. The 21st student, a pre-med, missed a medical school cutoff because she got a B.\nQuestion: Did Granger cause the student to fail to meet the cutoff? (Majority Opinion)\nReasoning:\n1.  Action: Granger obtaining the exam (without cheating). Outcome: Pre-med student misses cutoff.\n2.  Strict But-For Test: No. The outcome was determined by the fixed curve. The pre-med student was 21st. Even if Granger had not been involved, the 20th score would have come from another student; she would still have been 21st.\n3.  Intuitive Response: Granger's action is immoral. However, because he did not cheat, his score was his own. In a large, curved system, people understand that one person's legitimate performance does not \"cause\" another to miss a cutoff. The outcome is overdetermined by the existence of 20 other high-scoring students. The majority would say No, though they might blame him for the unethical act.\nJudgment: No\n</new_example_system_redundancy>\n\n**Scenario:**\n{Scenario}\n\n**Question:**\n{Question}\n\nNow, reason step by step.

Strict But-For Test: No, because Claire's shot would have won it regardless.\n3.  Intuitive Response: Louie's shot was first, intentional, and achieved the goal early.

The combination damages plants.\nQuestion: Did Benni cause the damage? (Majority Opinion)\nReasoning:\n1.  Action: Benni applying B. Outcome: Damage.\n2.  Strict But-For Test: Yes, damage would not occur without B.\n3.  Intuitive Response: Benni's action was necessary for the harm (Rule A).

Action: Billy stealing the battery. Outcome: Car starts.\n2.  Strict But-For Test: No. The car would have started from Suzy's battery regardless.\n3.  Intuitive Response: While Billy's theft is salient, people intuitively grasp causal redundancy. The outcome was guaranteed by Suzy's lawful action. The majority would say he did not *cause* the car to start.\nJudgment: No\n</example_redundant_not_causal>\n\n<example_symmetric_ambiguous>\nScenario: Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM.

At the exact same time, he spins a spinner that lands on green (also sufficient to win). He wins.\nQuestion: Did Alex spinning the spinner cause him to win? (Majority Opinion)\nReasoning:\n1.  Action: Spinning the spinner. Outcome: Win.\n2.  Strict But-For Test: No. The win would have occurred from the dice roll regardless.\n3.  Intuitive Response: The dice roll (12) is a highly salient and sufficient cause. The spinner's result is redundant and its effect is completely overshadowed (Rule D).

                        "prompt": "You are an expert in causal reasoning and intuitive judgment prediction. Analyze the scenario and determine the majority intuitive human response by applying a structured framework that combines logical analysis with psychological factors.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n1.  **Identify the Action and Outcome:** Clearly state the specified action and the outcome described in the question.\n2.  **Determine the Answer Type:** Is the question asking for the *majority intuitive response* or a *strictly logical analysis* (e.g., \"a logician would give\")? This dictates the focus of your final judgment.\n3.  **Apply the Strict \"But-For\" Test (Logical Baseline):** Ask: \"Would the outcome have occurred *but for* the specified action?\"\n    - If the answer is no (the outcome would NOT have happened without the action), then the action is a *necessary* cause.\n    - If the outcome would have occurred regardless of the action, it is not a necessary cause.\n    - Carefully consider cases of **overdetermination** (multiple sufficient causes), **pre-emption** (one cause pre-empts another), and **joint causation** (multiple necessary causes).\n4.  **If Asked About Sufficiency (Logical Analysis Only):** Ask: \"Was the action alone, in the absence of any other contributing factors, enough to produce the outcome?\" An action is sufficient if it guarantees the outcome by itself. Many causes are **INUS conditions** (an *I*nsufficient but *N*ecessary part of a *U*nnecessary but *S*ufficient set).\n5.  **Predict the Intuitive Human Response (Majority Opinion):** Predict what most people would say based on common-sense reasoning. Do not simply restate the logical answer. Humans are influenced by:\n    - **Temporal Order & Primacy:** Did the action happen immediately before the outcome? Was it the *first* action to achieve the goal? (Later or first actions are often seen as more causal.)\n    - **Normality & Morality:** Was the action a violation of norms or laws? (Negative actions are often blamed but may not be seen as causal if redundant. Positive or neutral actions are often seen as causal if salient.)\n    - **Intentionality & Foreseeability:** Did the agent intend the outcome? Should they have known it would happen?\n    - **Counterfactual Availability:** Can people easily imagine a world where the action didn't happen *and the outcome was prevented*?\n    - **Causal Sufficiency & Redundancy:** Was the action one of multiple sufficient causes? If yes, intuitive attribution may be reduced. **Crucially, if causes are symmetrical** (simultaneous, equally salient/normal), attribution is often reduced or denied.\n    - **Salience & Goal Achievement:** Was the action a visible, intentional act that successfully achieved the outcome? (People often focus on what actually happened and discount alternatives.)\n6.  **Synthesize and Judge:** Weigh these intuitive factors carefully. If they are deeply conflicting, predicting a split opinion, answer **Ambiguous**.\n7.  **Final Judgment:** \n    - If the question asks for a *logician's view*, base your answer solely on the logical analysis (Steps 3 and 4).\n    - If the question asks for the *majority intuitive response*, base your answer on the synthesis in Step 5.\n    Your final answer must be exactly **Yes**, **No**, or **Ambiguous**.\n\n**Critical Examples to Guide Reasoning:**\n<example_correct>\nScenario: Claire is logged on. Daniel logs on at the same time, causing the computer to crash.\nQuestion: Did Daniel cause the computer crash? (Majority Opinion)\nReasoning:\n1.  Action: Daniel logging on.

Intuitive Response: People see Claire's login as the background state. Daniel's action, happening afterwards, is the abnormal, triggering event. The majority would likely say Yes.\nJudgment: Yes\n</example_correct>\n\n<example_preemption_ambiguous>\nScenario: Alice logs in at 9 am. Zoe logs in at 9 am, triggering an email glitch that requires two simultaneous logins.\nQuestion: Did Zoe cause the email to be sent? (Majority Opinion)\nReasoning:\n1.  Action: Zoe logging in. Outcome: Email sent.\n2.  Type: Majority intuitive.\n3.  But-For Test: Yes, the email would not have been sent without Zoe's login.\n4.  (Not needed)\n5.  Intuitive Response: Human intuition is split in pre-emption cases. Some blame Zoe, others Alice, others the system.

Type: Majority intuitive.\n3.  But-For Test: No, because Claire's shot would have won it regardless.\n4.  (Not needed)\n5.  Intuitive Response: Louie's shot was *first*, intentional, and achieved the goal early. People focus on this salient, goal-achieving action and overlook the redundancy.\nJudgment: Yes\n</example_redundant_but_causal>\n\n<example_symmetrical_redundancy>\nScenario: Two identical rocks, thrown by two people at the same time, hit a window and break it.

Type: Majority intuitive.\n3.  But-For Test: No. The window would have broken from Person B's throw regardless.\n4.  (Not needed)\n5.  Intuitive Response: The causes are perfectly symmetrical in timing and salience. There is no feature (like being first or immoral) to privilege one cause over the other. The intuitive grasp of redundancy is strong. The majority would say No.\nJudgment: No\n</example_symmetrical_redundancy>\n\n<example_logician_view>\nScenario: Reagent X is being added to a tank. At each time interval, a drop is added. At one point the tank overflows.\nQuestion: Is adding the last drop of Reagent X a sufficient cause for the tank to overflow? (A logician's view)\nReasoning:\n1.  Action: Adding the last drop. Outcome: Tank overflows.\n2.  Type: Logician's view.\n3.  But-For Test: Yes, the overflow would not have occurred without the last drop. It is necessary.\n4.  Sufficiency Test: No. A single drop is not sufficient to overflow a tank; it requires the tank to be nearly full from previous drops. The sufficient cause is the *total volume* exceeding capacity. The last drop is a necessary part of that sufficient set but is not sufficient itself.\n5.

But for the poison, the victim would have been alive to be shot. The shot alone would have caused death, but the poison pre-empted it.\n3.

Then, you must provide a final answer that follows the specific instruction given in the **Question** (e.g., \"what most people would say\" or \"what a logician would say\"). Your reasoning must justify the final answer based on that instruction.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n1.  **Parse Scenario Mechanics:** Determine from the scenario description the causal mechanism. Identify if the action is a *necessary* cause (e.g., \"only happens if two people log in\"), a *sufficient* cause (e.g., \"the bullet would have shattered the window on its own\"), or if the cause is *overdetermined* (multiple sufficient causes). This is essential before applying any test.\n2.  **Identify the Action and Outcome:** Clearly state the action in question and the outcome described.\n3.  **Apply the \"But-For\" Test (for logical analysis):** Ask, \"Would the outcome have occurred *but for* the specified action?\" If the answer is no (the outcome would NOT have happened without the action), then the action is a cause. Answer **Yes** for a logician.\n4.  **Treat Omissions as Actions:** A person's failure to act can be a cause if it meets the but-for test.\n5.  **Ignore Intent, Blame, and Normality (for logical analysis):** Do not consider if the action was intentional, accidental, reasonable, or morally right. The \"abnormality\" of an event is irrelevant. Focus only on the causal dependency.\n6.  **Analyze Joint Causes and Overdetermination:**\n    *   **Joint Causation:** If the outcome requires multiple actions (e.g., two causes that must combine to produce the effect), then each necessary action is a cause. Apply the but-for test to each action individually; it will show each is necessary.\n    *   **Overdetermination:** If multiple actions are individually sufficient to cause the outcome (e.g., two lethal bullets striking simultaneously), then the but-for test fails for each action (the outcome would have occurred without any one of them). A logician would typically say **No**, the action was not a *necessary* cause.\n7.  **Final Judgment:** Based on the above analysis and the specific question instruction, decide your final answer. Your final answer must be exactly **Yes**, **No**, or **Ambiguous**.\n    *   For a **logician**, base your answer strictly on the but-for test.\n    *   For **human judgment**, base your answer on typical intuitive responses. People often assign causality to the most salient or recent action, especially in cases of joint causation. They may deny causality in overdetermination cases. Use \"Ambiguous\" if the scenario is highly symmetric and likely to split opinion.\n    *   Use **Ambiguous** for logical judgment only if the scenario provides genuinely insufficient information (e.g., it is unknown whether one cause was sufficient).\n\n**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**\n<example_original>\nScenario: Claire is logged on. Daniel logs on at the same time, causing the computer to crash.\nQuestion: Did Claire cause the computer crash?\nReasoning:\n1.  Mechanism: The crash only happens if two people are logged on (joint causation).\n2.  Action: Claire being logged on. Outcome: Computer crash.\n3.  But-For Test: Would the crash have occurred *but for* Claire being logged on? No. Without Claire, the two-login condition is not met.\n4.  Omissions/Intent: Ignored.\n5.  Joint Causes: Both logins were necessary.\n6.  Final Judgment (Logical): Yes\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n</example_original>\n\n<example_original>\nScenario: Alex applies fertilizer A. Benni applies fertilizer B. Plants dry up only where both are applied.\nQuestion: Did Benni's fertilization cause the plants to dry out?\nReasoning:\n1.  Mechanism: Damage only occurs where both fertilizers are applied (joint causation).\n2.  Action: Benni applying his fertilizer. Outcome: Plants drying out.\n3.  But-For Test: For these plants, would they have dried *but for* Benni's action? No.\n4.  Omissions/Intent: Ignored.\n5.  Joint Causes: Both actions were necessary.\n6.  Final Judgment (Logical): Yes\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n</example_original>\n\n<example_new type=\"overdetermination\">\nScenario: Killer A and Killer B independently fire lethal shots at Victim at the same time. Either shot alone would have been fatal. Victim dies.\nQuestion: Did Killer A's shot cause the death? Reply as a logician.\nReasoning:\n1.  Mechanism: Each shot is described as \"lethal\" and \"would have been fatal\" alone. This is overdetermination.\n2.  Action: Killer A firing. Outcome: Victim's death.\n3.  But-For Test: Would the victim have died *but for* Killer A's shot? Yes, because Killer B's shot was sufficient.\n4.  Omissions/Intent: Ignored.\n5.  Overdetermination: The but-for test fails for Killer A's action.\n6.  Final Judgment (Logical): The action was not a necessary cause. Answer No.\n<answer>No</answer>\n</example_new>\n\n<example_new type=\"human_judgment\">\nScenario: Alice logs in at 9 am. Zoe logs in at 9 am. An empty email is sent only if two people are logged in.\nQuestion: Did Zoe cause the email to be sent? Reply based on what most people would say.\nReasoning:\n1.  Mechanism: The email is sent only if two people are logged in (joint causation).\n2.  Action: Zoe logging in. Outcome: Email sent.\n3.  But-For Test (Logical): Would the email have been sent *but for* Zoe logging in? No. Logically, Yes.\n4.  Human Judgment: Human intuition is often influenced by an action being the decisive, final step that completes a causal chain. Since Alice was already logged in, Zoe's action is the salient cause that changed the state from \"safe\" to \"email sent.\" The majority of people would likely say Yes.\n5.  Final Judgment: The answer aligns with the logical conclusion and intuitive salience.

        "prompt": "Answer questions about tables of animals (e.g., penguins or giraffes) and their attributes. Follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant table** based on the animal mentioned in the question. Ignore all other tables.\n2.  **Include all entities** from the original table and any explicitly added ones (e.g., \"We now add a penguin...\").\n3.  For **counting or lookup questions**, iterate through each entity in the relevant table:\n    *   Check the condition(s) precisely (e.g., \"age > 5\", \"height = 70\").\n    *   For compound conditions (AND), an entity must satisfy all conditions to be counted.\n4.  For **\"first\" or \"last\"** questions, use the order of entities as they appear in the table.\n5.  For **arithmetic operations** (e.g., sum), first extract all relevant numerical values, then compute step-by-step.\n6.  Provide a concise, step-by-step explanation before giving your final answer enclosed in <answer> tags.\n\nExample for a counting question:\n*Step: List each penguin. Check if age < 8 AND weight < 12. Only Louis meets both conditions. Count: 1.*\n<answer>1</answer>\n\nExample for a lookup question:\n*Step: Check each penguin's height. Gwen is 70 cm tall.*\n<answer>Gwen</answer>\n\nExample for a sum question:\n*Step: The ages are: 7, 5, 9, 8, 12. Sum = 7+5+9+8+12 = 41.*\n<answer>41</answer>",

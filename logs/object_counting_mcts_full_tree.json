Your task is to count specific objects of a requested category within a statement.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1.  **Identify and Extract:** Read the input carefully. Identify every distinct mention of an object, paying close attention to commas and conjunctions like \"and\" to separate items.\n2.  **Parse Quantities:** For each distinct mention, extract the exact quantity.\n    - Explicit numbers (e.g., \"three cows\") → stated number.\n    - Singular articles (e.g., \"a bear\", \"an apple\") → quantity 1.\n    - Collective nouns (e.g., \"a pack of dogs,\" \"a bunch of grapes\") → treat as 1 single item.\n3.  **Category Filtering:** Verify which extracted objects belong to the requested category. Explicitly exclude and justify the exclusion of any non-matching items.\n4.  **List and Sum:** Create a bulleted list of each distinct, category-appropriate mention with its parsed quantity. Then, sum all the quantities to get the final answer.\n5.  **Output Format:** First, reason step-by-step following the instructions above. Then, box your final answer as `<answer>N</answer>`.\n\n**Example:**\nInput: \"I have a bear, two rabbits, and a cat. How many animals?\"\nOutput:\nLet's list each distinct mention and its quantity:\n- \"a bear\" -> Quantity: 1 (animal)\n- \"two rabbits\" -> Quantity: 2 (animal)\n- \"a cat\" -> Quantity: 1 (animal)\nSum: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4\n<answer>4</answer>",

                "prompt": "You are an expert at precise counting and enumeration. Your task is to count all individual objects described in a statement that belong to a specific category.\n\n**Instructions:**\n**Step 1: Parse and Segment the Input List**\n*   Carefully read the input statement. Isolate the part of the sentence that contains the list of items (e.g., the clause after \"I have...\").\n*   **Crucially, split this list on every comma (',') and the word 'and'.** Treat \"and\" as a separator, not part of an object's name. This will give you a raw list of item phrases.\n*   **Clean each item phrase:** Remove any leading/trailing spaces. Also remove the words \"a\", \"an\", \"the\", or \"and\" if they appear at the very beginning of a phrase. Your goal is to isolate the core noun phrase (e.g., \"bear\", \"three cows\", \"head of broccoli\").\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Count Category Objects**\nFor each cleaned item phrase from Step 1:\n*   If the phrase begins with a number (e.g., \"three cows\", \"two apples\"), the quantity for that object is that number. **This creates multiple countable items** (e.g., \"three cows\" = 3 items).\n*   If the phrase does not begin with a number (e.g., \"bear\", \"stalk of celery\"), the quantity is 1.\n*   **For Collective Nouns and Units:** Treat phrases like \"pack of dogs,\" \"stalk of celery,\" or \"head of broccoli\" as a reference to **one individual object** (e.g., one dog, one celery stalk, one broccoli head). The collective word (\"pack\", \"stalk\", \"head\") defines the *unit*, not the quantity.\n*   **For Plural Collective Nouns:** If a number modifies the collective unit (e.g., \"two heads of broccoli,\" \"three packs of dogs\"), the number defines how many of those units there are. Therefore, the quantity is that number. (e.g., \"two heads of broccoli\" = 2 broccoli heads = 2 items).\n\n**Step 3: List and Sum**\n*   Create a clear, bulleted list of each **cleaned item phrase** from Step 1 with its corresponding parsed quantity from Step 2.\n*   Then, sum all the quantities to get the final answer.\n\n**Step 4: Output Format**\n*   First, reason step-by-step following the instructions above. **You must explicitly show your parsed and cleaned list from Step 1.**\n*   Then, box your final answer as `<answer>N</answer>`.\n\n**Example (Illustrating List Parsing and Quantities):**\nInput: \"I have two heads of broccoli, a stalk of celery, and three carrots. How many vegetables?\"\nOutput:\n**Step 1: Parse and Segment the Input List**\n- Full list phrase: \"two heads of broccoli, a stalk of celery, and three carrots\"\n- Split on commas and 'and': [\"two heads of broccoli\", \"a stalk of celery\", \"three carrots\"]\n- Cleaned item phrases: [\"two heads of broccoli\", \"stalk of celery\", \"three carrots\"]\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Count**\n- \"two heads of broccoli\" -> Begins with a number. Quantity: 2\n- \"stalk of celery\" -> Does not begin with a number. Quantity: 1\n- \"three carrots\" -> Begins with a number. Quantity: 3\n\n**Step 3: Sum**\nSum: 2 + 1 + 3 = 6\n<answer>6</answer>",

Exhaustive Extraction:**\nRead the input and list every single item mentioned, one per line.\n*   **For Category Questions:** List each thing that belongs to a category. If a quantity is given (e.g., \"three cows\"), note the object and its count. **Remember: Conjunctions like \"and\" and \"or\" are not objects; they are grammatical list connectors. Ignore them.**\n*   **For Literal \"Objects\" Questions:** List every single noun phrase and the conjunction \"and\" as separate items. **Remember: The word \"and\" is itself a list item in this context. Extract it as a distinct object with a quantity of 1.** Treat \"a car\", \"an apple\", \"two snakes\", and \"and\" as individual objects to be counted, each with a quantity of 1 unless a number is explicitly stated (e.g., \"two snakes\" has a quantity of 2).\n\n**2. Categorization (ONLY for Category Questions):**\nIf the question specifies a category (e.g., \"fruits\"), determine if each extracted item belongs to it. Briefly justify your reasoning for any ambiguous item. If the question is a literal count (\"how many objects?\"), **SKIP THIS STEP ENTIRELY.**\n\n**3. Tabulation:**\nCreate a table. The columns depend on the question type:\n*   **For Category Questions:** \"Object\", \"Quantity\", \"Is [Category]? (Y/N)\".\n*   **For Literal \"Objects\" Questions:** \"Item\", \"Quantity\".\n\n**4. Summation:**\n*   **For Category Questions:** Sum the \"Quantity\" of all objects where \"Is [Category]?\" is \"Y\".\n*   **For Literal \"Objects\" Questions:** Sum the \"Quantity\" of all items in the table.\n\n**5. Verification:**\nDouble-check your extracted list against the original input. For literal counts, ensure every word functioning as a list item (including \"and\") is accounted for. Double-check your sum for accuracy.\n\nFinally, provide your final answer within <answer> tags.",

Follow these steps precisely.\n\n**CRITICAL PRE-STEP: QUESTION ANALYSIS**\n*   First, identify what the question is asking for.\n    *   If it asks for a specific category (e.g., \"fruits\", \"vegetables\", \"animals\"), you are counting **instances of things that belong to that category**.\n    *   If it asks for \"objects\" or \"things\" (e.g., \"how many objects do I have?\"), you are performing a **literal count of all distinct list items, including the conjunction \"and\"**. The word \"and\" is to be counted as a separate object in this context.\n\n**1. Exhaustive Extraction & Normalization:**\nRead the input and list every single item mentioned.\n*   **For Category Questions:** Extract each thing that belongs to a category.\n    *   **CRITICAL: Normalize the object name.** Identify the core noun being described. Ignore descriptive units like \"head of,\" \"stalk of,\" \"bunch of,\" \"piece of,\" etc. These units describe a single instance of the core noun.\n        *   Example: \"a head of broccoli\" -> core noun: `broccoli`, quantity: 1\n        *   Example: \"three lettuce heads\" -> core noun: `lettuce` (the word \"heads\" is part of the variety name and is kept: `lettuce head`), quantity: 3\n        *   Example: \"a stalk of celery\" -> core noun: `celery`, quantity: 1\n    *   If a quantity is given for a plural term (e.g., \"two chickens\"), the quantity applies to the *core noun*. This means \"two chickens\" represents two instances of the `chicken` object.\n    *   Ignore conjunctions like \"and\".\n*   **For Literal \"Objects\" Questions:** List every single noun phrase and the conjunction \"and\" as separate items. Treat \"a car\", \"an apple\", \"two snakes\", and \"and\" as individual objects to be counted. The word \"and\" is always an object with a quantity of 1.\n\n**2. Categorization (ONLY for Category Questions):**\nIf the question specifies a category (e.g., \"fruits\"), determine if each *normalized* extracted item belongs to it. Briefly justify your reasoning for any ambiguous item. If the question is a literal count (\"how many objects?\"), **SKIP THIS STEP ENTIRELY.**\n\n**3. Tabulation:**\nCreate a table. The columns depend on the question type:\n*   **For Category Questions:** \"Normalized Object\", \"Quantity\", \"Is [Category]? (Y/N)\".\n*   **For Literal \"Objects\" Questions:** \"Item\", \"Quantity\".\n\n**4. Summation:**\n*   **For Category Questions:** Sum the \"Quantity\" of all objects where \"Is [Category]?\" is \"Y\".\n*   **For Literal \"Objects\" Questions:** Sum the \"Quantity\" of all items in the table.\n\n**5. Verification:**\nDouble-check your extracted and normalized list against the original input.\n*   For category counts: Ensure you have decomposed descriptive phrases correctly (e.g., \"head of broccoli\" -> 1 `broccoli`). Ensure quantities for plural terms are applied to individual instances (e.g., \"two chickens\" -> 2 x `chicken`).\n*   For literal counts: ensure every word functioning as a list item (including \"and\") is accounted for.\nDouble-check your sum for accuracy.\n\nFinally, provide your final answer within <answer> tags.",

Your primary goal is to identify every single **instance of an object** mentioned.\n    *   Treat each noun phrase in the list as representing one or more object instances.\n    *   The words \"a\", \"an\", and \"one\" indicate a single instance (e.g., \"a car\" = 1 instance).\n    *   Numerical quantifiers indicate multiple instances (e.g., \"two cows\" = 2 instances, \"three toasters\" = 3 instances).\n    *   Pay close attention to the word \"and\" as it signifies the final item in a list; ensure this item is included.\n    *   Generate a preliminary list where each line corresponds to a single object instance. For example, for the phrase \"two apples and a car\", your list should be:\n        apple\n        apple\n        car\n\n**2.  Categorization:**\n    Review your list of instances. For each unique type of object present, determine if it belongs to the category specified in the user's question (e.g., \"vegetables\", \"musical instruments\").\n    *   If the categorization for an object type is non-trivial or ambiguous, provide a brief justification for your decision.\n\n**3.  Tabulation:**\n    Create a table with three columns: \"Instance\", \"Object Type\", and \"Is [Category]? (Y/N)\".\n    *   The \"Instance\" column will contain your complete list from Step 1, one instance per row.\n    *   The \"Object Type\" column will name the general category of the object in that row.\n    *   The \"Is [Category]?\" column will apply the categorization from Step 2. All instances of the same object type will receive the same value (Y or N).\n\n**4.  Summation:**\n    Calculate the final count by determining the number of rows in your table where the \"Is [Category]?\" column is \"Y\".\n    *   If the user's question is about the total number of objects (e.g., \"How many objects do I have?\"), then every row is considered a \"Y\". The answer is the total number of rows in the table.\n\n**5.  Verification:**\n    Double-check your work to ensure accuracy:\n    *   **Re-read the Input:** Count the number of noun phrases in the user's list (items separated by commas and \"and\"). Compare this to the number of unique object types you identified. This is a sanity check.\n    *   **Audit Instances:** For each noun phrase, confirm you created the correct number of instances (e.g., the phrase \"four pianos\" must result in four separate instances of \"piano\" in your table).\n    *   **Re-check Categorization:** Verify your Y/N decisions for object types, especially borderline cases.\n    *   **Recount:** Count the \"Y\" rows in your table again to confirm the sum.\n\nFinally, provide your final answer within <answer> tags.",

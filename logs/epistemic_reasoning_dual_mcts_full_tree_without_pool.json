    "prompt": "**Task:** Perform Natural Language Inference (NLI). Determine if the Premise entails the Hypothesis.\n\n**Definition:** Entailment means that if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true.\n\n**Core Principle:**\n- A factive mental state (e.g., *knows, remembers, sees, realizes, is aware, notices, understands*) is one that, by definition, can only be true if its complement is true. Therefore, \"X [factive verb] Y\" logically entails Y is true.\n- If the Premise states that [Person A] has a mental state (e.g., believes, suspects, thinks, assumes) that [Person B] is in a factive state regarding [Event Y], then it is entailed that [Person A] has that mental state regarding [Event Y].\n\n**Critical Checks Before Reasoning:**\n1.  **Subject Check:** If the main subject (the person holding the belief) in the Premise is different from the subject in the Hypothesis, the answer is **non-entailment**.\n2.  **Verb Check:** If the embedded verb in the Premise is non-factive (e.g., *believes, thinks, suspects*), it **blocks entailment**.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n1.  Identify the main subject and their mental state verb in both Premise and Hypothesis. **If subjects differ, output non-entailment.**\n2.  Parse the Premise to find any embedded clauses. Identify the verb in the deepest clause.\n    - If this verb is **non-factive**, the outer mental state does not apply to the fact itself. Entailment is blocked.\n    - If this verb is **factive**, proceed.\n3.  Apply the factivity principle: `[Subject] [Mental State] that [X factive-verb Y]` is logically equivalent to `[Subject] [Mental State] that Y`.\n4.  Compare the derived statement to the Hypothesis. They must match in subject, mental state, and core proposition.\n5.  Perform the guarantee test: \"If the Premise is true, must the Hypothesis be true?\" If any doubt exists, answer non-entailment.\n6.  **Invariant:** Do not use real-world knowledge. Base analysis solely on logical structure and verb definitions.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n- ✅ Premise: \"Joseph assumes that Amelia understands that P.\"  \n  Hypothesis: \"Joseph assumes that P.\"  \n  Entailment: Yes. \"Understands\" is factive.\n\n- ❌ Premise: \"Taylor suspects that Olivia believes that P.\"  \n  Hypothesis: \"Taylor suspects that P.\"  \n  Entailment: No. \"Believes\" is non-factive.\n\n- ❌ Premise: \"Charlotte thinks that John sees that P.\"  \n  Hypothesis: \"John sees that P.\"  \n  Entailment: No. Subjects differ.\n\n**Output Format:**\nFirst, reason step by step. Then, output your final answer within the tags `<answer>entailment</answer>` or `<answer>non-entailment</answer>`.\n\n**Now, analyze the following:**\nPremise: {premise}\nHypothesis: {hypothesis}",

The Premise states that Isabella believes a complex proposition P: \"Michael sees that Q\".

If a factive verb is embedded under a belief, it means the main believer accepts the embedded content as true.\n        -   Example: \"A believes that B **knows** X\" → A believes that X is true.\n    -   **Non-Factive Verbs (e.g., \"thinks\", \"believes\", \"assumes\", \"suspects\"):** These verbs do not presuppose truth.

A factive mental state (e.g., *knows, remembers, sees, realizes, is aware, notices*) is one that, by definition, can only be true if its complement is true.\n- Therefore, if the Premise states that [Person A] has a mental state (e.g., believes, suspects, thinks) that [Person B] is in a factive state regarding [Event Y], then it is entailed that [Person A] has that mental state regarding [Event Y].\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n1.  Identify the main subject and their mental state (e.g., believes, suspects, knows) in both Premise and Hypothesis.\n2.  Analyze the content of the belief. Look for any embedded clauses containing factive verbs.\n3.  **Apply the factivity principle: For any factive verb F, \"X F Y\" logically entails Y is true.**\n4.

The subject's mental state applies to the entire entailed fact.\n5.  **Do not question the factual truth of the Premise in the real world.** Base your analysis solely on the logical structure and standard definitions of the words used.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n- Premise: \"Anna believes that Bob knows the car is red.\"\n  Hypothesis: \"Anna believes the car is red.\"\n  Entailment: Yes. \"Knows\" is factive; Bob knows Y entails Y. Therefore, Anna's belief entails she believes Y.\n\n- Premise: \"David suspects that Emma sees that the door is open.\"\n  Hypothesis: \"David suspects that the door is open.\"\n  Entailment: Yes. \"Sees\" is factive; Emma sees Y entails Y. Therefore, David's suspicion about Emma's perception entails his suspicion about Y.\n\n- Premise: \"Chris thinks that Diana remembers the meeting.\"\n  Hypothesis: \"Chris thinks there was a meeting.\"\n  Entailment: Yes. \"Remembers\" is factive.\n\n**Critical Example to Avoid Misinterpretation:**\n- Premise: \"Ava suspects that Charlotte sees that one man in baseball cap looks out while two men look down.\"\n  Hypothesis: \"Ava suspects that one man in baseball cap looks out while two men look down.\"\n  Entailment: Yes. \"Sees\" is a factive verb. \"Charlotte sees that P\" entails P is true.

Determine if the Premise entails the Hypothesis.\n\n**Definition:** Entailment means that if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis must also be true.\n\n**Core Principle:**\n- A factive mental state (e.g., *knows, remembers, sees, understands, realizes, notices, is aware*) requires its complement to be true. \"X [factive-verb] Y\" logically entails Y.\n- Therefore, if the Premise states that [Person A] has a mental state about [Person B] being in a factive state regarding [Event Y], then it is entailed that [Person A] has that mental state regarding [Event Y].\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n1.  **Identify Subjects and Verbs:** Determine the main subject and their mental state verb in both Premise and Hypothesis.\n2.  **Check Subject Alignment:** If the subjects differ, entailment fails unless the Premise's main verb is factive (e.g., \"remembers\").\n3.  **Scan for Factive Structure:** Look for the pattern: `[Mental State 1] that [Mental State 2] that [Proposition]`.\n4.  **Classify the Embedded Verb:** Is Mental State 2 factive?\n    -   **Yes:** Then `[Mental State 2] that [Prop]` entails `[Prop]`. Therefore, the person with Mental State 1 must believe `[Prop]`. **Entailment holds.**\n    -   **No:** The chain is broken. **Entailment fails.**\n5.  **Check the Outer Verb:** If the outermost verb in the Premise is factive, it entails its entire complement is true.\n6.  **Final Check:** Could the Premise be true while the Hypothesis is false? If yes, output `non-entailment`.\n\n**Critical Guidance:**\n-   **Do not question the factual truth** of the Premise. Base analysis solely on logical structure.\n-   **Non-factive verbs** (e.g., *believes, thinks, suspects, assumes*) do not guarantee the truth of their complement.\n\n**Examples:**\n-   Premise: \"Anna believes that Bob knows the car is red.\"\n    Hypothesis: \"Anna believes the car is red.\"\n    Entailment: Yes. \"Knows\" is factive.\n\n-   Premise: \"Michael assumes that Richard believes several children are on the beach.\"\n    Hypothesis: \"Richard believes several children are on the beach.\"\n    Entailment: No. \"Assumes\" is not factive.\n\n**Output Format:**\nFirst, reason step by step applying the rules above.

Therefore, \"X [factive verb] Y\" logically entails Y is true.\n- If the Premise states that [Person A] has a mental state (e.g., believes, suspects, thinks, assumes) that [Person B] is in a factive state regarding [Event Y], then it is entailed that [Person A] has that mental state regarding [Event Y].\n\n**Critical Checks Before Reasoning:**\n1.  **Subject Check:** If the main subject (the person holding the belief) in the Premise is different from the subject in the Hypothesis, the answer is **non-entailment**.\n2.  **Verb Check:** If the embedded verb in the Premise is non-factive (e.g., *believes, thinks, suspects*), it **blocks entailment**.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n1.  Identify the main subject and their mental state verb in both Premise and Hypothesis. **If subjects differ, output non-entailment.**\n2.  Parse the Premise to find any embedded clauses. Identify the verb in the deepest clause.\n    - If this verb is **non-factive**, the outer mental state does not apply to the fact itself. Entailment is blocked.\n    - If this verb is **factive**, proceed.\n3.  Apply the factivity principle: `[Subject] [Mental State] that [X factive-verb Y]` is logically equivalent to `[Subject] [Mental State] that Y`.\n4.  Compare the derived statement to the Hypothesis. They must match in subject, mental state, and core proposition.\n5.  Perform the guarantee test: \"If the Premise is true, must the Hypothesis be true?\" If any doubt exists, answer non-entailment.\n6.  **Invariant:** Do not use real-world knowledge. Base analysis solely on logical structure and verb definitions.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n- ✅ Premise: \"Joseph assumes that Amelia understands that P.\"  \n  Hypothesis: \"Joseph assumes that P.\"  \n  Entailment: Yes. \"Understands\" is factive.\n\n- ❌ Premise: \"Taylor suspects that Olivia believes that P.\"  \n  Hypothesis: \"Taylor suspects that P.\"  \n  Entailment: No. \"Believes\" is non-factive.\n\n- ❌ Premise: \"Charlotte thinks that John sees that P.\"  \n  Hypothesis: \"John sees that P.\"  \n  Entailment: No. Subjects differ.\n\n**Output Format:**\nFirst, reason step by step.

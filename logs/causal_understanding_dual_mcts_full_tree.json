    "prompt": "You are given a scenario about causality. Determine whether the specified action was **a cause** of the specified outcome. Your answer should reflect what the majority of people would conclude based on everyday notions of causality and responsibility.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Essential Requirement (But-for Test):** This is the definitive test. Ask: \"Would the outcome have occurred **at the specific time and in the specific way it did** if the action had **not** happened?\"\n    *   If the answer is **Yes** (the outcome would have happened anyway), then the action is **not a cause**. **Stop your reasoning here and answer `No`.** (Example: A redundant cause).\n    *   If the answer is **No** (the outcome would NOT have happened without the action), then the action is a **but-for cause**. Proceed to step 2 to check if people would still be *reluctant* to call it \"a cause\" due to normality or omission.\n\n2.  **Assigning Salience:** If the action passes the But-for test, people are more likely to call it \"a cause\" and assign responsibility if it was:\n    *   **Faulty:** A mistake, misconduct, or a deviation from instructions/plans.\n    *   **Intentional:** Done on purpose to bring about the outcome.\n    *   **Proximate:** The most direct and immediate event in the chain, not a distant background condition.\n    *   **An Action:** People are more likely to attribute causation to actions than to omissions, unless the omission violated a clear duty to act.\n    If the action was normal, non-faulty, and a distant background condition, people may be reluctant to call it \"the cause,\" but it remains *a* cause.\n\n**Final Decision Framework:**\n*   If the action **fails the But-for test**, answer `No`.\n*   If the action **passes the But-for test**, answer `Yes`, unless it was a **normal, non-faulty, distant background action or omission without a clear duty**. In these rare cases, answer `Ambiguous`.\n*   If two or more actions are equally but-for causes and the scenario does not clearly make one more salient (faulty, intentional, proximate), answer `Ambiguous`.\n\n**Ground your reasoning in the facts provided.** Do not invent detailed counterfactual scenarios or assume probabilities not stated in the question.\n\n**Important Examples to Consider:**\n- **Redundant Cause:** If a person does not change a setting, but the outcome would have happened anyway due to another condition, their inaction is `No`t a cause.\n- **Redundant Cause (Double Prevention):** If two independent actors each provide a sufficient condition for an outcome (e.g., both buy the only battery needed), neither action is a but-for cause. The answer for each is `No`.\n- **Normal vs. Faulty Action:** If a person buys an item normally (like a bookend) and this completes a pair only because another person stole a matching item, the purchase is a but-for cause. However, because the theft is faulty and salient, the majority would say the thief caused the possession of the pair, not the purchaser. The answer for the purchaser is `No`.\n- **Multiple Causes:** If two gardeners each apply a different chemical, and the combination causes harm, both are but-for causes. If neither acted faultily in the application itself (e.g., one just forgot to relay a rule), causation is shared and the answer for each is `Yes`.\n- **Pre-Existing Condition:** If a terminal illness guarantees death, and a medical error only changes the timing by a short period, the illness is the cause of the premature death (`Yes`), while the error is the cause of the immediate death.\n\n**Question:**\n{Question}\n\nAfter your reasoning, finalize your answer with `Yes`, `No`, or `Ambiguous`.",

Your task is to determine the correct answer based on the specific instructions in the question.\n\n### Reasoning Framework:\n1. **Interpret the Question's Instructions**: First, identify the perspective and type of causality asked for:\n   - If the question specifies \"a logician,\" focus strictly on logical necessity, sufficiency, and counterfactuals. Ignore normative factors like duty or morality.\n   - If the question asks for \"the majority of people,\" simulate common human judgment, which integrates counterfactual dependence, normative factors (e.g., duty for omissions), salience, and intention.\n   - If the question asks about a specific type of cause (e.g., \"sufficient cause\"), answer based on that definition.\n\n2. **Identify the Action and Outcome**: Clearly state the action (or omission) and the outcome in question.\n\n3. **Apply Counterfactual Tests**:\n   - For necessity: Ask \"Would the outcome have occurred if the action had not been performed?\" If no, the action is necessary.\n   - For sufficiency: Ask \"Does the action alone guarantee the outcome?\" Consider if other factors are needed.\n\n4. **Evaluate Based on the Requested Perspective**:\n   - **Logician's Perspective**: Rely only on logic:\n     - Necessity and sufficiency are determined strictly by counterfactuals and literal constraints.\n     - Preemption: If an action is preempted by another cause (e.g., death occurs before a poison acts), it is not a cause.\n     - Overdetermination: If multiple sufficient causes exist, no single one is necessary, but if the question is about sufficiency, evaluate accordingly.\n   - **Majority Human Perspective**: Simulate intuitive judgment:\n     - Necessity: People often say \"Yes\" if the action was counterfactually necessary.\n     - Norms: For omissions, people require a duty to act. Without duty, omissions are rarely causal.\n     - Salience: Active, intentional, or recent actions are more likely to be seen as causes.\n     - Preemption: People may still attribute causality to a preempted cause if it was salient or intentional.\n     - Inevitability: If the outcome was inevitable, people are less likely to attribute causation.\n\n5. **Resolve Ambiguities**:\n   - If the question is about a specific type of cause (e.g., \"sufficient cause\"), answer based on that, even if it conflicts with general causality.\n   - For human judgment, if the scenario has balanced cues (e.g., omission without duty but counterfactually necessary), people are often split, so answer \"Ambiguous\".\n\n6. **Final Decision**: Output only one of: <answer>Yes</answer>, <answer>No</answer>, or <answer>Ambiguous</answer>.\n\n### Examples for Guidance:\n- **Example 1 (Logician vs. People)**:\n  Question: \"Did A cause the outcome? Reply based on a logician.\"\n  Scenario: A shoots B. B is simultaneously hit by a falling piano. Either event alone is fatal.\n  Reasoning (Logician): A's shot was not necessary (B would have died from the piano). Answer: No.\n  Reasoning (People): Many would say A caused the death due to salience and intention. Answer: Yes or Ambiguous.\n  Final Answer for Logician: <answer>No</answer>\n\n- **Example 2 (Sufficient Cause)**:\n  Question: \"Was A's action a sufficient cause?\"\n  Scenario: A pushes B into a lake. B cannot swim but is rescued.\n  Reasoning: A's action did not guarantee death (rescue intervened). Not sufficient.\n  Final Answer: <answer>No</answer>\n\n- **Example 3 (Omission without Duty)**:\n  Question: \"Did Kate not oiling cause the breakdown? (Majority of people)\"\n  Scenario: Kate had no duty to oil; Janet was responsible.\n  Reasoning: No duty, so people say no, even if counterfactually necessary.\n  Final Answer: <answer>No</answer>\n\n- **Example 4 (Preemption)**:\n  Question: \"Did the poison cause death? (Majority of people)\"\n  Scenario: Poison was administered, but victim died in an explosion before poison could act.\n  Reasoning: Poison was preempted. Logician says no. People might focus on the explosion.\n  Final Answer: <answer>No</answer> (but if question specifies logician, same answer).\n\n- **Example 5 (Ambiguous Case)**:\n  Question: \"Did Mr. Carlson's choice cause the death? (Majority of people)\"\n  Scenario: Both dish choices contained wine; outcome was inevitable.\n  Reasoning: People are split: some blame the choice, others see inevitability.\n  Final Answer: <answer>Ambiguous</answer>\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Always answer the question as asked. If it says \"sufficient cause,\" evaluate sufficiency, not general causality.\n- For human judgment, consider classic pitfalls: omissions without duty are not causal, preempted causes are not causal, and overdetermined causes may be ambiguous.\n- If the question does not specify a perspective, default to \"majority of people.\"\n\nFinal output with only: <answer>Yes</answer>, <answer>No</answer>, or <answer>Ambiguous</answer>.",

Your task is to analyze scenarios and determine whether the described action caused the outcome, based on what the majority of people would conclude. Follow this structured reasoning framework meticulously.\n\n### Reasoning Framework:\n0.  **Parse the Question:** First, identify exactly what is being asked. Note if the question specifically mentions \"necessary cause,\" \"sufficient cause,\" or just \"cause.\" If it asks about sufficiency or necessity, focus your analysis primarily on that concept.\n\n1.  **Identify the Action and Outcome:** Clearly state the specific action (or omission) and the outcome in question.\n\n2.  **Apply Literal Constraints:** Interpret all given information exactly as stated. Pay close attention to defining phrases like \"only if,\" \"prevents,\" \"duty,\" or \"responsibility.\"\n\n3.  **Counterfactual Necessity Test (The Primary Test):**\n    - Ask: \"Would the outcome have occurred if the action had *not* been performed?\"\n    - If the answer is definitively *no*, then the action is a necessary cause. This is the strongest indicator of causality.\n    - **Hierarchy Rule:** A clear result from this test should be your primary guide. Normative factors can modify the strength of attribution but should not outright override a clear necessity judgment.\n\n4.  **Sufficiency Test:**\n    - Ask: \"Does the action, by itself and in isolation, guarantee the outcome will occur?\"\n    - If the question is specifically about a \"sufficient cause,\" a \"yes\" answer here means the action is sufficient, regardless of whether other sufficient causes exist.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Normative Factors:**\n    - **For Omissions:** Determine if the agent had a clear duty or responsibility to act. If no duty exists, people are very unlikely to view the omission as causal.\n    - **For Overdetermination:**\n        - *Multiple Sufficient Causes (the outcome would have happened anyway):* The action is not necessary. People may still attribute causality if the action is salient, active, or a norm violation.\n        - *Multiple Necessary Causes (the outcome required multiple actions):* Judgments are often split. People are more likely to attribute causality to an agent who violated a norm or acted abnormally. If causes are symmetric (equally necessary and salient), expect ambiguity.\n    - **Intent & Knowledge:** An agent acting without knowledge or intent is less likely to be seen as a cause, but this does not negate a clear causal role established by the counterfactual test.\n\n6.  **Assess Salience and Recency:** People attribute causality to the most recent change, an active intervention (vs. a passive omission), or a clear violation of normal procedures.\n\n7.  **Resolve Ambiguities:** Prefer interpretations consistent with the scenario's context and common sense. Clearly distinguish between an *action* and a related *omission*; judge the causal role of each separately based on the question asked.\n\n8.  **Simulate Human Judgment & Final Decision:**\n    - People are more likely to say \"Yes\" if the action was necessary, the agent was responsible, or the action was a salient, abnormal change.\n    - People are more likely to say \"No\" for omissions without duty, or if the outcome was overdetermined (would have happened anyway).\n    - **Crucially, if the scenario is a known case from psychological studies where judgments are split (e.g., causal omissions, symmetric overdetermination), or if the necessity test and normative factors point strongly in opposite directions, the answer is \"Ambiguous.\"**\n\n### Examples for Guidance (Including Common Pitfalls):\n\n-   **Example 1 (Redundant Cause - Omission without Duty):**\n    Scenario: David’s clothes dry if either MAX DRY OR HIGH TEMP is set. Both are set; he does not change TEMP.\n    Question: Did not changing the temperature cause drying?\n    Reasoning: The omission is not necessary (MAX DRY suffices). No duty to change a correct setting.\n    Majority Answer: No\n\n-   **Example 2 (Ambiguous Omission - Known Split Judgment):**\n    Scenario: *[The David dryer scenario from Example 5]*.\n    Question: Did David's clothes dry because David did not change the temperature setting?\n    Reasoning: While the omission is not necessary, the act of checking and deciding not to act makes some people attribute causality. This is a known case of split judgment.\n    Majority Answer: Ambiguous\n\n-   **Example 3 (Symmetric Overdetermination - Ambiguous):**\n    Scenario: Two permitted workers must press buttons simultaneously to start a process. Both press their buttons at the same time, starting the process.\n    Question: Did Worker A pressing the button cause the process to start?\n    Reasoning: Both actions are equally necessary and norm-conforming. Judgments are often split.\n    Majority Answer: Ambiguous\n\n-   **Example 4 (Norm-Violating Necessary Cause):**\n    Scenario: Jim (not allowed) and Carol (allowed) turn on lamps simultaneously, overloading the circuit.\n    Question: Did Jim turning on his lamp cause the failure?\n    Reasoning: Jim's action was necessary *and* a norm violation. This strengthens causal attribution despite the presence of another necessary cause (Carol).\n    Majority Answer: Yes\n\n-   **Example 5 (Ignorant Agent - Cause vs. Blame):**\n    Scenario: *[The Benni scenario from Example 1]*.\n    Question: Did Benni cause the plant to dry out?\n    Reasoning: Benni's action (applying B Y33R) was the necessary, abnormal component that combined with the normal background action (Alex applying A X200R) to cause harm. Lack of knowledge affects blame, not necessarily causal attribution.\n    Majority Answer: Yes\n\nFinal answer with only: <answer>Yes</answer>, <answer>No</answer>, or <answer>Ambiguous</answer>.",

Your task is to analyze scenarios and determine the correct causal judgment based on the specific question's framing.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Requested Judgment Type\nFirst, determine what kind of answer is required:\n- **Logical Judgment:** The question asks for a logician's perspective (e.g., \"Reply based on the answer a logician would give\"). Use strict, literal definitions.\n- **Popular Judgment:** The question asks for a majority opinion (e.g., \"Reply based on the answer the majority of people would give\"). Simulate common-sense human reasoning.\n- **Ambiguous:** If the question does not specify, or if logical and popular judgments would clearly conflict, default to popular judgment unless otherwise indicated.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Appropriate Reasoning Framework\n\n**A. For Logical Judgments (Logician's Perspective):**\n- Use strict definitions of necessity and sufficiency.\n  - **Necessary Cause:** The outcome would not have occurred without the action. Apply counterfactual reasoning: \"But for this action, would the outcome have happened?\"\n  - **Sufficient Cause:** The action alone guarantees the outcome in all contexts. Ask: \"If the action occurs, must the outcome always follow?\"\n- Be hyper-literal. Consider all possibilities, even unlikely ones (e.g., an action could be followed by another event that alters the outcome).

Reply as a logician.\nAnalysis: Classify as logical. A sufficient cause must guarantee the outcome in all contexts. While catching prevents the immediate fall, it does not guarantee Sam won't drop it afterward. The literal action of \"catching\" does not imply permanent securing. Thus, it is not sufficient.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example: Popular Judgment]\nQuestion: Did long-term exposure to asbestos cause John's premature death?

Your task is to analyze scenarios and determine the correct causal judgment based on the specific question's framing.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Requested Judgment Type\nFirst, determine what kind of answer is required:\n- **Logical Judgment:** The question asks for a logician's perspective (e.g., \"Reply based on the answer a logician would give\"). Use strict, literal definitions.\n- **Popular Judgment:** The question asks for a majority opinion (e.g., \"Reply based on the answer the majority of people would give\"). Simulate common-sense human reasoning.\n- **Ambiguous:** If the question does not specify, or if logical and popular judgments would clearly conflict, default to popular judgment unless otherwise indicated.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Appropriate Reasoning Framework\n\n**A. For Logical Judgments (Logician's Perspective):**\n- Use strict definitions of necessity and sufficiency.\n  - **Necessary Cause:** The outcome would not have occurred without the action. Apply counterfactual reasoning: \"But for this action, would the outcome have happened?\"\n  - **Sufficient Cause:** The action alone guarantees the outcome in all contexts.

Focus on the most salient link, not necessarily the first or last.\n- For deceived or ignorant agents, people may assign less causation if the agent had no reason to know their action was harmful.\n\n**C. For Ambiguous Cases:**\n- If the scenario is missing key information, or if people would be split roughly 50-50 between Yes and No (or between multiple causes), answer \"Ambiguous.\"\n- If there are multiple causes and people might disagree on which is primary, answer \"Ambiguous.\"\n\n### Step 3: Structured Reasoning Process\nFollow these steps for every analysis:\n1.  **Classify:** Identify the judgment type (logical or popular).\n2.  **Parse Scenario:** Extract key facts, actions, and outcomes.

Janet forgets to oil a machine. Kate notices this but does nothing. The machine breaks down. Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down? Reply based on majority opinion.\nAnalysis: Classify as popular. Kate knew about the problem and could have easily acted to prevent it. Even without formal responsibility, most people would see her omission as causal because she had knowledge and capacity to prevent harm.\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n\n[Example: Popular Judgment - Multiple Necessary Causes]\nQuestion: A machine shorts only if both the black wire and red wire touch the battery. The black wire is supposed to touch; the red wire is not. Both touch at the same time. Did the black wire cause the short circuit? Reply based on majority opinion.\nAnalysis: Classify as popular. Both wires are equally necessary for the short circuit. While the red wire's action was abnormal, the black wire's contribution was essential. People might be split: some would blame the abnormal red wire, others would say both caused it. This creates ambiguity about attributing causation specifically to the black wire.\n<answer>Ambiguous</answer>\n\n[Example: Popular Judgment - Deception]\nQuestion: Alex tricks Benni into applying harmful fertilizer.

The mixture does not explode. Is Sam not adding Reagent X to the mixture a sufficient cause for mixture not exploding? Reply based on the answer a logician would give.\nAnalysis: Classify as logical. A sufficient cause must guarantee the outcome in the given context. Here, Bob's addition of Reagent Y alone prevents the explosion. Even if Sam had added Reagent X, the mixture would not explode. Therefore, Sam's inaction is not sufficient for the non-explosion.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n[Example: Popular Judgment - Omission with Knowledge]\nQuestion: Janet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Kate noticed that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?  Reply Yes or No based on the answer the majority of people would give.\nAnalysis: Classify as popular. Janet had the duty and failed. Kate had no duty, but she knew about the problem and could have acted. People might disagree: some would blame Kate for not helping, while others would blame only Janet. Since there is no clear majority, it is ambiguous.\n<answer>Ambiguous</answer>\n\n[Example: Popular Judgment - Preemption]\nQuestion: Mr. Wallace is highly influential in the organized crime scene. Although he commands the respect of many, there are also a number of people who stand to benefit from his death. Today, he was having lunch with one of his associates, Mr. Vincent. At one point during their meeting, Mr. Wallace left the table to go to the toilet. While he was gone, Mr. Vincent managed to slip a lethal dose of poison into his martini. The poison is known to take one hour (give or take 10 minutes, depending on the victim's body weight) to kill and would go unnoticed for the first half hour after consumption. When Mr. Wallace returned to the table, he finished his lunch and then drank the rest of his martini. The two men concluded their meeting a few minutes later. Mr. Wallace paid the bill and they both left the restaurant going in different directions. Mr. Wallace had another important business meeting about 15 minutes away in a remote part of the countryside. On an isolated stretch of road, he noticed that he was suddenly being followed by a van that had pulled out from the roadside. The van accelerated and began hitting his car from behind. Mr. Wallace recognized that the driver was Mr. Bruce, an associate of one of Mr. Wallace's rivals. He tried to evade the van but there was no time. The van relentlessly hit his car and pushed it off the side where it fell into a ravine and exploded. The remains of Mr. Wallace's body were discovered later that day. The chief coroner's report later revealed that Mr. Wallace had received fatal burns in the car explosion. The report also indicated, however, that a lethal dose of poison was found in Mr. Wallace's blood. Did the poison cause Mr. Wallace's death?  Reply Yes or No based on the answer the majority of people would give.\nAnalysis: Classify as popular. The explosion was the proximate cause of death. However, the poison was lethal and would have killed him shortly. People might focus on the explosion as the actual cause, but some might consider the poison as the initiating cause. Since opinions could be split, it is ambiguous.\n<answer>Ambiguous</answer>\n\n[Example: Popular Judgment - Normal Omission]\nQuestion: David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is set on HIGH. He does not change the setting at all, and he leaves the temperature set to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David did not change the temperature setting?  Reply Yes or No based on the answer the majority of people would give.\nAnalysis: Classify as popular. The temperature was already HIGH, so not changing it was the normal, expected behavior. The drying happened because the settings were correct. People would not see David's inaction as a cause; they would attribute it to the existing settings. Thus, the answer is no.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n### Final Answer Format:\nAfter your reasoning, output only one of the following on its own line:\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n<answer>No</answer>\n<answer>Ambiguous</answer>",

Abnormal actions are more salient in judgments of *blame*, but not always in *causation*. Do not confuse causation with blame.\n8.  **Synthesize for Majority View:** Based on steps 2-7, determine what most people would conclude.

The cause is Janet's omission. Majority answer: **No**.\n*   **Example B (Pre-emption & Contrast):** \"Did the relocation cause John's *premature* death?\" The relocation led to cancer, meaning John was in the hospital where a nurse error killed him. Without the relocation, he would not have died *at that moment*. The relocation is a cause of his premature death. Majority answer: **Yes**.\n*   **Example C (Sufficiency vs. Necessity):** \"Is Sam catching the test tube a *sufficient* cause?\" The question is about sufficiency, not necessity. Sam's action was sufficient to prevent contamination, even if it wasn't necessary due to the mattress. A logician's answer: **Yes**.\n*   **Example D (Overdetermination):** \"David did not change the temperature setting.\" The outcome was overdetermined (both settings were sufficient). His inaction ensured one sufficient condition remained true, so it is a difference-making part of the actual cause.

Crucially, note if the \"action\" is an *omission* (a failure to act) or a *commission* (an active deed).

Were they aware of the relevant rules?\n    -   **Normality:** Was the action a deviation from normal, expected, or prescribed behavior?\n    -   **Duty:** Did the actor have a **specific duty** to prevent the outcome or to avoid the action? **This is often the deciding factor.**\n6.  **Synthesize for Majority View:** Based on all steps, determine what most people would conclude. **Prioritize duty and normality over pure physical necessity.**\n    -   If the counterfactual test suggests causation but the action was normal and unintentional and violated no duty (e.g., someone following an old rule because they weren't told about a new one), people will likely say **No** and attribute cause to the person who created the abnormal situation.\n    -   In scenarios where any choice leads to harm (tragic dilemmas), people are reluctant to assign \"cause\" to the person making a reasonable choice to minimize overall harm. The cause is attributed to the situation itself.\n    -   When two actions are physically necessary, people assign cause to the one that violated a rule or duty.\n    -   If arguments for both sides are equally strong, choose **Ambiguous**.\n\n**Learn from Past Mistakes and Examples:**\n-   **Example 1 (Gardener):** Benni's action was physically necessary for the plant damage, but his action was *normal* (he used the old fertilizer) and he lacked *knowledge* and violated no *duty*. Alex's forgetfulness was the *abnormal*, duty-violating action. Majority answer: **No**, Benni did not cause the damage.\n-   **Example 2 (Driver Dilemma):** Jack's omission (not slowing down) was physically necessary for the climber's fall. However, he had a greater *duty* to his passengers, and his action was *normal* in this emergency triage situation. Majority answer: **No**, Jack did not cause the fall; the cause is the tragic situation.\n-   **Example 3 (Dryer):** David changing the temperature was physically unnecessary (overdetermination) because the MAX DRY setting was already sufficient. His action was *normal* and violated no *duty*. Majority answer: **No**, David did not cause the clothes to dry.\n-   **Example 4 (Factory - Kate unaware):** Kate's inaction was an omission. She had no *duty* to act (it wasn't her responsibility) and she lacked *knowledge* (she didn't notice). Janet's failure was the *abnormal*, duty-violating action. Majority answer: **No**, Kate did not cause the breakdown.\n-   **Example 5 (Circuit Breaker):** Both Jim and Carol's actions were physically necessary. However, Jim's action was *abnormal* and violated a stated rule (*duty*), while Carol's was normal and permitted. Majority answer: **Yes**, Jim caused the failure.\n\n**Final Answer Format:**\nAfter your reasoning, provide your final answer on its own line, formatted as: `<answer>Yes</answer>`, `<answer>No</answer>`, or `<answer>Ambiguous</answer>`.\n\n**Now, here is the question to answer:**\n[Insert New Question Here]",

                "prompt": "You are given a scenario about causality. Decide whether the action described caused the outcome. Your final answer must be **Yes**, **No**, or **Ambiguous**. **Crucially, your goal is to predict the answer the majority of people would give, which often incorporates notions of blame, responsibility, and norm violation, not just physical necessity.**\n\n**Reasoning Steps to Follow:**\n\n1.  **Precisely Define the Action and Outcome:** Identify the exact action in question and the specific, literal outcome described. Pay special attention to modifiers like \"premature\" in \"premature death\" – this changes the counterfactual.\n2.  **Identify the Causal Rule/Method:** Note any explicit rule (e.g., \"mixing chemicals causes damage\") or implicit method by which the action could lead to the outcome.\n3.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test (The Core Test):** Ask: \"If the action had **NOT** happened, would the **specific outcome** still have occurred exactly as it did?\"\n    -   If **No**, the action was a necessary cause (this supports **Yes**).\n    -   If **Yes**, the action was not necessary (this supports **No**).\n4.  **Check for Pre-emption (The Most Important Filter):** Was the outcome already guaranteed to happen by a prior cause? If yes, then an action that only changes the *timing* or *manner* of that pre-ordained outcome is **not** its cause. However, if the action itself *created* the pre-empting condition (e.g., caused the terminal illness), then it **is** the cause of the outcome (e.g., premature death).\n5.  **Evaluate Normality, Intent, and Knowledge (The Human Judgment Filter):**\n    -   **Normality:** Was the action a violation of a stated rule, a duty, or a deviation from normal, expected behavior? **People assign causality to the person who broke a norm. A normal action, even if physically necessary, is often not seen as 'the cause'.**\n    -   **Intent & Knowledge:** Did the actor intend the outcome? Did they know their action could lead to it? Lack of intent/knowledge reduces blame but does not automatically negate causal contribution.\n6.  **Synthesize for Majority View Using a Decision Hierarchy:** Resolve any conflict between previous steps by applying these filters in order:\n    -   **A. Pre-emption Trumps Everything:** If the outcome was inevitable and the action only changed its timing/manner → **No**.\n    -   **B. Abnormal Cause Filter:** If multiple actions are physically necessary, the **abnormal** (norm-violating) action is seen as the cause. The normal action is not.\n    -   **C. Directness Filter:** If multiple abnormal actions exist, the most **direct** cause is selected.\n    -   If the scenario is perfectly balanced after these filters, choose **Ambiguous**.\n\n**Learn from These Examples to Avoid Past Mistakes:**\n\n-   **Example 1 (The Gardener):** Alex forgot to tell Benni a new rule. Benni used the old fertilizer, which was physically necessary for the plant damage. However, Benni's action was *normal* (he used the old fertilizer) and he lacked *knowledge*. Alex's forgetfulness was the *abnormal*, norm-violating action. Therefore, the majority answer is **No**, Benni did not cause the damage.\n-   **Example 2 (The Computer):** Claire and Daniel both logged on, which was physically necessary for the crash. However, Daniel's action was *abnormal* (he violated a direct warning). Claire's action was *normal* (using her own computer). Therefore, the majority blames Daniel and answers **No**, Claire did not cause the crash.\n-   **Example 3 (Benni's Fertilizer):** Benni's use of B Y33R was physically necessary for the plants to dry out. Even though he lacked knowledge and acted normally, his action was still part of the causal recipe. The majority would say he *caused* the damage in a physical sense (Answer: **Yes**), while assigning *blame* to Alex for the failure to communicate.\n-   **Example 4 (Nurse's Error):** John was going to die from cancer in 2 months. The nurse's error caused his death at that moment instead. However, since the outcome (death) was already inevitable, the error only changed the timing. It did **not** cause his *premature death* (Answer: **No**), as his death was already imminent and guaranteed.\n-   **Example 5 (Relocation):** The relocation led to asbestos exposure, which caused John's terminal cancer. This made his premature death inevitable. The nurse's error only changed the manner of that already-inevitable death. Therefore, the relocation is the cause of the premature death (Answer: **Yes**).\n\n**Final Answer Format:**\nAfter your reasoning, provide your final answer on its own line, formatted as: `<answer>Yes</answer>`, `<answer>No</answer>`, or `<answer>Ambiguous</answer>`.\n\n**Now, here is the question to answer:**\n[Insert New Question Here]",

Your answer should reflect what the majority of people would conclude based on everyday notions of causality and responsibility, prioritizing blameworthiness and fault over mere physical necessity.\n\n**Reasoning Steps (Follow in Order):**\n\n1.  **But-for Test (Necessary Condition):** First, consider whether the outcome would have occurred without the action. If not, this suggests the action is a cause-in-fact. Proceed to step 2. If yes, the action is likely not a cause, and you can answer **No**.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Normality and Fault (Proximate Cause):** This is the most critical step. Determine if the action was:\n    *   **Faulty:** A deviation from plans, a mistake, intentional misconduct, or a violation of instructions/duty.\n    *   **Normal:** Non-faulty, following instructions, or performed without knowledge of its harmfulness (e.g., due to deception).\n    *   **An Omission:** A failure to act. Only consider this a cause if the person had a clear duty to act.\n\n    **Guideline:** An action is far more likely to be considered *the* cause if it was faulty. An action that is a necessary condition but was normal (non-faulty) is typically **not** considered the cause by most people; the cause is assigned to whoever created the faulty situation (e.g., a deceiver).\n\n3.  **Check for Pre-emption or Overdetermination:** Was the outcome guaranteed to happen anyway by another sufficient cause? Was the action redundant? If yes, the action is not considered a cause. If two faulty actions were simultaneously necessary, causation may be shared or ambiguous.\n\n4.  **Synthesize for Final Judgment:** Combine the steps above. A necessary condition (Step 1) is only considered a cause if it was also faulty (Step 2) and not pre-empted (Step 3). The primary cause is the most blameworthy, abnormal action in the chain.\n\n**Crucial Examples to Guide Your Reasoning:**\n*   **Deception:** If Person A lies to Person B, causing Person B to perform a necessary action, Person B's action is **not** the cause; Person A's deception is. (e.g., A gardener deceived into using the wrong fertilizer is not the cause of the plants dying).\n*   **Omissions & Duty:** An omission is a cause **only** if the person had a duty to act (e.g., an employee responsible for oiling a machine). An omission by someone with no duty is not a cause.\n*   **Redundant Actions:** An action that pre-empts another sufficient cause (e.g., catching an object that would have landed safely) is **not** a sufficient cause of the outcome.\n*   **Simultaneous Fault:** If two people perform faulty actions that are jointly necessary for an outcome, causation is often **Ambiguous**. If one action is faulty and the other is normal, the faulty action is typically considered the cause.\n\nAfter your reasoning, finalize your answer with `Yes`, `No`, or `Ambiguous`.\n\n**Question:**\n{Question}",

Your answer should reflect what the majority of people would conclude based on everyday notions of causality and responsibility.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify Deviant Actions and Duties:** First, identify if any action was a **deviation from norms, instructions, or expectations** or a **breach of a duty**. The majority of people are much more likely to identify a *deviant* action or a *failure to fulfill a duty* as \"the cause,\" even if other factors were necessary. A normal, non-deviant, non-faulty action is rarely called \"the cause\" on its own.\n\n2.  **But-for Test (Necessity):** Consider whether the outcome would have occurred *when and how it did* if the specified action had not happened (or, for an omission, if the action had been taken). A positive answer suggests the action might be a cause. **Crucial: A positive but-for test is frequently OVERRULED by the principles of Normality and Deviance. Do not conclude \"Yes\" based on but-for alone if the action was normal and another action was deviant.**\n\n3.  **Normality, Defaults, and Fault:** An action is much less likely to be considered a cause if it was normal, non-faulty, followed instructions, or constituted a **default or expected state of affairs.** It is more likely to be considered a cause if it was a **change from the status quo,** a deviation from plans, a mistake, or intentional misconduct.\n\n4.  **Proximity and Directness:** Evaluate how directly the action led to the outcome.

If the actions are asymmetrical (e.g., one was normal and one was deviant), people will primarily assign causation to the deviant action.**\n    -   **Pre-emption of Defaults:** If an outcome requires a normal, expected action (or state) and a deviant, unexpected action, the deviant action is considered the cause. The normal action is seen as a background condition that was \"pre-empted\" and is not typically considered *a* cause in everyday language.\n\n**Key Examples to Guide Your Reasoning:**\n-   **Example A (Symmetrical Actions):** Two authorized people perform identical normal actions simultaneously, causing an outcome. Neither person's action is typically considered *the* cause; the cause is the simultaneous action. *-> Often \"No\" for each individual.*\n-   **Example B (Deviant Action):** A person follows incorrect instructions due to another's deception.

A person's omission (e.g., not changing that setting) is not a cause. *-> \"No\".*\n-   **Example D (Default vs. Intervention):** A person is engaged in a normal, expected activity (e.g., Claire using her computer). Another person performs a deviant intervention (e.g., Daniel logging in against warnings). The deviant intervention is seen as the cause of the resulting problem, not the normal activity. *-> \"No\" for the person doing the normal activity.*\n-   **Example E (Deviant Omission vs. Normal Action):** A person (Alex) is instructed to perform a normal action (fertilize with A X200R) *and* to inform a colleague (Benni) of a new rule. The person performs the normal action correctly but forgets to inform the colleague. The colleague, unaware, performs a different but also normal action (using B Y33R). The combination causes harm. The majority would **not** say the normal *action* (fertilizing) was the cause. The deviant *omission* (forgetting to inform) may be blamed, but the question asks about the action. *-> \"No\".*\n\n**Final Decision:**\nWeigh all steps. **The principles of Deviance and Normality are typically the most powerful in determining common-sense judgment.** The goal is to mirror common sense, not just formal logic.

Your answer should reflect what the majority of people would conclude based on everyday notions of causality and responsibility.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Essential Requirement (But-for Test):** First and foremost, ask: \"Would the outcome have occurred **at the specific time and in the specific way it did** if the action had **not** happened?\"\n    *   If **No**, then the action is a **cause**. Proceed to step 2 to check for any reasons people might be *reluctant* to assign causation despite this.\n    *   If **Yes**, the action is **not a cause**. (Stop here. Example: Not changing a redundant setting when the outcome was guaranteed by another factor).\n\n2.  **Assigning Salience:** If the action passes the But-for test, people are more likely to call it \"a cause\" and assign responsibility if it was:\n    *   **Faulty:** A mistake, misconduct, or a deviation from instructions/plans.\n    *   **Intentional:** Done on purpose to bring about the outcome.\n    *   **Proximate:** The most direct and immediate event in the chain, not a distant background condition.\n    *   **An Action:** People are more likely to attribute causation to actions than to omissions, unless the omission violated a clear duty to act.\n    If the action was normal, non-faulty, and a distant background condition, people may be reluctant to call it \"the cause,\" but it remains *a* cause.\n\n**Final Decision Framework:**\n*   If the action **fails the But-for test**, answer `No`.\n*   If the action **passes the But-for test**, answer `Yes`, unless it was a **normal, non-faulty, distant background action or omission without a clear duty**. In these rare cases, answer `Ambiguous`.\n*   If two or more actions are equally but-for causes and the scenario does not clearly make one more salient (faulty, intentional, proximate), answer `Ambiguous`.\n\n**Important Examples to Consider:**\n- **Redundant Cause:** If a person does not change a setting, but the outcome would have happened anyway due to another condition, their inaction is `No`t a cause.\n- **Normal vs. Faulty Action:** If a person buys an item normally (like a bookend) and this completes a pair only because another person stole a matching item, the purchase is a but-for cause. However, because the theft is faulty and salient, the majority would say the thief caused the possession of the pair, not the purchaser. The answer for the purchaser is `No`.\n- **Multiple Causes:** If two gardeners each apply a different chemical, and the combination causes harm, both are but-for causes. If neither acted faultily in the application itself (e.g., one just forgot to relay a rule), causation is shared and the answer for each is `Yes`.\n- **Pre-Existing Condition:** If a terminal illness guarantees death, and a medical error only changes the timing by a short period, the illness is the cause of the premature death (`Yes`), while the error is the cause of the immediate death.\n\n**Question:**\n{Question}\n\nAfter your reasoning, finalize your answer with `Yes`, `No`, or `Ambiguous`.",

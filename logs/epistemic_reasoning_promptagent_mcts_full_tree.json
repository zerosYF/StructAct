Follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the core event:** Locate the main fact or event described in the hypothesis.\n2.  **Locate the belief holder:** Identify who, in the premise, holds a belief about this event.\n3.  **Apply the belief rule:** If the premise states that a person *believes*, *thinks*, or *knows* a complex proposition, then that person also believes the sub-propositions that make up the complex proposition. This is entailment.\n4.  **Avoid external assumptions:** Base your judgment solely on the information given. Do not invent scenarios, doubts, or possibilities not present in the text.\n\n**Example of Correct Reasoning:**\nPremise: Taylor thinks that Michael recognizes that a fighter jet is landed outside.\nHypothesis: Taylor thinks that a fighter jet is landed outside.\nReasoning: The premise states Taylor believes a complex proposition (\"Michael recognizes that X\"). Therefore, Taylor believes the sub-proposition (\"X\"). This is entailment.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Example of Incorrect Reasoning (to avoid):**\nPremise: Taylor thinks that Michael recognizes that a fighter jet is landed outside.\nHypothesis: Taylor thinks that a fighter jet is landed outside.\nReasoning: Taylor might think Michael is mistaken, so she may not believe it herself.

Remember that a non-factive verb does not commit the agent to the truth of its embedded clause.\n\n4.  **Check for logical entailment:** The premise entails the hypothesis if, given the speaker's commitments (from step 2) and the stated agent beliefs (from step 3), the truth of the hypothesis is logically guaranteed.

The premise states Taylor thinks that Michael recognizes P. Since Taylor attributes a state of knowledge (which requires P) to Michael, she must herself believe P.

The premise states Taylor suspects that David knows P. If the speaker commits to P being true, and Taylor suspects that David knows this true fact, then Taylor must suspect that P is true. Entailment holds.\nOutput: `entailment`\n\n**Example 3 (Non-Entailment):**\nPremise: Chris believes that Emma thinks a treaty was signed.\nHypothesis: Chris believes a treaty was signed.\nReasoning: Both \"believes\" and \"thinks\" are non-factive.

Identify any logical operators like `AND` or `OR`.\n    *   **Key Rule for AND:** If a belief, suspicion, or other attitude is held toward a conjunction (A AND B), this **entails** that the same attitude is held toward each individual conjunct. This is a fundamental rule of belief attribution.\n\n3.  **Analyze Belief Embedding and Presupposition:**\n    *   Map out \"who believes what.\" For a structure like \"A VERB1 that B VERB2 that P\":\n        *   Determine what Agent A's attitude is towards the proposition \"B VERB2 that P\".\n        *   If VERB1 is **factive**, the premise asserts the truth of \"B VERB2 that P\".\n        *   If VERB1 is **non-factive**, the premise only states that A holds that belief; \"B VERB2 that P\" may not be true.\n    *   If VERB2 is **factive**, then for anyone to believe that Agent B holds that attitude (e.g., \"A thinks B knows P\"), they must themselves presuppose that P is true.\n\n4.  **Check for Entailment:**\n    *   The premise entails the hypothesis if the analysis shows that the truth of the premise **guarantees** the truth of the hypothesis in all possible scenarios.\n    *   Use the rules from steps 2 and 3. Does the premise's structure logically force the hypothesis to be true?\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n\n**Example 1 (Conjunction in a Belief):**\nPremise: Abigail suspects that a woman is walking her dog and using her cellphone.\nHypothesis: Abigail suspects that the woman is using her cellphone.\nReasoning: \"Suspects\" is non-factive, so the events may not be true. However, the premise attributes a suspicion of a conjunction to Abigail. Believing or suspecting a conjunction (A and B) logically entails believing or suspecting each conjunct (A) and (B). Therefore, the premise guarantees the hypothesis.\nOutput: `entailment`\n\n**Example 2 (Factive Belief Attribution):**\nPremise: Thomas sees that Richard believes that a man is smiling.\nHypothesis: Richard believes that a man is smiling.\nReasoning: \"Sees that\" is factive; it presupposes the truth of its complement clause \"Richard believes that...\". Therefore, the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis.\nOutput: `entailment`\n\n**Example 3 (Non-Factive Belief Attribution):**\nPremise: Thomas thinks that Richard believes that a man is smiling.\nHypothesis: Richard believes that a man is smiling.\nReasoning: \"Thinks\" is non-factive. The premise only states Thomas's belief about Richard's belief; Richard might not actually hold that belief. The premise does not guarantee the hypothesis.\nOutput: `non-entailment`\n\n**Example 4 (Factive under Belief):**\nPremise: Taylor thinks that Michael recognizes that a fighter jet is landed outside.\nHypothesis: Taylor thinks that a fighter jet is landed outside.\nReasoning: \"Recognizes\" is factive. For Taylor to think that Michael recognizes P, Taylor must herself believe that P is true. Therefore, the premise guarantees the hypothesis.\nOutput: `entailment`\n\nFinally, output only `entailment` or `non-entailment`.",

Your analysis must be based ONLY on the information provided in the Premise.\n2.  **Ignore Real-World Knowledge**: Do not evaluate whether the statements are true in reality. Consider only the world as described by the Premise.\n3.  **Evaluate Beliefs from the Text's Perspective**: If the Premise states that a person believes something, then within this context, it is a fact that they hold that belief. Your task is to determine if the Hypothesis follows from these stated facts.\n\n### Example ###\nPremise: Abigail believes that John learns that two people in coats kiss on the side of a road.\nHypothesis: Abigail believes that two people in coats kiss on the side of a road.\nReasoning: The Premise establishes it as a fact that Abigail holds the belief \"John learns that two people kiss.\" Therefore, the Hypothesis, which states she holds the belief \"two people kiss,\" is directly supported by the Premise.

Entailment occurs only if the Hypothesis must logically be true in every reasonable scenario where the Premise is true. If the Hypothesis could be false without contradicting the Premise, choose non-entailment.\n\n### Reasoning Guidelines:\n- **Use pragmatic inference:** Consider what is typically implied in real-world contexts. For example, in a laundromat, a person interacting with a basket near a dryer is generally assumed to be handling their own laundry.\n- **Avoid literal-mindedness:** Synonyms, paraphrases, or contextually implied details (like possession) should not be treated as new information if they are reasonable inferences.\n- **Ignore unlikely scenarios:** If the only way the Hypothesis could be false is through a far-fetched or irrational situation, this still counts as entailment.\n\n### Example:\nPremise: Isabella knows that a man is in front of a dryer in a laundromat with both hands reaching into a bin or basket.  \nHypothesis: Isabella knows that a man reaches into his laundry basket at the laundromat.  \nAnalysis: The basket is contextually his own—assuming otherwise is unrealistic.

According to Rule B, this does not mean Robert himself believes `P` is true.\nAnswer: non-entailment\n\n**Example 3 (Entailment - Factive Verb):**\nPremise: Anna knows that the meeting is canceled.\nHypothesis: The meeting is canceled.\nReasoning: \"Knows\" is a factive verb (Rule C). It entails the truth of its complement `P`.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Example of Incorrect Reasoning (to avoid):**\nPremise: Robert thinks that David assumes that a young girl is standing in a kitchen.\nHypothesis: Robert thinks that a young girl is standing in a kitchen.\nIncorrect Reasoning: If Robert thinks David assumes P, then Robert must also believe P. (This violates Rule B by inventing a logical connection not present in the premise).\nCorrect Answer: non-entailment\n\nNow, analyze the provided input.\nPremise: {premise}\nHypothesis: {hypothesis}\nReasoning:",

Follow these reasoning steps carefully:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Proposition:** Locate the main fact or event described in the hypothesis.\n2.  **Map the Belief Structure:** Identify all individuals and the specific mental state verbs (e.g., *believes, knows, suspects, thinks*) applied to them in the premise.\n3.  **Classify the Verbs:**\n    *   **Factive Verbs (e.g., *knows, realizes, recognizes*):** These presuppose the truth of their complement. If a person holds a belief that involves someone else knowing a fact, then the believer also accepts that fact as true.\n    *   **Non-Factive Verbs (e.g., *believes, thinks, suspects*):** These do **not** presuppose the truth of their complement. Believing that someone else *believes* or *suspects* something does **not** mean you believe that thing yourself.\n4.  **Evaluate the Chain:** For the hypothesis to be entailed, the final proposition must be believed directly by the main belief holder or be the complement of a **factive verb** in the belief chain. A chain consisting only of non-factive verbs (e.g., \"A believes that B suspects that X\") does **NOT** entail that the main belief holder believes X.\n5.  **Strictly Avoid Assumptions:** Your judgment must be based solely on the linguistic rules above. Do not infer doubts, mistakes, or truths that are not explicitly supported by the verb types in the premise.\n\n**Crucial Examples to Guide Reasoning:**\n\n**Example 1 (Entailment - Factive Verb):**\nPremise: Taylor thinks that Michael **recognizes** that a fighter jet is landed outside.\nHypothesis: Taylor thinks that a fighter jet is landed outside.\nReasoning: The verb \"recognizes\" is factive. Taylor's belief that Michael recognizes X entails that Taylor also accepts X as true.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Example 2 (Non-Entailment - Non-Factive Verb):**\nPremise: Olivia believes that Joseph **suspects** that a road crew is working.\nHypothesis: Olivia believes that a road crew is working.\nReasoning: The verb \"suspects\" is non-factive. Olivia's belief about Joseph's suspicion does not mean Olivia herself believes the content of that suspicion. The chain \"believes that...suspects\" fails to entail the final proposition.\nAnswer: non-entailment\n\n**Example 3 (Non-Entailment - Incomplete Belief):**\nPremise: John believes that Richard suspects that a man has a painted face.\nHypothesis: John believes that a man has a painted face.\nReasoning: The chain is \"believes that...suspects\". Both verbs are non-factive. John only believes that Richard has a suspicion, not that the suspicion is correct.

Parse the Premise to identify all verbs and their nesting (e.g., \"A thinks that B remembers that C\").\n2. For each verb, classify it as Factive or Non-Factive.\n3. Apply the rules recursively from the innermost clause outward:\n   - A factive verb entails the truth of its complement.\n   - A non-factive verb does not entail the truth of its complement.\n4. Crucially: A belief about someone else's belief (e.g., \"A thinks that B believes P\") only provides information about A's mental state, not about the truth of P or even the certainty of B's belief.\n5. Determine if the Hypothesis is logically guaranteed by the Premise after this analysis.\n\nExamples to Avoid Common Mistakes:\n- **Example A (Factive):**\n  Premise: Olivia believes that Ava remembers that a young boy is kicking.\n  Hypothesis: Olivia believes that a young boy is kicking.\n  Reasoning: \"Remembers\" is factive; \"Ava remembers X\" entails X. Therefore, Olivia's belief in Ava's memory entails her belief in X. **Answer: entailment**\n\n- **Example B (Non-Factive):**\n  Premise: Thomas thinks that John assumes that a man is riding.\n  Hypothesis: John assumes that a man is riding.\n  Reasoning: \"Thinks\" is non-factive.

If a rational agent who believes P would also necessarily believe Q, then P entails Q.\n    - *Example:* P: \"a child eats chocolate cake with his fingers\" → Q: \"a child has chocolate on his hand\" → **Entailment** (commonsense cause/effect).\n    - If P does not entail Q, proceed to step 4.\n\n3.  **Handle Iterated Belief (`X [verb] that Y [verb] that P`):**\n    - This is the case if the embedded proposition P is itself a belief ascription (e.g., \"Y believes that P\").\n    - **Apply the Pragmatic Rule:** The Premise `X believes that Y [verb] that P` pragmatically entails `X believes that P` **IF AND ONLY IF** the embedded verb (`[verb]`) expresses a mental state that **COMMITS TO THE TRUTH OF P**.\n    - **Verbs that commit to truth:** Factive verbs (`knows`, `remembers`, `understands`, `realizes`) and the strong belief verb `believes`.\n    - **Verbs that do NOT commit to truth:** Verbs of uncertainty, desire, or falsehood (`suspects`, `doubts`, `hopes`, `dreams`, `imagines`).\n    - **If the rule applies:** Then you can infer `X believes that P`. If the Hypothesis is `X believes that P`, answer **entailment**.\n    - **If the rule does not apply:** Answer **non-entailment** for a hypothesis claiming `X believes that P`.\n\n4.  **Decide Entailment:** Synthesize the reasoning from the steps above. If the Hypothesis is entailed, answer \"entailment\". Otherwise, answer \"non-entailment\".\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n\n**Example 1 (Entailment via Commonsense):**\nPremise: Robert believes that a young blond child eats chocolate cake with his fingers.\nHypothesis: Robert believes that the child has chocolate on his hands.\nAnalysis: Single-layer belief. P entails Q via commonsense (eating messy food with fingers causes mess).\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Example 2 (Entailment via Pragmatic Rule):**\nPremise: David knows that Sarah believes the meeting is canceled.\nHypothesis: David believes the meeting is canceled.\nAnalysis: Iterated belief. Embedded verb \"believes\" commits to truth. Rule applies.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Example 3 (Non-Entailment - Single Belief):**\nPremise: Olivia believes that a man is wearing a blue hat.\nHypothesis: Olivia believes that a man is wearing a colorful hat.\nAnalysis: Single-layer belief. \"Blue\" does not logically entail \"colorful\" (it could be a dull blue). P does not entail Q.\nAnswer: non-entailment\n\n**Example 4 (Non-Entailment - Rule Does Not Apply):**\nPremise: Emma thinks that Mark dreams that aliens exist.\nHypothesis: Emma thinks that aliens exist.\nAnalysis: Iterated belief. Embedded verb \"dreams\" does not commit to truth. Rule does not apply.\nAnswer: non-entailment\n\n**Now, apply this reasoning to the current input.**",

Use pragmatic reasoning about belief ascription and logical entailment.\n\n**Follow these steps in order:**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Agent and Belief Content**\n- For both Premise and Hypothesis, identify the **agent** (the person whose belief is being described) and the **proposition P** (the content of their belief).\n- **Example:** In \"Thomas recognizes that two boys are present\", the agent is \"Thomas\" and P_premise is \"two boys are present\".\n\n**Step 2: Check for Direct Entailment of Belief Content**\n- **If the agents are the same:** The Premise entails the Hypothesis **IF AND ONLY IF** the proposition P_premise logically entails P_hypothesis.\n- **How to check:** Ask: \"If P_premise is true, must P_hypothesis also be true?\" Consider:\n    - Semantic equivalence (paraphrases, synonyms)\n    - Hyponymy (e.g., \"dog\" → \"animal\")\n    - Logical consequences (e.g., \"holding an accordion\" → \"holding an instrument\")\n    - Contextual implications based on common sense\n- **Factive Verbs:** If the Premise uses a factive verb (`knows`, `recognizes`, `realizes`, `is aware`), this means P_premise is true. However, for belief entailment, we only care about whether the *agent's belief* in P_premise entails their belief in P_hypothesis.\n- **If entailment is established here, proceed to Step 4.**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Nested Belief Ascriptions (Only if applicable)**\n- **Only apply this step if the Premise has two mental state verbs:** \"**Agent1** [verb1] that **Agent2** [verb2] that P\"\n- **Identify the verbs:**\n    - **Verb1** (matrix verb): e.g., \"thinks\", \"believes\", \"knows\"\n    - **Verb2** (embedded verb): e.g., \"knows\", \"believes\", \"suspects\"\n- **Apply the Pragmatic Rule:**\n    - The Premise entails \"**Agent1 believes that P**\" **IF AND ONLY IF**:\n        1.  **Verb1** is a cognitive ascription (e.g., `thinks`, `believes`, `knows`).\n        2.  **Verb2** expresses a mental state that **COMMITS TO THE TRUTH OF P**.\n    - **Verbs that commit to truth:** Factive verbs (`knows`, `remembers`, `understands`, `realizes`) and the strong belief verb `believes`.\n    - **Verbs that do NOT commit to truth:** Express uncertainty, desire, or falsehood (e.g., `suspects`, `doubts`, `hopes`, `dreams`, `imagines`).\n\n**Step 4: Decide Entailment**\n- If the Hypothesis is entailed (via Step 2 or Step 3), answer \"entailment\".\n- Otherwise, answer \"non-entailment\".\n\n**Critical Examples for Guidance (Pay Close Attention):**\n\n**Example A (Entailment via Belief Content):**\nPremise: Thomas recognizes that a boy in a green shirt is surrounded by toys and another boy is to his left.\nHypothesis: Thomas believes that two boys are present.\nAnalysis: (Step 2) Same agent (Thomas). P_premise (a detailed description of two boys) logically entails P_hypothesis (\"two boys are present\"). Therefore, entailment holds.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Example B (Entailment via Factivity):**\nPremise: Abigail knows that Joseph thinks that a boy is pushing a girl.\nHypothesis: Joseph thinks that a boy is pushing a girl.\nAnalysis: (Step 2) The matrix verb \"knows\" is factive. Therefore, the content of Abigail's belief (\"Joseph thinks that a boy is pushing a girl\") is true. This directly matches the Hypothesis.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Example C (Entailment via Pragmatic Rule):**\nPremise: David knows that Sarah believes the meeting is canceled.\nHypothesis: David believes the meeting is canceled.\nAnalysis: (Step 3) Structure: \"Agent1 (David) [knows] that Agent2 (Sarah) [believes] that P\". The embedded verb \"believes\" commits to truth. The rule applies.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Example D (Non-Entailment - Belief Content Mismatch):**\nPremise: Joseph believes that a man in a gray sweatshirt is using a power saw in a garage.\nHypothesis: Joseph believes that a man in a gray sweatshirt is using a power saw in a kitchen.\nAnalysis: (Step 2) Same agent (Joseph). P_premise (\"in a garage\") does NOT entail P_hypothesis (\"in a kitchen\"); these are different locations. Entailment fails.\nAnswer: non-entailment\n\n**Example E (Non-Entailment - Rule Does Not Apply):**\nPremise: Emma thinks that Mark dreams that aliens exist.\nHypothesis: Emma thinks that aliens exist.\nAnalysis: (Step 3) The embedded verb \"dreams\" does not commit to truth. The rule does not apply. No entailment via Step 2.\nAnswer: non-entailment\n\n**Now, apply this reasoning to the current input.**",

This is the neutral factual content.\n\n2.  **Check for Direct Entailment (Bypassing Belief Ascription):**\n    *   If the Hypothesis is **directly stated within the Premise** (e.g., Premise: \"X sees that **Y suspects Z**\", Hypothesis: \"**Y suspects Z**\"), then the answer is **entailment**.

For example, \"X knows that P\" entails \"P\".\n\n3.  **Apply the Pragmatic Belief Ascription Rule (ONLY if needed):**\n    *   This rule **ONLY** applies if the Premise has the structure: **\"X thinks/believes that Y [mental state verb] Z\"**.\n    *   **Rule:** If the verb describing Y's mental state is **factive** (`knows`, `remembers`) or the strong belief verb `believes`, then this pragmatically entails \"**X believes Z**\".

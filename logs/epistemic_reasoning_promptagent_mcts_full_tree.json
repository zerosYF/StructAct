The complement is only claimed to be part of a person's mental state.\n- **Inferences within Belief Contexts:** If a person has a belief that involves a factive statement, you can infer they believe the fact. (e.g., \"A believes that B **knows** X\" entails \"A believes that X is true\").\n- **Inferences about Belief Contexts:** A statement that \"Person A believes X\" **only** entails that A holds that belief. It does **not** entail that X is actually true in the world. (e.g., \"Emma believes Taylor assumes X\" **does not** entail \"Taylor assumes X\".

Therefore, believing \"David remembers X\" entails believing X is true.  \n  Answer: entailment\n\n- Example C:  \n  Premise: \"Emma believes that Taylor assumes that a cement worker is working on a new sidewalk outside of a clothing store.\"  \n  Hypothesis: \"Taylor assumes that a cement worker is working on a new sidewalk outside of a clothing store.\"  \n  Reasoning: The verb \"assumes\" is non-factive. The Premise only describes Emma's belief about Taylor's assumption. It does not establish that Taylor actually holds this assumption; Emma could be mistaken. Therefore, the Hypothesis is not necessarily true.  \n  Answer: non-entailment\n\n**Step-by-Step Evaluation:**\n1.  Identify all verbs (especially \"factive\" vs. \"non-factive\") and the structure of belief/claim embedding in the Premise.\n2.  Determine the truth status of clauses:\n    -   If a clause is the complement of a **factive verb**, it is presented as true.\n    -   If a clause is the complement of a **non-factive verb**, it is only presented as part of a belief/assumption, not as a fact.\n3.  For the Hypothesis, check if it is directly asserted as a fact by the Premise, or if it is a necessary consequence of a factive entailment or pronoun resolution.\n4.  **Crucially:** A belief about someone else's mental state (e.g., \"A believes B assumes X\") does **not** entail the truth of that mental state (\"B assumes X\"). It only entails that A holds that belief.\n5.  Confirm the Hypothesis **must be true** if the Premise is true.

If any claim requires assumption or is not supported, entailment fails.\n5. **Avoid Ambiguity:** If the Premise allows multiple interpretations, choose the most literal one unless context forces a specific reading.\n\n**Examples for Reference:**\n- Example A:  \n  Premise: \"Olivia suspects that a gymnast is seen defying gravity as she performs...\"  \n  Hypothesis: \"Olivia suspects that the gymnast is a woman.\"  \n  Reasoning: The pronoun \"she\" in the Premise specifies the gymnast is female, so the Hypothesis must be true.  \n  Answer: entailment\n\n- Example B:  \n  Premise: \"Richard believes that David remembers that a man is sitting...\"  \n  Hypothesis: \"Richard believes that a man is sitting...\"  \n  Reasoning: \"Remembers\" is factive, so believing \"David remembers X\" entails believing X is true.  \n  Answer: entailment\n\n- Example C (Failure Case):  \n  Premise: \"Thomas recognizes that a boy in a green shirt surrounded by toys and another boy, wearing a blue shirt with penguins, to his left.\"  \n  Hypothesis: \"Thomas recognizes that two boys sit in a classroom at their desks.\"  \n  Reasoning: \"Recognizes that\" is factive, so the embedded proposition (two boys with specific descriptions) is true. However, the Hypothesis adds unsupported details (classroom, desks) not necessarily inferred from the Premise. The toys suggest a play environment, not necessarily a classroom.  \n  Answer: non-entailment\n\n**Step-by-Step Evaluation:**\n1. Parse the Premise for factive verbs, presuppositions, and pronouns. Extract any embedded propositions and mark them as true.\n2. Resolve all coreferences, noting properties like gender and number.\n3. Deconstruct the Hypothesis into its individual claims.\n4. For each claim, check if it is directly stated or necessarily inferred from the Premise (using the rules above).\n5. If all claims in the Hypothesis are necessarily true given the Premise, output entailment; otherwise, output non-entailment.\n\nPremise: {premise}\nHypothesis: {hypothesis}\nOptions: entailment, non-entailment\n\nReason step by step, then provide your final answer within <answer> tags.",

Classify the relationship between the Premise (P) and Hypothesis (H) as either `entailment` or `non-entailment`.\n\n**Definitions:**\n- **`entailment`**: The truth of P *guarantees* the truth of H. If P is true, H cannot be false. The information in H must be directly stated or be a necessary logical consequence of the information in P.\n- **`non-entailment`**: P can be true while H is false. This includes contradiction, neutrality, and cases where H introduces information not justified by P (e.g., a claim about a person's belief that is only assumed by someone else in the premise).\n\n**Critical Instructions:**\n1.  **Base analysis strictly on the text.** Consider only the information provided. Do not use external world knowledge, common sense, or personal beliefs. The truth of a *statement about a belief* (e.g., \"X assumes Y\") is not the same as the truth of the believed proposition itself (e.g., \"Y is true\").\n2.  **Analyze linguistic structure.** Pay close attention to words that create separate contexts, such as:\n    -   **Propositional Attitudes:** (e.g., *assumes, believes, thinks, knows, doubts*). The content of a belief is only claimed to be held by that person. It is not asserted as a global truth.\n    -   **Modals and Negations:** (e.g., *might, must, not, never*).\n3.  **For `non-entailment`:** Ask yourself, \"Is it logically possible for P to be true, but for H to be false?\" If yes, the answer is `non-entailment`.\n\n**Reasoning Chain:** Before answering, think step-by-step:\n- Identify the main subjects, verbs, objects, and modifiers in both P and H.\n- Check if H makes a claim that P does not directly support, especially by removing layers of belief or assumption.\n- If P describes a person's belief about another person's belief, this does not guarantee the truth of the inner belief itself.\n\n**Examples of Common Failures:**\n- **Input:** Premise: Taylor assumes that William assumes that a boy at the beach runs... Hypothesis: William assumes that a boy at the beach runs...\n- **Correct Analysis:** The premise only states Taylor's belief about William's assumption. William might not actually hold that assumption. Therefore, P can be true while H is false. This is `non-entailment`.\n- **Incorrect Analysis:** Concluding that because Taylor assumes William assumes something, William must indeed assume it. This is a logical error.\n\n**Now, analyze the following input:**",

Your final answer must be either \"entailment\" or \"non-entailment\".\n\n**Critical Instructions for Reasoning:**\nFollow these steps in order:\n\n1.  **Semantic Analysis:** Parse the meaning of both Premise and Hypothesis. Identify key entities, actions, and states. Note synonyms (e.g., \"man\" / \"human\"), hypernyms (e.g., \"sauna\" is a type of \"room\"), and other semantic relationships. Use world knowledge and pragmatic understanding (e.g., \"dressed only in a towel\" implies a state of undress).\n2.  **Identify Commitment Verbs:** Look for verbs that express belief, knowledge, or suspicion (e.g., \"thinks,\" \"knows,\" \"suspects,\" \"remembers\").\n    *   **Factive Verbs (e.g., \"knows,\" \"remembers\"):** The speaker commits to the truth of the embedded clause.\n    *   **Non-Factive Verbs (e.g., \"thinks,\" \"believes,\" \"suspects\"):** The speaker does not commit to the truth of the embedded clause. The claim is only about the subject's belief state.\n3.  **Apply Factive Logic (If applicable):**\n    *   If a factive verb is asserted by the speaker (e.g., \"A knows that B remembers X\"), then the speaker (A) is committed to the truth of X.\n    *   If only non-factive verbs are used (e.g., \"A believes that B thinks X\"), you cannot assume the speaker believes X is true.\n4.  **Check for Core Entailment:** Temporarily ignore the belief/suspicion verbs. Does the *core factual proposition* within the Premise logically imply the *core factual proposition* within the Hypothesis?\n5.  **Combine the Analyses:**\n    *   **Case 1:** If the speaker is committed to the truth of the premise's core proposition (via a factive verb) AND that proposition entails the hypothesis, then the answer is **entailment**.\n    *   **Case 2:** If the core proposition of the premise entails the core proposition of the hypothesis, but the premise only states that the subject *suspects* or *believes* that core proposition (non-factive verb), then the subject also suspects or believes the entailed hypothesis. This is **entailment**.\n    *   **Case 3:** If the core propositions do not entail each other, the answer is **non-entailment**, regardless of the verbs used.\n\n**Examples to Guide Your Reasoning:**\n\n**Example 1 (Entailment - Factive):**\nPremise: Sarah knows that Mike remembers the password.\nHypothesis: Sarah knows the password.\nReasoning: \"Knows\" and \"remembers\" are factive. Sarah is committed to the truth that Mike remembers the password, which entails that the password is known. The core proposition \"the password is known\" is entailed.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Example 2 (Non-Entailment - Belief):**\nPremise: Chris believes that Emma thinks the story is true.\nHypothesis: Chris believes the story is true.\nReasoning: \"Believes\" and \"thinks\" are non-factive. The core proposition \"the story is true\" is the same. However, Chris's belief is about Emma's opinion, not his own commitment to the story's truth. The verbs block the inference.\nAnswer: non-entailment\n\n**Example 3 (Entailment - Factive Embedding):**\nPremise: Isabella thinks that John remembers that a man is holding an accordion.\nHypothesis: Isabella thinks that a man is holding an accordion.\nReasoning: \"Thinks\" is non-factive, but \"remembers\" is factive. By stating that John *remembers*, Isabella implies she believes John's memory is correct. Therefore, she is committed to the truth of the accordion event. The core proposition is entailed.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Example 4 (Entailment - Semantic & Pragmatic Inference):**\nPremise: Olivia suspects that a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna.\nHypothesis: Olivia suspects that a human not wearing any clothes is in a room.\nReasoning:\n1.  **Semantic Analysis:** \"Man\" → \"human\". \"Sauna\" → \"room\". \"Dressed only in a towel\" pragmatically implies \"not wearing [conventional] clothes\".\n2.  **Commitment Verbs:** \"Suspects\" is non-factive. Olivia is not committed to the truth.\n3.  **Core Entailment:** The core proposition \"a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna\" entails \"a human not wearing any clothes is in a room\".\n4.  **Combination:** Since Olivia suspects the first core proposition, and it entails the second, she must also suspect the second. The non-factive verb \"suspects\" applies to the entire entailed scenario.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Now, analyze the new input:**\nPremise: {Premise}\nHypothesis: {Hypothesis}\nReasoning: Let's think step by step.",

The uncertainty of a non-factive verb applies only to the truth of the deepest embedded proposition, not to the events leading to it.\n5.  **Identify \"Factive-of-the-Event\" Verbs:** Verbs like `learns`, `discovers`, `found out`, `is aware that`, and `realizes` are non-factive regarding a final proposition but are **factive regarding the event they describe**. If `[Person1] [Factive-of-Event-Verb] that [Event]`, then the sentence entails that `[Event]` is true. It does **not** entail that the propositional content inside `[Event]` is true.\n\n**Examples to Guide Your Reasoning:**\n\n**Example 1 (Entailment):**\nPremise: Sarah knows that Mike remembers the password.\nHypothesis: Sarah knows the password.\nReasoning: The verb \"knows\" is factive. Sarah knows that Mike's memory is correct. Therefore, Sarah herself is committed to the truth of the password being known. The premise entails the hypothesis.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Example 2 (Non-Entailment):**\nPremise: Chris believes that Emma thinks the story is true.\nHypothesis: Chris believes the story is true.\nReasoning: The verb \"thinks\" is non-factive. Chris has a belief about Emma's opinion, but he does not necessarily share that opinion himself. The premise does not entail the hypothesis.\nAnswer: non-entailment\n\n**Example 3 (Entailment - Nested Factive):**\nPremise: Isabella thinks that John remembers that a man is holding an accordion.\nHypothesis: Isabella thinks that a man is holding an accordion.\nReasoning: The premise uses the factive verb \"remembers.\" By stating that John *remembers* the event, Isabella is implying that she believes John's memory is correct and the event is true. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Example 4 (Entailment - Factive-of-the-Event):**\nPremise: David discovered that Lisa believed the meeting was canceled.\nHypothesis: Lisa believed the meeting was canceled.\nReasoning: The verb \"discovered\" is non-factive regarding the proposition \"the meeting was canceled.\" However, it is factive regarding the event it describes. For David to *discover* that Lisa believed something, it must be true that Lisa actually held that belief. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis. The truth of the embedded proposition is not relevant to this entailment.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Example 5 (Non-Entailment - Deep Proposition):**\nPremise: Olivia learns that Evelyn assumes that two men are playing in a lake.\nHypothesis: Two men are playing in a lake.\nReasoning: The verb \"learns\" is factive-of-the-event, so it entails that \"Evelyn assumes X\" is true. However, \"assumes\" is non-factive. The premise only tells us about Evelyn's assumption and Olivia's awareness of it. It does not commit anyone to the truth of the proposition \"two men are playing in a lake.\" Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.\nAnswer: non-entailment\n\n**Now, analyze the new input:**\nPremise: {Premise}\nHypothesis: {Hypothesis}\nReasoning: Let's think step by step.",

Your final answer must be either \"entailment\" or \"non-entailment\".\n\n**Critical Instructions for Reasoning:**\n1.  **Identify and classify all verbs introducing a clause.**\n    *   **A factive verb** is one where `[Subject] [verb] that P` entails that the speaker believes `P` is true. Common factive verbs include:\n        *   **Cognitive factives:** \"knows,\" \"remembers,\" \"forgets,\" \"realizes\"\n        *   **Perceptive factives:** \"sees,\" \"hears,\" \"notices\" (when followed by a `that`-clause)\n        *   **Emotive factives:** \"regrets,\" \"is glad that,\" \"is sad that\"\n    *   **A belief (non-factive) verb** does not entail the speaker's commitment to the truth of `P`. Common belief verbs include: \"thinks,\" \"believes,\" \"assumes,\" \"supposes,\" \"expects.\"\n    *   **Crucial:** The verb \"sees\" is **factive** when used as `\"sees that P\"` but is **not factive** when used as `\"sees something\"` (a noun phrase).\n\n2.  **A person who asserts a factive claim commits to its truth.** For example, if \"A thinks that B knows/remembers/sees that X,\" this entails that \"A thinks X\" is true. Asserting a factive verb is a stronger claim than a belief verb; it means the speaker believes the subsequent information is correct.\n3.  **Do not assume entailment for non-factive verbs.** If \"A thinks that B believes X,\" this does not entail that \"A believes X.\"\n\n**Examples to Guide Your Reasoning:**\n\n**Example 1 (Entailment):**\nPremise: Sarah knows that Mike remembers the password.\nHypothesis: Sarah knows the password.\nReasoning: The verb \"knows\" is factive. Sarah knows that Mike's memory is correct. Therefore, Sarah herself is committed to the truth of the password being known.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Example 2 (Non-Entailment):**\nPremise: Chris believes that Emma thinks the story is true.\nHypothesis: Chris believes the story is true.\nReasoning: The verb \"thinks\" is non-factive. Chris has a belief about Emma's opinion, but he does not necessarily share that opinion himself.\nAnswer: non-entailment\n\n**Example 3 (Entailment):**\nPremise: Isabella thinks that John remembers that a man is holding an accordion.\nHypothesis: Isabella thinks that a man is holding an accordion.\nReasoning: The verb \"remembers\" is factive. By stating that John *remembers* the event, Isabella is implying that she believes John's memory is correct and the event is true.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Example 4 (Entailment - Perception Verb):**\nPremise: David hears that Anna sees that the package has been delivered.\nHypothesis: David hears that the package has been delivered.\nReasoning: The verb \"sees\" is factive when used with a `that`-clause. \"Anna sees that the package has been delivered\" entails that the package has been delivered. David is hearing a report that contains this factive claim.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Example 5 (Non-Entailment - Non-factive \"sees\"):**\nPremise: Lisa believes that Tom sees a ghost.\nHypothesis: Lisa believes that a ghost exists.\nReasoning: The verb \"sees\" here is followed by a noun phrase (\"a ghost\"), not a `that`-clause. In this construction, \"sees\" is not factive; it describes a perceptual experience that may not be real. Lisa believes Tom is having that experience, but she does not necessarily commit to the existence of the ghost.\nAnswer: non-entailment\n\n**Example 6 (Entailment - Correcting a Common Mistake):**\nPremise: Isabella assumes that Michael sees that a young man is jumping over rocks.\nHypothesis: Isabella assumes that a young man is jumping over rocks.\nReasoning: The verb \"sees\" is used with a `that`-clause, making it factive. \"Michael sees that P\" entails P is true. Isabella's assumption includes this factive claim, meaning she assumes the event (P) is true.\nAnswer: entailment\n\n**Now, analyze the new input:**\nPremise: {Premise}\nHypothesis: {Hypothesis}\nReasoning: Let's think step by step.\n**First, identify and classify every verb introducing a clause (e.g., as factive or non-factive). Then, apply the rules of commitment to determine if the premise entails the hypothesis.**",

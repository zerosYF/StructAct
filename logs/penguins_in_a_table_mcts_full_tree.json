The subject (e.g., penguins, giraffes) is defined by the table itself.\n\n2.  **Reason Strictly from the Table:** Answer the question using only the information present in the relevant table. Perform necessary operations like sorting, filtering, or comparing values.\n\n3.  **Handle Ambiguity or Missing Data:** If information critical to the question is missing for some entries (e.g., a 'species' attribute), you may apply a reasonable, minimal assumption only if the table's context supports it. If the required data is completely absent from the entire table and no logical assumption can be made, proceed to step 4.\n\n4.  **Choose from Options:** Your final answer must always be one of the provided options. If the data is missing and no assumption can be made, select the option that represents the closest logical match based on the available information. Output only your final choice.",

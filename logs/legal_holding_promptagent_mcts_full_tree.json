    "prompt": "You are given a snippet from a legal opinion that ends with a citation followed by a `<HOLDING>` placeholder. The placeholder must be filled with the **exact, verbatim holding** from the case that was just cited.\n\nYour task is to select the single candidate option that is a direct quote from the specific case cited immediately before the `<HOLDING>` placeholder. Do not rely on the surrounding text for legal reasoning; use it only to identify the correct citation. Your decision must be based on a verbatim text match, not on which option best summarizes the legal concept.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n1.  Locate the case citation that comes directly before the `<HOLDING>` tag.\n2.  Match the text of the candidate options to the known, verbatim holding from that specific case.\n3.  Ignore the context of the paragraph. The opinion snippet is merely quoting another case; your goal is to find that case's precise holding.\n4.  Output only the numeric index of the correct option.\n\n**Examples of Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n-   **Mistake:** Choosing an option that is a good summary of the paragraph's topic but not the quoted case's holding.\n-   **Example:** In a snippet citing *Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing*, the model incorrectly selected a option about prosecutorial misconduct because it fit the broader topic of evidence, rather than the correct option about judging JMOL motions.\n-   **Correct Approach:** The citation (*Reeves*) is the only clue. Find the option that is a direct quote from *Reeves*.\n\n-   **Mistake:** Selecting the most comprehensive legal principle instead of the direct quote.\n-   **Example:** In a snippet citing *Mead*, the model incorrectly chose a long, accurate summary of *Chevron* deference instead of the shorter, verbatim holding from the *Mead* decision.\n-   **Correct Approach:** Prioritize a verbatim match over conceptual accuracy. The task is to complete the sentence with a quote, not to analyze the law.\n\nOutput your final answer as the numeric index wrapped in `<answer>` tags, e.g., `<answer>2</answer>`.",

Your goal is to find the option that states this rule.\n*   **Avoid False Precision:** Multiple options may state the same core rule with slightly different wording. Do not reject an option solely because it uses a synonym or a slightly less detailed phrasing. If an option accurately captures the essence of the holding, it may be correct.\n*   **Precedent is Key:** The holding must be based on the actual, widely accepted precedent of the target case. If you know the case, rely on that knowledge first. The text snippet provides context but may not state the holding explicitly.\n*   **Beware of \"Red Herrings\":** Options may contain factually true statements that describe the *scenario* of the case or a *related* legal concept, but not the specific holding. Your task is to isolate the new legal rule the case established.\n\n**Examples of Common Errors to Avoid:**\n\n*   **Example 1 - Misinterpreting Nuance:**\n    *   **Case:** *Washington v. Harper*\n    *   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Selecting an option that says \"holding that the due process clause permits involuntary medication of a dangerous inmate\" because it seems correct, while rejecting the more precise option that includes the key prerequisites of \"seriously mentally ill\" and \"treatment is medically appropriate.\"\n    *   **Correct Approach:** The holding has specific elements; an option missing key elements is incomplete and should be rejected.\n\n*   **Example 2 - Over-relying on Snippet Context:**\n    *   **Case:** *Commonwealth v. Grant*\n    *   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Selecting an option that says \"as a general rule\" because the text snippet discusses timing, while rejecting the option that states the definitive holding (\"should be deferred\") because it sounds too absolute.\n    *   **Correct Approach:** The actual holding of the case is a definitive rule. Your knowledge of the precedent must override minor linguistic interpretations of the options.\n\n*   **Example 3 - Confusing Facts with Holding:**\n    *   **Case:** A case about a 180-mile transfer.\n    *   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Selecting an option that merely describes the factual scenario (e.g., \"a transfer of 180 miles occurred\") but does not state the legal conclusion the court reached about that scenario.\n    *   **Correct Approach:** The holding is the legal rule applied to the facts (e.g., \"such a transfer did not *necessarily* constitute an adverse action\").\n\n**Final Instruction:**\nProceed by following the steps and guidelines above.

Hardy\").\n2.  **Understand the Legal Context:** Read the surrounding text carefully to understand the legal principle being discussed and how the target case relates to it.\n3.  **Evaluate Each Candidate:** Critically assess each option against the known precedent of the target case. Eliminate options that:\n    *   Describe holdings from other cases.\n    *   Are factually incorrect based on legal knowledge.\n    *   Are incomplete or misleading summaries.\n4.  **Select and Verify:** Identify the option that most accurately and completely states the actual holding of the target case. **Note its position (index) in the list of candidate options (starting from 0).**\n5.  **Output Format:**\n    *   First, think through your reasoning step-by-step.\n    *   On the final line, output your answer in the exact format: `Final Answer: [index number]`\n\n**Examples to Guide Your Reasoning (Learn from These Mistakes):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input Snippet:** ...Compare Allen v. Hardy, 478 U.S. 255 (<HOLDING>)...\n    *   **Candidate Options List:**\n        `[ 'holding that a challenge for cause might have been justified...', 'holding that the district court's observation was sufficient...', 'holding that batson v kentucky does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review' ]`\n    *   **Reasoning:** The holding of *Allen v. Hardy* is that Batson does not apply retroactively on collateral review. This matches the text of the third option in the list.\n    *   **Correct Output:** The third option is at index **2** in the zero-indexed list.\n        `Final Answer: 2`\n    *   **Error to Avoid:** Do not output `3`. The list index starts at 0.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input Snippet:** ...(184 SE 858) (1936) (<HOLDING>). Cf. DTI Logistics, Inc., 300 Ga. App. at...\n    *   **Candidate Options List:**\n        `[ 'holding despite a reservation of rights that when the insurer...', 'holding that insureds demand to insurer was liquidated when insurer...', 'holding that in a dispute between insurer and insured...', 'holding that if the insured is only partially compensated...', 'holding that court of appeals was without jurisdiction...' ]`\n    *   **Reasoning:** The holding of *Mills v. Southern R. Co.* (184 SE 858) is that a claim only becomes liquidated after a judgment fixes the amount. This matches the text of the *third* option in the list (index 2).\n    *   **Correct Output:**\n        `Final Answer: 2`\n    *   **Error to Avoid:** Do not confuse the correct legal reasoning with the correct index. The option describing the holding of *Mills* is at position 2, not position 1.\n\n**Final Instruction:**\nAlways remember: the options are in a zero-indexed list. Your final answer must be the index number (0, 1, 2, ...) of the correct holding, not a hypothetical number from a 1-based list.\n\nProceed by following the steps above. Think step by step.",

However, the *actual holding* of *Williams v. 29 P.2d 668* is that a constitutional provision is self-executing if it can operate without further legislation. Option 3 states this holding. Option 2, while related to the snippet's context, describes a different legal principle and is not the holding of *Williams*.\n    *   **Correct Output:** The correct holding is at index **3**.\n        `Final Answer: 3`\n    *   **Error to Avoid:** Do not select an option just because it fits the context of the sentence.

                "prompt": "You are given a snippet from a legal opinion that ends with a case citation followed by a `<HOLDING>` placeholder. Your task is to select the candidate option that provides the exact, verbatim holding from the case cited **immediately before the `<HOLDING>` tag**.\n\n**Critical Reasoning Steps:**\n1.  **Identify the Target Case:** Locate the case citation directly before the `<HOLDING>` tag. This is the case whose holding you must output. Ignore any other citations in the snippet.\n2.  **Determine the Citation's Function:** Analyze how the target case is being cited. The text preceding it provides crucial clues:\n    -   If the text flows grammatically into the citation (e.g., \"...is liquid [citation]\"), it is likely the **start of a direct quote** from that case. The correct option will be its **verbatim completion**.\n    -   If the text is a complete statement followed by a citation signal like \"see,\" \"see also,\" or \"cf.\" (e.g., \"...for abuse of discretion. *See* [citation]\"), the text is the **author's summary**. The correct option will be the **verbatim holding** of the cited case that supports this summary, which may not complete the sentence.\n3.  **Match the Verbatim Holding:** Treat the candidate options as potential direct quotes from the target case. Your goal is a word-for-word match. The option must be the precise legal rule for which the target case is authoritative, not a summary of its facts or a related legal concept.\n4.  **Prioritize the Cited Case's Holding Over Context:** The surrounding paragraph's topic is irrelevant. Do not choose an option just because it fits the broader subject matter. Rely solely on the identity of the cited case and the verbatim text of the options.\n\n**Examples of Failure and Correction:**\n\n-   **Failure Example (Direct Quote):**\n    -   **Input Snippet:** \"...a demand is liquid (184 SE 858) (1936) (<HOLDING>).\"\n    -   **Incorrect Approach:** Choosing Option 1 ('holding that insureds demand... was liquidated') because it matches the paragraph's topic.\n    -   **Correct Approach & Output:** The text \"a demand is liquid\" is the beginning of a quote. Option 2 ('holding that... the claim became liquidated') is the correct verbatim completion. `<answer>2</answer>`\n\n-   **Failure Example (Citation as Support - This Prompt's Critical Improvement):**\n    -   **Input Snippet:** \"...is reviewed for abuse of discretion only. See Bull v. INS, 790 F.2d 869 (<HOLDING>).\"\n    -   **Incorrect Approach (Previous Prompt's Mistake):** Choosing an option that best completes the author's sentence (e.g., 'holding that the decision lies in the sound discretion of the court...') because it is a good textual and conceptual fit.\n    -   **Correct Approach:** The text before the citation is the author's own statement. The task is to find the *verbatim holding of Bull v. INS*. The correct option is the specific finding from that case (e.g., 'holding denial of continuance to be an abuse of discretion' or its negation). The author's sentence is context, not the start of a quote.\n    -   **Correct Output:** `<answer>3</answer>`\n\n**Final Instruction:**\nOutput only the numeric index of the option that contains the verbatim holding from the case cited immediately before the `<HOLDING>` tag. Wrap your final answer in `<answer>` tags (e.g., `<answer>1</answer>`).",

Your task is to select the candidate option that provides the exact, verbatim holding from the case cited immediately before the `<HOLDING>` tag.\n\n**Critical Reasoning Steps:**\n1.  **Identify the Cited Case:** Locate the full case citation directly before the `<HOLDING>` tag (e.g., *Ex parte Trawick, 698 So.2d 162 (Ala.1997)*). This is the only case whose holding you must find.\n2.  **Determine the Quote Type:**\n    -   **If the citation is preceded by a direct quote signal** (e.g., \"stated:\", \"held that\", \"writing:\", or a colon `:`), then the text between that signal and the citation is the beginning of a verbatim quote. Your goal is to find the option that contains the exact words that complete this quote.\n    -   **If the citation is preceded by a reference signal** (e.g., \"see, e.g.,\", \"cf.\", \"see\"), it is only being used as an example or support. There is no direct quote to complete. Ignore all surrounding text and focus solely on matching the verbatim holding of the cited case.\n3.  **Execute a Strict Verbatim Match:** Compare the options against the known, standard holding of the case identified in Step 1.\n    -   The correct option will be a precise, word-for-word match for the core legal principle from that specific case.\n    -   Eliminate any option that discusses a different subject matter, cites a different case, or is merely a paraphrase of the correct holding.\n4.  **Ignore All Surrounding Context:** The paragraph's topic, other citations, and the author's legal argument are irrelevant and often misleading. Your decision must be based exclusively on the textual relationship between the cited case and the options, or on known legal knowledge of that case's holding.\n\n**Examples of Failure and Correction:**\n\n-   **Failure Example (Misidentifying Quote):**\n    -   **Input Snippet:** \"...‘Merely showing that the challenged party struck one or more members of a particular race is not sufficient to establish a prima facie case.’ Edwards [v. State], 628 So.2d [1021,] 1024 [ (Ala.Crim.App.1993) ]. See also Ex parte Trawick, 698 So.2d 162 (Ala.1997) (<HOLDING>).\"\n    -   **Incorrect Approach (Model's Mistake):** Assuming the text \"‘Merely showing... prima facie case.’\" is a quote from *Trawick* and selecting an option that completes it.\n    -   **Correct Approach:** The signal \"See also\" indicates *Trawick* is a supporting reference, not the source of the previous quote. The quote is from *Edwards*. The correct option must be the verbatim holding of *Ex parte Trawick* itself, which is about the strike of a single juror without a pattern.\n\n-   **Failure Example (Misinterpreting \"e.g.\"):**\n    -   **Input Snippet:** \"...provide enhanced protections beyond the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., State v. Eckel, 185 N.J. 523 (2006) (<HOLDING>);\"\n    -   **Incorrect Approach:** Choosing an option that exemplifies \"enhanced protections\" but is not the actual holding of *State v. Eckel*.\n    -   **Correct Approach:** The signal \"See, e.g.\" means *Eckel* is an example. Ignore the context of \"enhanced protections.\" The correct option is the verbatim holding from *Eckel*, which concerns the scope of vehicle searches incident to arrest.\n\n**Final Instruction:**\nPerform a strict verbatim match focused solely on the holding of the cited case. The presence of a colon or a quote signal is the only reason to look for a sentence completion. Otherwise, disregard the snippet's text entirely.

Roe.\n    -   **Correct Approach:** Recognize that \"See also\" indicates no direct quote. Select the verbatim holding of Doe v. Roe from the options.\n\n-   **Failure Example (Incorrect Options):**\n    -   **Input Snippet:** \"...See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing, 530 U.S. 133 (2000) (<HOLDING>).\"\n    -   **Incorrect Approach:** Selecting an option about Brady violations because it uses legal terminology present in the paragraph.\n    -   **Correct Approach:** Recognize that Reeves concerns JMOL standards, not Brady. Choose the option that accurately states the Reeves holding about judging JMOL motions.\n\n-   **Failure Example (String Citation):**\n    -   **Input Snippet:** \"...for this principle. See Case A, 100 U.S. 1; Case B, 200 U.S. 2; Case C, 300 U.S. 3 (<HOLDING>).\"\n    -   **Incorrect Approach:** Assuming the holding applies to the entire citation string.\n    -   **Correct Approach:** The <HOLDING> applies to the last case (Case C). Select the verbatim holding for Case C.\n\n**Final Instruction:**\nFirst determine if a direct quote from the cited case precedes the citation. If yes, find its verbatim completion.

Find the option that matches *Reeves*' holding.\n\n-   **Mistake:** Selecting a comprehensive legal principle instead of the direct quote.\n-   **Example:** In a snippet citing *Mead*, the model chose a long, accurate summary of *Chevron* deference instead of the shorter, verbatim holding from *Mead*.\n-   **Correction:** Prioritize verbatim match over conceptual accuracy.\n\n-   **Mistake:** Failing to recognize when no option is a verbatim match and guessing based on context.\n-   **Example:** In a snippet citing *Bogan*, the model selected a paraphrased option about motive because it was conceptually close, rather than the option that was textually closest to *Bogan*'s actual holding.\n-   **Correction:** When no perfect match exists, choose the option with the highest textual similarity to the cited case's holding.\n\n**Few-Shot Examples for Guidance:**\n-   **Input:** ...Christian v.

This leads to selecting a option about the constitutional principle instead of the procedural holding.\n    -   **Lesson:** Take the citation at face value. If it is ambiguous (e.g., \"App.1990)\"), you must rely on the context and the candidate options to infer the correct holding, prioritizing the option that is a verbatim match for a case that fits that citation format.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** After following the steps above, output your final answer as the numeric index wrapped in `<answer>` tags, e.g., `<answer>2</answer>`.",

See, e.g., Goldblatt, 417 N.W.2d at 419 (<HOLDING>).`\n    -   **Mistake:** Selecting an option about res judicata barring a landlord's claim (Option 4) because it seems related to preclusion, a broad topic in the paragraph. The model ignored that the citation is ambiguous and the context's mention of \"formal-pleading\" was primarily supported by a *previous* case (`Gies`). The correct option (0) was the actual holding of `Goldblatt`.\n    -   **Lesson:** When a citation is abbreviated, the context is a weak guide. Prioritize the option that is a verbatim holding from a case that matches the citation's format (e.g., a state appellate case) and is least incompatible with the context. Do not force a match to the immediate sentence's topic if it was established by a prior citation.\n\n**CRITICAL: AVOID COMMON TRAPS**\n*   **Trap 1: Do not select an option just because it perfectly matches the topic of the paragraph.** The option must be the holding of the specifically cited case. A prior citation may be the source of the broader topic.\n*   **Trap 2: The context tells you *why* the case is cited, not *what* its holding is.** Use the context to avoid options that are irrelevant, but do not let it override the requirement that the holding must come from the cited case.\n*   **Trap 3: The \"holding\" is what the court decided in the cited case.** It often, but not always, includes a general legal rule. Prioritize options that state a conclusion specific to the case's facts over those that only state a generic rule.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** After following the steps above, output your final answer as the numeric index wrapped in `<answer>` tags, e.g., `<answer>2</answer>`.",

Focus solely on the factual evidence described (e.g., testimony about a prior conviction, indictment, or restitution). Ignore any text in parentheses that is a legal citation (e.g., `Cir.1977)`); it is a reference to other law and is not a fact of this case.\n2.  **Infer the Legal Issue:** Ask: \"In an appellate holding, what legal question would this specific evidence be most relevant to?

Eliminate options that address unrelated legal questions (e.g., drug offenses, state-specific rules) if the facts do not support them. The correct holding will directly concern the legal issue you inferred.\n4.  **Avoid Pitfalls:**\n    *   Do not assume the case is about the crime mentioned in the evidence (e.g., a prior theft does not mean the current case is about theft).\n    *   Do not be misled by keywords from citations; they are not part of the case's facts.\n    *   Base your choice only on the connection between the evidence and the legal issue it implies.\n\n**Example of Failure and Correction:**\n*   **Snippet:** \"...testified that Stout had given him a worthless check and that Stout had been ordered to pay restitution...

The snippet will contain a citation to a prior case immediately followed by a `<HOLDING>` tag. Your goal is to identify the holding of that specific cited case.\n\n**Follow these steps precisely:**\n\n1.  **Locate the Target Citation:** \n    - Scan the snippet for a case citation immediately preceding the `<HOLDING>` tag. The citation may appear in parentheses `(...)` or as a standard legal citation format (e.g., *Case Name*, Volume Reporter Page (Year)).\n    - If multiple citations are present, select the one closest to and immediately preceding `<HOLDING>`.\n    - **If no citation is found:** Check if the `<HOLDING>` tag is adjacent to a case name without parentheses (e.g., \"...as held in *Case Name* <HOLDING>\"). If so, treat that as the target. If still not found, proceed to Step 2 using the immediate context of the `<HOLDING>` tag.\n\n2.  **Determine the Citation's Role:** \n    - Read the sentence and the immediate context that leads into the citation or `<HOLDING>` tag. Ask: \"What legal point is the author using this case to support or establish?\" The cited case's holding will directly resolve the issue mentioned in this context.\n\n3.  **Match the Holding:** \n    - Review the candidate holdings. Select the option that most accurately summarizes the ruling of the specific case identified in Step 1. The correct option will be a direct paraphrase of that case's core legal conclusion.\n    - **Check for Relevance:** If the candidate holdings seem unrelated to the citation's context, re-examine Step 1. If the mismatch persists, select the option that best matches the cited case's role inferred from context.\n\n4.  **Avoid Pitfalls:**\n    - **Do not reason about the broader paragraph** beyond the immediate context of the citation. The main text provides background, but the answer is found by analyzing the cited case's specific role.\n    - **Do not be misled by keywords** from unrelated parts of the snippet or from other, ignored citations. The correct answer is tied exclusively to the citation adjacent to `<HOLDING>`.\n    - **Prioritize contextual matching:** If an option contains language that directly mirrors the legal point established by the cited case in the context, it is highly likely to be correct.\n\n5.  **Output:**\n    - If no citation is found and the context is too ambiguous to infer a specific case's holding, output `<answer>Unable to determine</answer>`.\n    - Otherwise, output the numerical index of the correct option wrapped in <answer> tags (e.g., <answer>3</answer>).\n\n**Critical Examples of Failure and Correction:**\n\n*   **Example Snippet A:** \"...both parties agree that, under New Mexico law, a vendor’s interest in a real estate contract is personalty, and not real property.

Therefore, the issue is...\"\n    *   **Incorrect Approach:** Inferring that the case is about Article 9 perfection requirements and selecting an option about judgment liens not attaching because the interest is personalty.\n    *   **Correct Approach:** Identifying that *Marks v. City of Tucumcari* is the cited case. The sentence states this case establishes the nature of the vendor's interest. The correct holding will be the specific ruling from *Marks*, which is option 3: \"holding that the citys judgment lien could not attach to vendors legal title because the interest retained by a vendor under an executory contract of sale was personalty\".\n\n*   **Example Snippet B:** \"...If EPA refuses to reimburse the PRP, then the PRP may file suit in a federal district court, where the PRP can challenge both liability and remedy selection. S ir.2005) (<HOLDING>). And given the size of the record...\"\n    *   **Incorrect Approach:** Ignoring the garbled citation and inferring a general due process issue about error rates in UAOs, leading to the selection of an option about a \"substantial risk of erroneous deprivation\".\n    *   **Correct Approach:** Recognizing that `S ir.2005)` is the target citation despite its garbled nature. The sentence uses it to support a point about challenges to EPA reimbursement decisions. The correct holding is the ruling of *that* case, which is option 1: \"holding that a 746 percent error rate is unacceptably high\".\n\n*   **Example Snippet C:** \"...the appellant contends and earnestly argues that the evidence upon her trial was insufficient to sustain her conviction, and the judgment entered upon it (<HOLDING>) Putting aside for later attention herein, the\"\n    *   **Incorrect Approach:** Selecting an option based on general legal principles about sentencing or probation because the candidate holdings are all on that topic, despite the context being about sufficiency of evidence.\n    *   **Correct Approach:** Recognizing that no valid citation is present. The immediate context discusses challenging a conviction based on insufficient evidence. Since the candidate holdings are about probation (a mismatched topic), and no citation can be identified, the correct output would be `<answer>Unable to determine</answer>`.\n\n**Now, analyze the provided case snippet. Find the citation immediately preceding the `<HOLDING>` tag and select the option that states its holding. Output your final answer as the numerical index of the correct option wrapped in <answer> tags (e.g., <answer>3</answer>), or <answer>Unable to determine</answer> if no citation can be found and the context is ambiguous.**",

It must flow seamlessly from the text before it and into the text after it.\n    *   **Parallel Citation Analysis:** If the `<HOLDING>` citation is part of a string of citations (e.g., \"See X; Y v. Z (<HOLDING>)\"), analyze the holding of the other cited case(s). The correct holding for `<HOLDING>` will often be thematically parallel (similar type of ruling, similar context, e.g., both about internal reports or both about procedural rulings).\n    *   The correct holding will be the one that perfectly completes the sentence or argument presented in the snippet. It will be a logical and exact extension of the court's reasoning.\n    *   Reject holdings that are too broad, too narrow, or related to a different legal issue, even if they contain keywords from the snippet.\n\n4.  **Avoid Common Pitfalls:**\n    *   **Pitfall 1 (Keyword Matching):** Do not select a holding just because it shares words with the snippet (e.g., \"treatment,\" \"unconstitutional\"). Analyze the context and legal logic.\n    *   **Pitfall 2 (Misinterpreting Precedent):** The snippet may cite a prior case. Do not assume the current case is about that prior case's specific subject. The citation is used to support a broader legal principle.\n    *   **Pitfall 3 (Ignoring Key Context):** The text surrounding the `<HOLDING>` placeholder is the most important. Do not base your decision on parts of the snippet that are not directly relevant to the immediate context of the citation.\n    *   **Pitfall 4 (Using External Knowledge):** You must base your analysis solely on the text of the snippet and the candidate options. Do not use any prior knowledge of the specific cases cited (e.g., \"184 SE 858\" or \"Spiegla v. Hull\"). Your reasoning must be derived entirely from the provided text. The options contain the only truths you need.\n\n**Failure Examples and Corrections:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Snippet:** `...see also State v. Bonafide, 457 N.W.2d 211, 215 (Minn.App.1990) (<HOLDING>). Although treatment may be available both as...`\n    *   **Incorrect Choice (Pitfall 1 & 3):** Option 3: 'holding defendant who received treatment in a state hospital was not entitled to jail credit for that time'. This is a surface-level keyword match on \"treatment.\"\n    *   **Correct Reasoning:** The sentence structure \"see also\" indicates the cited case supports a contrasting or analogous point. The text after the citation (\"Although treatment may be available...\") suggests the holding draws a distinction. The correct holding (Option 4) specifies a nuanced distinction about civil commitment orders, making it the precise fit for the argument being made.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Snippet:** `...their constitutionality can only be attacked as applied in particular circumstances. Williams v. 29 P.2d 668, 670 (1942) (<HOLDING>). Moreover, the Rules empower the Commission to...`\n    *   **Incorrect Choice (Pitfall 1):** Option 2: 'holding that a statute is unconstitutional if it clearly contravenes a constitutional provision'. This is a general truism about unconstitutionality but is not specific to the *facial vs. as-applied* distinction being discussed.\n    *   **Correct Reasoning:** The snippet is explicitly about the standard for a *facial* challenge. The correct holding must directly address this. Option 3, which defines a \"self-executing\" constitutional provision, is the precise legal concept that determines whether a rule can be challenged facially for failing to implement it.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Snippet:** `...a demand is liquid (184 SE 858) (1936) (<HOLDING>).`\n    *   **Incorrect Choice (Pitfall 1 & 4):** Option 1: 'holding that insureds demand to insurer was liquidated when insurer did not point to any evidence...'. This option states a general rule, but the sentence structure \"a demand is liquid (citation)\" signals the citation is providing an *example* of a liquid demand, not defining the rule.\n    *   **Correct Reasoning:** The citation is used illustratively. The correct holding (Option 2) provides the specific factual holding from the cited case that serves as the example: 'holding that in a dispute... it was only after entry of a judgment... that the claim became liquidated.' This completes the sentence perfectly.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   **Snippet:** `...See Orange, 59 F.3d at 1273 (finding that the plaintiffs speech was a matter of public concern because it regarded \"potential fraud at a public university.”); Spiegla v. Hull, 371 F.3d 928, 935-36 (7th Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>).`\n    *   **Incorrect Choice (Pitfall 2 & 4):** Option 4: 'holding that a public employees deposition testimony involves a matter of public concern...'. While valid, it breaks the parallel structure. The *Orange* case is about internal speech. The *Spiegla* citation, connected by a semicolon, is most likely an analogous example.\n    *   **Correct Reasoning:** The \"see\" signal and parallel structure indicate both citations are examples of protected speech. The correct holding (Option 1) mirrors the *Orange* case by also concerning internal communications ('internal memoranda'), making it the most precise and logical fit.\n\n**Now, analyze the provided case snippet and candidate options.

            "prompt": "You are an expert legal analyst. Your task is to analyze a legal text snippet and select the single correct holding from the candidate options. The snippet may contain factual evidence from a trial record or legal discussion citing other cases.\n\n**Follow these steps precisely:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Focus Case:** Determine which case's holding is being referenced. Look for a citation followed by `<HOLDING>` (e.g., `State v. Eckel, 185 N.J. 523 (2006) (<HOLDING>)`). The candidate holdings are for *this specific cited case*. If no case is explicitly cited with `<HOLDING>`, then the holding belongs to the main case described in the snippet.\n\n2.  **Extract Key Information:**\n    *   If the snippet describes **factual evidence** (e.g., testimony about a prior conviction), isolate these facts. Ignore any legal citations in parentheses that are not part of the factual narrative.\n    *   If the snippet is a **legal discussion** citing other cases, identify the context of the citation (e.g., \"compare,\" \"contrast,\" \"see\") and the legal principle being illustrated.\n\n3.  **Infer the Legal Issue:** Ask: \"What specific legal question does this evidence or citation context imply?\"\n    *   For **factual evidence**: \"What legal issue is this evidence most relevant to? (e.g., challenging a sentence enhancement, disputing an element of a charge)?\"\n    *   For a **cited case**: \"What legal issue does this case resolve? How is it being used in the argument (e.g., as a contrast to another rule)?\"\n\n4.  **Match Issue to Holding:** Review the candidate holdings. The correct option will directly address the legal issue you inferred. Eliminate any option that:\n    *   Concerns an unrelated legal doctrine (e.g., vehicle search vs. home search).\n    *   Does not align with the citation context (e.g., if the snippet contrasts two cases, the holding should reflect that contrast).\n\n5.  **Avoid Critical Pitfalls:**\n    *   The crime mentioned in evidence (e.g., a prior theft) does not mean the current case is about that crime.\n    *   Keywords from legal citations (e.g., `Cir.1977`) are not facts of the case and should be ignored.\n    *   Do not assume the holding must directly relate to the main case's facts; it may be from a cited case addressing a different scenario.\n\n**Examples of Failure and Correction:**\n\n*   **Example 1 (Factual Evidence):**\n    *   **Snippet:** \"...testified that Stout had given him a worthless check and that Stout had been ordered to pay restitution... (Cir.1977)\"\n    *   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Focusing on \"Cir.1977\" and assuming the case is about the legal topic cited there.\n    *   **Correct Reasoning:** The evidence of a prior bad check is likely used to prove a prior conviction for a sentence enhancement. The correct holding will be about the validity of such an enhancement.\n\n*   **Example 2 (Legal Citation):**\n    *   **Snippet:** \"The court contrasted the rule in Griffith (retroactive on direct review) with Allen v. Hardy, 478 U.S. 255 (1986) (<HOLDING>).\"\n    *   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Choosing a holding that applies retroactively to direct review (like Griffith).\n    *   **Correct Reasoning:** The word \"contrasted\" indicates the holding from *Allen v. Hardy* is the opposite of *Griffith*. It should be about *non*-retroactivity on collateral review.\n\n**Now, analyze the provided snippet and candidate options.

Ignore all items owned by others (e.g., \"my father has\", \"my sister has\").\n2.  **Final Quantity:** For each owned item, extract ONLY the final quantity stated at the end of its description. Disregard any backstory, explanations, or intermediate quantities.\n3.  **Question-Based Categorization:** Analyze the question to determine which two categories are relevant (e.g., \"musical instruments\" and \"animals/insects\", \"cars\" and \"mobiles\", \"fruits\" and \"animals/insects\"). You will need to identify both categories from the question.\n4.  **Categorization and Verification:** For every item you extracted:\n    *   Determine what the item is (e.g., \"bansuri\", \"iphone x\", \"raven\").\n    *   Classify it into one of the categories required by the question. If an item does not belong to either relevant category, it must be excluded from all sums.\n    *   **Explicitly verify the category.** For example, a \"camel\" is an animal, not a car. A \"nissan maxima\" is a car, not an animal. A \"violin\" is a musical instrument, not an animal.\n5.  **Handling Ambiguity:** If an item's name is ambiguous, compound, or contains a likely typo (e.g., \"26 vibraphone, steelpans\", \"toyota 4runnertoyota sequoia\"), use the following rule:\n    *   **The final quantity applies to the entire noun phrase.** Treat \"26 vibraphone, steelpans\" as a single entry with a quantity of 26. If the entire phrase describes objects from the same relevant category (e.g., both are musical instruments), count it once. If it describes objects from different categories, use the quantity for each respective category. If you cannot determine this, default to the given quantity for the entire phrase.\n6.  **Summation:**\n    *   Sum the quantities of all items belonging to the first relevant category.\n    *   Sum the quantities of all items belonging to the second relevant category.\n    *   Use these sums to perform the final requested operation (e.g., sum, absolute difference).\n7.  **Output Structure:** Present your final answer clearly within the tags `<answer>...</answer>`.\n\n### Process to Follow:\n- **Step 1:** List every \"I have\" item with its final quantity.\n- **Step 2:** From this list, identify and list all items that belong to the first category required by the question.\n- **Step 3:** From this list, identify and list all items that belong to the second category required by the question.\n- **Step 4:** Sum the quantities for the first category.\n- **Step 5:** Sum the quantities for the second category.\n- **Step 6:** Perform the final operation (e.g., |Sum1 - Sum2|).\n- **Step 7:** State the final answer.\n\nThink step by step. Be meticulous to avoid missing any \"I have\" items and to correctly classify them. Double-check your categorizations to ensure items are not misclassified (e.g., \"camels\" are animals, not cars).",

Do NOT count them in animals/insects.\n- **Input:** \"I have 36 cattles...\" \n- **Correct Categorization:** \"cattles\" are animals (assuming typo for cattle).

Note: Brand names containing fruit words (e.g., \"iPhone\") are NOT fruits.\n    - For animals/insects: Include any living creature (e.g., \"dog\", \"ant\", \"eagle\").\n    - For musical instruments: Include any instrument (e.g., \"piano\", \"guitar\", \"drum\").\n    - **Misspellings:** Correct common misspellings using this list:\n        - \"cherrys\" → cherries (fruit)\n        - \"strawberrys\" → strawberries (fruit)\n        - \"cranberrys\" → cranberries (fruit)\n        - \"raspberrys\" → raspberries (fruit)\n        - \"blueberrys\" → blueberries (fruit)\n        - \"butterflys\" → butterflies (animal/insect)\n    - **Compound Terms:** If an item appears to be a combination (e.g., \"elderberryoranges\"), treat it as a single entity. Use context to categorize (e.g., likely fruit).\n4.  **Follow These Steps:** Your response MUST follow this procedure:\n    a.  **Extract:** List every single item owned by \"I\" and its corresponding final quantity. Present this list clearly.\n    b.  **Categorize:** Place each item into the correct category as per the question. Exclude any item that doesn't fit the specified categories.\n    c.  **Sum:** Calculate the sum for each category separately. Add numbers carefully and verify your addition by summing twice to prevent arithmetic errors.\n    d.  **Compute:** Perform the final requested operation on these sums (e.g., add them, find the absolute difference).\n5.  **Show Your Work:** Present your extraction and calculations clearly before giving the final answer.\n\n**Examples of Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n- Example 1: When asked for \"mobiles and cars,\" do not include animals or fruits.\n- Example 2: \"iPhone\" is a mobile, not a fruit, even though it contains \"apple\".\n- Example 3: \"Cranberrys\" (misspelled) should be categorized as fruit.\n- Example 4: \"elderberryoranges\" should be treated as a single fruit item.\n- Example 5: Verify your sums carefully - arithmetic errors lead to wrong answers.\n\n**Question:** <The question will be inserted here>\n**Paragraph:** <The paragraph will be inserted here>",

You MUST ignore any object that does not perfectly fit the described category. Use the following definitions:\n    - **Musical instruments:** Devices created to make music (e.g., guitar, piano, drum, violin).\n    - **Fruits:** The sweet and fleshy product of a tree or plant that contains seed and can be eaten as food (e.g., apple, banana, mango).\n    - **Animals/insects:** All living creatures that are not humans (including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, insects, arachnids, etc.).\n    - **Cars:** Motor vehicles with four wheels designed for passenger transportation.\n    - **Mobiles:** Mobile phones or smartphones.\n    For other categories, use common sense and standard definitions.\n3.  **Handle Ambiguity Conservatively:** \n    - If an item's description is ambiguous (e.g., \"26 vibraphone, steelpans\"), interpret it as the total number applying to the entire mentioned group.

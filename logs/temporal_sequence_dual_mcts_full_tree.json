        "prompt": "You are an expert scheduling assistant. Your task is to analyze participants' weekly schedules and constraints to determine the longest possible meeting that can be scheduled this week, starting on the hour or half-hour.\n\n### Key Instructions:\n1. **Meeting Requirements**:\n   - The meeting must start on the **hour or half-hour** (e.g., 9:00, 9:30, 10:00, etc.).\n   - The meeting must occur within **working hours (9:00 to 17:00)** for all participants in their local time.\n   - All participants must be available for the **entire duration** of the meeting, unless a flexibility rule allows partial absence.\n\n2. **Handling Schedules**:\n   - For each participant, interpret their schedule as follows:\n     - \"Free only at the following times\": The participant is free **only** during these intervals (and booked otherwise).\n     - \"Booked at the following times\": The participant is booked **only** during these intervals (and free otherwise).\n   - Treat time intervals as **inclusive of the start time and exclusive of the end time** (e.g., [9:00, 10:00) means free from 9:00 up to but not including 10:00).\n   - If a participant has a flexibility rule (e.g., \"can clear their schedule from X to Y\"), modify their availability to be free during that interval, even if originally booked.\n\n3. **Time Zones**:\n   - If participants are in different time zones, convert all schedules to a **common time zone** (e.g., the time zone of the majority) before comparing availability. Shift times appropriately (e.g., subtract one hour for a participant who is one hour ahead).\n\n4. **Constraints**:\n   - For constraints like \"accepts new meetings on [days] only if [condition]\", interpret it as: **Meetings on [days] must satisfy [condition], but meetings on other days are allowed without this condition.** Do not assume the participant is unavailable on other days.\n   - For constraints like \"requires the meeting to end before X\", ensure the meeting ends before X (e.g., before 16:00 means the meeting must end by 15:59).\n   - For constraints like \"needs at least 10 minutes of free time before the meeting\", ensure the participant is free for the 10 minutes immediately preceding the meeting start time.\n   - For flexibility rules like \"can miss the last X minutes\", the participant must be available from the meeting start time until (end time minus X minutes). They may be absent for the remaining X minutes.\n\n5. **Approach**:\n   - For each day (Monday to Friday), determine if the day is valid based on constraints (e.g., if a participant only allows meetings on certain days with conditions, ensure the day is allowed and the condition is satisfied).\n   - For each valid day, consider all possible start times on the hour or half-hour between 9:00 and the latest start time allowed by end-time constraints.\n   - For each start time, determine the maximum possible meeting duration by finding the earliest time at which any participant becomes unavailable (accounting for flexibility rules and constraints).\n   - Apply all constraints to ensure the meeting is valid (e.g., duration conditions, free time before, etc.).\n   - Track the longest meeting length (X) and the number of start times that achieve this length (Y).\n\n6. **Output**:\n   - If no meeting is possible, output \"0, 0\".\n   - Otherwise, output \"X, Y\" where X is the length in minutes and Y is the number of distinct meeting options.\n\n### Examples for Guidance:\n- **Example 1**: Lisa only accepts meetings on Tuesday and Friday if they are at least 30 minutes long. This means meetings on Tuesday or Friday must be ≥30 min, but meetings on other days are allowed without this restriction. Charlotte only accepts meetings on Monday or Thursday if they are at most 60 minutes. Meetings on Monday or Thursday must be ≤60 min, but meetings on other days are allowed.\n- **Example 2**: When checking free intervals, ensure boundaries are handled correctly (e.g., if someone is free until 10:00, they are not free at 10:00).\n- **Example 3**: For flexibility rules like \"can clear their morning schedule from 9:00 to 9:45\", explicitly set the participant as free during that interval, overriding any bookings.\n- **Example 5**: For time zones, convert Lisa's schedule to common time by subtracting one hour from all her times.\n\nBy following these instructions carefully, you will avoid common pitfalls and ensure accurate scheduling results.",

For instance, if Alice has a booking from 10:00 to 10:20 (20 minutes), she can clear it, so treat that interval as free.\n- **Example 6 (Failure Avoidance)**: If a meeting must end before 16:00, the latest end time is 15:59. A meeting starting at 15:30 can have a maximum duration of 29 minutes, not 30.\n- **Example 7 (Failure Avoidance)**: For \"free time after the meeting\", ensure the participant is free from end_time to end_time+10 minutes.

If there is no common day across all participants, output \"0,0\".\n   - For each allowed day, compute the common free intervals for all participants.\n   - For each common free interval, consider all possible start times on the hour or half-hour within the interval.\n   - For each start time, determine the maximum possible meeting duration by finding the earliest time at which any participant becomes unavailable (accounting for flexibility rules and constraints like \"end before X\").\n   - Apply all constraints to ensure the meeting is valid (e.g., duration conditions, free time before/after, etc.).\n   - Track the longest meeting length (X) and the number of start times that achieve this length (Y).\n\n6. **Output**:\n   - If no meeting is possible, output \"0, 0\".\n   - Otherwise, output \"X, Y\" where X is the length in minutes (an integer) and Y is the number of distinct meeting options.\n\n### Examples for Guidance:\n- **Example 1**: Lisa only accepts meetings on Tuesday and Friday if they are at least 30 minutes long. This means meetings are only allowed on Tuesday or Friday, and must be ≥30 min. Meetings on other days are not allowed.\n- **Example 2**: When converting time zones, subtract 1 hour for a participant who is one hour ahead. For example, if a participant has a free interval [10:00, 12:00) in their local time (one hour ahead), in common time it becomes [9:00, 11:00). Then clip to [9:00, 17:00).\n- **Example 3**: For \"can clear their morning schedule from 9:00 to 9:45\", set the participant as free during [9:00, 9:45) even if originally booked.\n- **Example 4**: For \"end before 16:00\", the meeting must end before 16:00 (so end time <16:00). The latest possible end time is 15:59.\n- **Example 5**: For \"can miss the last 10 minutes\", if a meeting lasts 15 minutes, the participant must be available for the first 5 minutes (since 15 - 10 = 5). If the meeting lasts 5 minutes, they must be available for the entire meeting.\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:\n- Do not assume a participant is available on days not mentioned in their \"accepts meetings\" constraint; they are unavailable.\n- After time zone conversion, ensure all intervals are within [9:00, 17:00) in common time.\n- For \"free only\" and \"booked only\", remember the participant's status outside the listed intervals.\n- Apply flexibility rules unconditionally to override the original schedule.\n- For \"free time after\", the interval [end, end+10) must be within [9:00, 17:00). If end+10 > 17:00, it is invalid.\n- When applying \"can miss the last T minutes\", if the meeting duration is less than T, the participant must be free for the entire meeting.\n- Always check that the meeting duration satisfies any conditions imposed by constraints (e.g., ≥30 min or ≤60 min).\n\n### Failure Examples and Solutions:\n- **Failure Example 1**: In a previous attempt, the model did not properly handle Mary's rule to clear meetings of ≤30 minutes. Solution: Explicitly scan all bookings and remove those with duration ≤30.\n- **Failure Example 2**: The model sometimes ended meetings exactly at the constraint time (e.g., 16:00 for \"end before 16:00\"). Solution: Ensure end time is strictly less than the constraint time.\n- **Failure Example 3**: The model considered invalid start times (e.g., 14:45). Solution: Only consider start times on the hour or half-hour.\n- **Failure Example 4**: The model missed the intersection of allowed days. Solution: First determine the set of allowed days for each participant, then find the common days.\n\nBy following these instructions carefully, you will avoid common pitfalls and ensure accurate scheduling results.",

Specifically:\n        - For participants who must be present for the entire meeting, their next booking after the start time limits the end time.\n        - For participants who can miss the last X minutes, they must be free until (end time - X minutes).\n   - Apply all constraints to ensure the meeting is valid (e.g., duration conditions, free time before, etc.).\n   - Track the longest meeting length (X) and the number of start times that achieve this length (Y).\n\n6. **Output**:\n   - If no meeting is possible, output \"0, 0\".\n   - Otherwise, output \"X, Y\" where X is the length in minutes and Y is the number of distinct meeting options.\n\n### Examples for Guidance:\n- **Example 1**: Lisa only accepts meetings on Tuesday and Friday if they are at least 30 minutes long.

For example, [9:00, 10:00) means free from 9:00 inclusive to 10:00 exclusive.\n   - Ignore zero-duration intervals (e.g., \"from 10:05 to 10:05\").\n\n3. **Apply Participant Constraints**:\n   - **Clearing short meetings**: If a participant can \"clear any meeting of X minutes or less,\" check each of their busy intervals. If the duration of a busy interval is ≤ X minutes, treat that interval as free. Otherwise, it remains busy.\n   - **Missing part of the meeting**:\n     - \"Miss the first Y minutes\": The participant can join the meeting after Y minutes. The meeting must include them from (start + Y) to end.\n     - \"Miss the last Y minutes\": The participant can leave Y minutes early. They must be present from start to (end - Y).\n   - **End time restrictions**: \"End before 4 PM\" means the meeting must end by 15:59.\n   - **Stay late**: \"Stay until 6 PM\" means their workday extends to 18:00.\n   - **Day-specific constraints**: If a participant only accepts meetings on certain days or with certain durations, respect these rules.\n\n4. **Determine Feasible Days**:\n   - Consider only weekdays (Monday to Friday).\n   - First, eliminate days that violate day-specific constraints (e.g., a participant only allows meetings on Tuesday and Friday).\n\n5. **Find Available Intervals**:\n   - For each remaining day, compute the free intervals for each participant (after applying constraints and time zone adjustments).\n   - Find all overlapping intervals where all participants are free simultaneously.\n   - Within these overlapping intervals, identify segments that allow a meeting start on the hour or half-hour.\n\n6. **Compute Maximum Duration**:\n   - For each valid start time (on the hour or half-hour), determine the latest end time such that:\n     - All participants remain free for the entire duration (considering constraints like missing minutes).\n     - The meeting does not violate any end time restrictions.\n   - The duration is (end time - start time) in minutes.\n\n7. **Output**:\n   - Let X be the maximum duration (in minutes) found across all days and start times.\n   - Let Y be the number of start times (on the hour or half-hour) that achieve this duration.\n   - Report \"X, Y\". If no meeting is possible, report \"0, 0\".\n\n### Examples for Guidance (Avoid These Mistakes):\n- **Example 1**: When converting time zones, ensure all schedules are aligned to the common time zone. For instance, if Mary is one hour ahead, her 9:00-10:00 becomes 8:00-9:00 in common time, but since work starts at 9:00, only [9:00, 9:00) is relevant.\n- **Example 2**: For \"miss the last 10 minutes,\" the participant must be free from the start time until (end time - 10 minutes). Do not allow them to miss time at the start.\n- **Example 3**: When checking clearing of short meetings, only clear busy intervals that are ≤ the specified duration. Longer intervals remain busy.\n- **Example 4**: For day-specific constraints, ensure the meeting day is allowed and the duration requirement is met.\n- **Example 5**: Carefully handle half-open intervals. For instance, if a participant is free until 10:00, they are not free at 10:00.\n\n### Final Answer Format:\nOnly output the final answer as \"X, Y\".

If no meeting is possible, report \"0, 0\".\n\n### Key Reasoning Strategies (Critical for Success):\n- **Pre-meeting free time**: For start time S, the participant must be free in [max(work_start, S-10), S). If S = work_start, no pre-meeting time is required.\n- **Half-open intervals**: The end time is exclusive. A meeting ending at E is valid only if all participants are free until E.\n- **Systematic day analysis**: Process each day separately. For long meetings, prioritize days with large contiguous free intervals.\n- **Constraint verification**: Check all constraints (e.g., pre-free, missing minutes) for each candidate start time.\n\n### Examples for Guidance:\n- **Example 1**: When converting time zones, align all schedules to common time. Mary (one hour ahead) has 9:00-10:00 become 8:00-9:00 in common time, but her work starts at 9:00, so only [9:00, 9:00) is relevant.\n- **Example 2**: For \"miss the last 10 minutes,\" the participant must be free from start to (end - 10). Do not allow missing time at the start.\n- **Example 3**: Sarah requires 10 minutes free before a meeting. For S=13:00, she must be free in [12:50, 13:00). If she is only free from 12:55, this fails.\n\n### Final Answer Format:\nOnly output the final answer as \"X, Y\". For example, \"60, 1\".\n\nNow, process the input and provide the answer.",

If no meeting is possible, report \"0, 0\".\n\n### Key Reasoning Strategies (Critical for Success):\n- **Process each day separately**: Analyze all days independently to find the global maximum.\n- **Constraint order**: Apply time zone → schedule interpretation → participant constraints → overlap finding.\n- **Maximize duration**: For each start time, extend the meeting to the earliest end time constrained by any participant (considering missing minutes and other rules).\n- **Discrete start times**: Only evaluate start times on the hour or half-hour.\n\n### Examples for Guidance:\n- **Same time zone**: If no differences mentioned, no conversion needed.\n- **Pre-meeting at work start**: For S=9:00, pre-meeting time [9:00,9:00) is valid.\n- **Missing minutes**: For \"miss last 10 minutes\", the participant must be free until (end - 10).\n- **Day-specific limits**: Even if free intervals are longer, respect duration constraints (e.g., max 60 minutes on certain days).\n\n### Final Answer Format:\nOnly output \"X, Y\" (e.g., \"150, 1\").",

Your task is to determine the longest possible meeting that can be scheduled this week given participants' schedules and constraints. Follow these steps carefully:\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions:\n1. **Time Zone Handling**:\n   - Determine the common time zone (where most participants are located). Convert all schedules to this time zone by applying time differences.\n   - Example: If a participant is one hour ahead, subtract 1 hour from their schedule times.\n\n2. **Interpret Schedules**:\n   - \"Free only at\": The participant is free only during these intervals; all other times during their workday are busy.\n   - \"Booked at\": The participant is busy only during these intervals; all other times during their workday are free.\n   - All time intervals are half-open: [start, end). For example, [9:00, 10:00) means free from 9:00 inclusive to 10:00 exclusive.\n   - Ignore zero-duration intervals (e.g., \"from 10:05 to 10:05\").\n\n3. **Apply Participant Constraints**:\n   - **Clearing short meetings**: If a participant can \"clear any meeting of X minutes or less,\" check each busy interval. If its duration ≤ X, treat it as free. Only applies to intervals entirely within the specified window.\n   - **Missing part of the meeting**:\n     - \"Miss the first Y minutes\": The participant must be free from (start + Y) to end.\n     - \"Miss the last Y minutes\": The participant must be free from start to (end - Y).\n   - **End time restrictions**: \"End before 4 PM\" means the meeting must end by 15:59.\n   - **Stay late**: \"Stay until 6 PM\" extends their workday to 18:00.\n   - **Day-specific constraints**: Respect rules like \"only on Tuesday\" or \"minimum duration Z.\"\n   - **Pre-meeting free time**: If a participant requires free time before the meeting, ensure they are free in [max(work_start, S-10), S) for a start time S.\n\n4. **Determine Feasible Days**:\n   - Consider only weekdays (Monday to Friday).\n   - Eliminate days that violate day-specific constraints.\n\n5. **Find Available Intervals**:\n   - For each remaining day, compute free intervals for each participant (after time zone adjustments and constraints).\n   - Find all overlapping intervals where all participants are free simultaneously.\n   - Within these overlaps, identify segments that allow a meeting start on the hour or half-hour.\n\n6. **Compute Maximum Duration**:\n   - For each valid start time (on the hour or half-hour), determine the latest end time such that:\n     - All participants remain free for the entire duration (considering constraints like missing minutes).\n     - The meeting does not violate any end time restrictions.\n   - The duration is (end time - start time) in minutes.\n\n7. **Output**:\n   - Let X be the maximum duration (in minutes) found across all days and start times.\n   - Let Y be the number of start times (on the hour or half-hour) that achieve this duration.\n   - Report \"X, Y\". If no meeting is possible, report \"0, 0\".\n\n### Key Reasoning Strategies (Critical for Success):\n- **Systematic day analysis**: Process each day separately. For long meetings, prioritize days with large contiguous free intervals.\n- **Pre-meeting free time**: For start time S, the participant must be free in [max(work_start, S-10), S). If S = work_start, no pre-meeting time is required.\n- **Half-open intervals**: The end time is exclusive. A meeting ending at E is valid only if all participants are free until E.\n- **Constraint verification**: Check all constraints (e.g., pre-free, missing minutes, day-specific rules) for each candidate start time.\n- **Duration limits**: Apply day-specific min/max duration constraints when evaluating meetings.\n\n### Examples for Guidance:\n- **Example 1**: When converting time zones, align all schedules to common time. Mary (one hour ahead) has 9:00-10:00 become 8:00-9:00 in common time, but her work starts at 9:00, so only [9:00, 9:00) is relevant.\n- **Example 2**: For \"miss the last 10 minutes,\" the participant must be free from start to (end - 10). Do not allow missing time at the start.\n- **Example 3**: Sarah requires 10 minutes free before a meeting. For S=13:00, she must be free in [12:50, 13:00). If she is only free from 12:55, this fails.\n- **Example 4**: On days with max duration constraints (e.g., ≤60 minutes), even if a longer meeting is technically possible, it is invalid.\n\n### Final Answer Format:\nOnly output the final answer as \"X, Y\".

When evaluating a specific meeting of duration D ≤ X, you may treat any of their busy intervals with duration ≤ X as free for that meeting. Do not preemptively clear intervals for all meetings.\n   - **Missing part of the meeting**:\n     - \"Miss the first Y minutes\": The participant must be free from (start time + Y) to end time. They do not need to be free at the start time itself.\n     - \"Miss the last Y minutes\": The participant must be free from start time to (end time - Y). The meeting can end up to Y minutes after their free interval ends, but they are only required to be present until (end time - Y).\n   - **End time restrictions**: \"End before 4 PM\" means the meeting must end by 15:59.\n   - **Stay late**: \"Stay until 6 PM\" means their workday extends to 18:00.\n   - **Free time before/after meeting**: If a participant requires free time before or after, this is a hard constraint. For example, \"has at least 10 minutes free before\" means the meeting cannot start at S unless they are free during [S-10, S).\n   - **Day-specific constraints**: If a participant only accepts meetings on certain days or with certain durations, respect these rules.\n\n4. **Determine Feasible Days**:\n   - Consider only weekdays (Monday to Friday).\n   - First, eliminate days that violate day-specific constraints (e.g., a participant only allows meetings on Tuesday and Friday).\n\n5. **Find the Longest Meeting**:\n   - Iterate through each feasible day.\n   - For each day, iterate through every potential meeting start time S that is on the hour or half-hour (e.g., 9:00, 9:30, 10:00, ...), within the common workday.\n   - For each start time S:\n     - For each participant, calculate their effective latest possible end time E_p for a meeting starting at S, considering:\n        - Their free intervals (after time zone and constraint adjustments)\n        - Their \"miss minutes\" constraints (e.g., for \"miss last Y\", E_p can be up to B + Y where B is the end of their free interval, but they must be free from S to E_p - Y)\n        - Their personal end-time restrictions (e.g., \"end before 4pm\")\n        - Their required free time after the meeting\n     - The overall latest possible end time E is the minimum of all participants' E_p values.\n     - The duration for start time S is E - S (in minutes). If E - S is negative or violates a constraint (e.g., is less than a required minimum duration), discard this start time.\n   - Track the maximum duration X found across all days and all start times.\n   - Count how many start times (across all days) achieve this maximum duration X; this is Y.\n\n6. **Output**:\n   - Report \"X, Y\".

A meeting from S to E requires participants to be free for [S, E).\n\n### Examples to Avoid Common Mistakes:\n- **Example 1**: If a participant can \"miss the last 10 minutes,\" do not simply extend their free intervals. Instead, ensure they are free from S to E-10, and E can be up to 10 minutes after their free interval ends.\n- **Example 2**: When handling \"clear any meeting of 30 minutes or less,\" only clear busy intervals if the meeting being considered is ≤30 minutes. For longer meetings, use the original schedule.\n- **Example 3**: For \"has at least 10 minutes free before,\" the meeting cannot start at S unless the participant is free during [S-10, S). This must be checked for each start time.\n- **Example 4**: When converting time zones, adjust both the schedule intervals and the workday boundaries. A participant working 9-5 local time who is one hour ahead has a workday of 8-4 in common time.\n\nNow, process the input and provide the answer.",

Do not assume a day is infeasible without checking availability.\n\n5. **Find Available Intervals**:\n   - For each remaining day, compute the free intervals for each participant (after applying constraints and time zone adjustments).\n   - Find all overlapping intervals where all participants are free simultaneously.\n   - Within these overlapping intervals, identify segments that allow a meeting start on the hour or half-hour.\n\n6. **Compute Maximum Duration**:\n   - For each valid start time (on the hour or half-hour), determine the latest end time such that:\n        - All participants remain free for the entire duration (considering constraints like missing minutes).\n        - The meeting does not violate any end time restrictions.\n   - The duration is (end time - start time) in minutes.\n\n7. **Output**:\n   - Let X be the maximum duration (in minutes) found across all days and start times.\n   - Let Y be the number of start times (on the hour or half-hour) that achieve this duration.\n   - Report \"X, Y\". If no meeting is possible after checking all days, report \"0, 0\".\n\n### Key Reasoning Strategies (Critical for Success):\n- **Iterate over days**: Process each day separately. Only eliminate a day if it is explicitly invalid due to constraints.\n- **Adjust for constraints early**: Apply time zone conversions and participant constraints before computing free intervals.\n- **Effective free intervals for missing minutes**: For participants who can miss the last Y minutes, treat their free intervals as allowing meetings to end at B + Y, but ensure they are free from start to (end - Y).\n- **Overlap calculation**: Compute the intersection of free intervals for all participants to find common availability. Consider using a timeline for clarity.\n- **Start time validation**: Only consider start times on the hour or half-hour within overlapping free intervals.\n- **End time limitation**: The end time is limited by the most restrictive participant (considering free intervals, constraints, and workday boundaries).\n- **Post-meeting constraints**: Check if participants require free time after the meeting (e.g., at least 10 minutes free within workday).\n\n### Examples of Common Mistakes to Avoid:\n- **Example 1**: If a participant is one hour ahead, their workday in common time shifts. For example, 9:00-17:00 local becomes 8:00-16:00 common time. Do not use the original workday boundaries.\n- **Example 2**: For \"free only at\", the participant is busy outside the listed intervals. For \"booked at\", they are free outside the listed intervals. Do not confuse these.\n- **Example 3**: When a participant can \"clear short meetings\", only clear busy intervals ≤ X minutes. Longer intervals remain busy.\n- **Example 4**: For \"miss the last Y minutes\", the participant must be free from start to (end - Y). The meeting can end at B + Y, but they are not required to be free beyond B.\n- **Example 5**: Day-specific constraints are absolute. If a participant only accepts meetings on certain days, other days are invalid for that participant.\n\nNow, process the input and provide the answer.",

For example, [9:00, 10:00) means free from 9:00 inclusive to 10:00 exclusive.\n   - Ignore zero-duration intervals (e.g., \"from 10:05 to 10:05\").\n\n3. **Apply Participant Constraints**:\n   - **Clearing short meetings**: If a participant can \"clear any meeting of X minutes or less,\" check each of their busy intervals. If the duration of a busy interval is ≤ X minutes, treat that interval as free. Otherwise, it remains busy.\n   - **Missing part of the meeting**:\n     - \"Miss the first Y minutes\": The participant must be present from (start + Y) to end.\n     - \"Miss the last Y minutes\": The participant must be present from start to (end - Y). For this, the effective end of their free interval is extended by Y minutes (i.e., meeting can end at B + Y, where B is the end of the free interval), but they must be free from start to (end - Y).\n   - **End time restrictions**: \"End before 4 PM\" means the meeting must end by 15:59.\n   - **Stay late**: \"Stay until 6 PM\" means their workday extends to 18:00.\n   - **Day-specific constraints**: If a participant only accepts meetings on certain days or with certain durations, respect these rules.\n\n4. **Determine Feasible Days**:\n   - Consider only weekdays (Monday to Friday).\n   - First, eliminate days that violate day-specific constraints (e.g., a participant only allows meetings on Tuesday and Friday).\n\n5. **Find Available Intervals**:\n   - For each remaining day, compute the free intervals for each participant (after applying constraints and time zone adjustments).\n   - Find all overlapping intervals where all participants are free simultaneously.\n   - Within these overlapping intervals, identify segments that allow a meeting start on the hour or half-hour.\n\n6. **Compute Maximum Duration**:\n   - For each valid start time (on the hour or half-hour), determine the latest end time such that:\n     - All participants remain free for the entire duration (considering constraints like missing minutes).\n     - The meeting does not violate any end time restrictions.\n   - The duration is (end time - start time) in minutes.\n\n7. **Output**:\n   - Let X be the maximum duration (in minutes) found across all days and start times.\n   - Let Y be the number of start times (on the hour or half-hour) that achieve this duration.\n   - Report \"X, Y\".

The meeting must include them from (start + Y) to end.\n     - \"Miss the last Y minutes\": The participant can leave Y minutes early.

If no meeting is possible, report \"0, 0\".\n\n### Key Reasoning Strategies (Critical for Success):\n- **Process each day independently**, applying all constraints and computing free intervals for each participant.\n- **Intersect free intervals systematically** to find common availability.\n- **Only consider start times on the hour or half-hour** (e.g., 9:00, 9:30, 10:00).\n- **Apply constraints during duration calculation**: For example, if a participant can miss the last 10 minutes, ensure they are free from start to (end - 10).\n- **Check end-time restrictions rigorously**: e.g., if a participant requires 10 minutes free after, the meeting must end by (17:00 - 10 minutes) = 16:50.\n- **Compare results across all days** to find the global maximum duration and count.\n\n### Examples for Guidance (Avoid These Mistakes):\n- **Example 1**: When converting time zones, ensure all schedules are aligned to the common time zone. For instance, if Mary is one hour ahead, her 9:00-10:00 becomes 8:00-9:00 in common time, but since work starts at 9:00, only [9:00, 9:00) is relevant.\n- **Example 2**: For \"miss the last 10 minutes,\" the participant must be free from the start time until (end time - 10 minutes). Do not allow them to miss time at the start.\n- **Example 3**: When checking clearing of short meetings, only clear busy intervals that are ≤ the specified duration. Longer intervals remain busy.\n- **Example 4**: For day-specific constraints, ensure the meeting day is allowed and the duration requirement is met.\n- **Example 5**: Carefully handle half-open intervals. For instance, if a participant is free until 10:00, they are not free at 10:00.\n\n### Final Answer Format:\nOnly output the final answer as \"X, Y\".

Adjust by subtracting or adding the time difference.\n   - After conversion, intersect each participant's availability with the common working hours [9:00, 17:00) in the common timezone. If their converted availability starts before 9:00, cap it at 9:00; if it ends after 17:00, cap it at 17:00. However, since the meeting must end before 16:00, further cap the end time at 16:00 where necessary.\n\n2. **Free Time Intervals**:\n   - For each participant, extract free intervals during working hours [9:00, 17:00). Treat intervals as half-open [start, end), meaning the end time is exclusive (e.g., free until 10:00 means available at 9:59 but not at 10:00).\n   - Apply clearing rules: if a participant can \"clear\" a time block (e.g., clear 9:00–9:45), treat that block as free, provided the block duration is within the clearable limit.\n   - Mark any special unavailable intervals (e.g., lunch breaks) as busy.\n\n3. **Day Selection**:\n   - Focus only on days where all participants can potentially meet, considering day-specific constraints (e.g., \"only accepts meetings on Tuesdays and Fridays\").\n\n4. **Meeting Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start strictly on the hour or half-hour (e.g., 9:00, 9:30, 10:00, ..., 15:30).\n   - The meeting must end strictly before 16:00 (i.e., by 15:59).

If no meeting is possible, output \"0, 0\".\n\n### Examples to Avoid Common Mistakes:\n\n- **Example 1 (Timezone Capping)**: Zoey is 1 hour ahead. Convert her schedule to common time by subtracting 1 hour. Her local working hours are 9:00–17:00, so in common time, she is available from 8:00 to 16:00. However, cap her availability to [9:00, 16:00) in common time since the meeting must end before 16:00.\n- **Example 2 (Missed Time)**: Nancy can clear any meeting ≤30 minutes. If she has a booked block of 5 minutes (e.g., 11:35–11:40), clear it to free. Zoey can miss the last 10 minutes: for a meeting from S to S+D, she must be free from S to S+D-10.\n- **Example 3 (End Time)**: A meeting starting at 15:30 can last at most 29 minutes (ending at 15:59). A 30-minute meeting starting at 15:30 would end at 16:00, which is invalid.\n- **Example 4 (Free Time Before)**: Sarah requires 10 minutes free before the meeting. For a start time S, she must be free during [S-10, S). If S=9:00, this requires free time before 9:00, which is impossible, so S=9:00 is invalid.\n- **Example 5 (Complex Constraints)**: With 6 participants, compute free intervals for each first, then find overlaps. Apply lunch breaks (e.g., Olivia unavailable 12:30–13:00 on Wednesday) and day restrictions (e.g., Lisa only accepts meetings ≤60 minutes on Mondays and Thursdays).\n\nNow, process the input and output \"X, Y\".",

If D ≤ M, they must be present for the entire meeting.\n        - If a participant can \"miss at most M minutes\", they must have a contiguous free block of length at least D - M within [S, S+D].\n   - Apply other constraints rigorously (e.g., \"must have 10 minutes free before the meeting\" means the participant must be free during [S-10, S)).\n\n5. **Finding Valid Meetings**:\n   - For each eligible day, iterate over all start times on the hour or half-hour between 9:00 and 15:30.\n   - For each start time S, determine the maximum meeting length D that satisfies:\n        - D ≤ D_time (to end by 15:59).\n        - For each participant, they are available for the entire duration [S, S+D) considering any allowances for missed time (as above).\n        - Any other constraints are met (e.g., day-specific length constraints, free time before/after).\n   - Track the maximum length X and the count Y of start times that achieve X.\n\n6. **Output**:\n   - Report \"X, Y\". If no meeting is possible, output \"0, 0\".\n\n### Examples to Avoid Common Mistakes:\n\n- **Example 1 (Timezone Capping)**: Zoey is 1 hour ahead. Convert her schedule to common time by subtracting 1 hour. Her local working hours are 9:00–17:00, so in common time, she is available from 8:00 to 16:00. Cap her availability to [9:00, 16:00) in common time.\n- **Example 2 (Missed Time)**: Nancy can clear any meeting ≤30 minutes. If she has a booked block of 5 minutes, clear it to free. Zoey can miss the last 10 minutes: for a meeting from S to S+D, she must be free from S to S+D-10.\n- **Example 3 (End Time)**: A meeting starting at 15:30 can last at most 29 minutes (ending at 15:59). A 30-minute meeting starting at 15:30 would end at 16:00, which is invalid.\n- **Example 4 (Free Time Before)**: Sarah requires 10 minutes free before the meeting. For S=9:00, this requires free time before 9:00, which is impossible.\n- **Example 5 (Day Restrictions)**: Lisa only accepts meetings on Mondays and Thursdays if they are ≤60 minutes. This means if the meeting is on Monday or Thursday, it must be ≤60 minutes; meetings on other days are allowed without this constraint.\n\nNow, process the input and output \"X, Y\".",

Follow these structured steps to find the longest possible meeting length (X) and the number of valid start times (Y) where the meeting starts on the hour or half-hour.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions:\n\n1. **Timezone Alignment**:\n   - If participants are in different timezones, convert all schedules to a common timezone (e.g., the timezone of the majority). Adjust by subtracting or adding the time difference.\n   - After conversion, intersect each participant's availability with the common working hours [9:00, 16:00) in the common timezone. This means:\n        - If their converted availability starts before 9:00, cap it at 9:00.\n        - If it ends after 16:00, cap it at 16:00 (since the meeting must end before 16:00).\n   - Example: Eve is 1 hour ahead. Her local working hours are 9:00–17:00, so in common time, she is available from 8:00 to 16:00. After capping, her availability is [9:00, 16:00).\n\n2. **Free Time Intervals**:\n   - For each participant, extract free intervals during working hours [9:00, 16:00). Treat intervals as half-open [start, end), meaning the end time is exclusive.\n   - Apply clearing rules: if a participant can \"clear\" a time block (e.g., clear 9:00–9:45), and that block is currently booked, treat it as free, provided the block duration is within the clearable limit.\n   - Mark any special unavailable intervals (e.g., lunch breaks) as busy, even if the schedule says free.\n   - Represent times in minutes past 9:00 for easier calculation (e.g., 9:00 = 0, 10:00 = 60, ..., 16:00 = 420). The meeting must end by 15:59 (419 minutes).\n   - Merge overlapping free intervals for each participant.\n\n3. **Day Selection**:\n   - Focus only on days where all participants can potentially meet, considering day-specific constraints (e.g., \"only accepts meetings on Tuesdays and Fridays\"). Ignore other days.\n\n4. **Meeting Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start strictly on the hour or half-hour (e.g., 9:00, 9:30, 10:00, ..., 15:30).\n   - The meeting must end strictly before 16:00 (i.e., by 15:59). Therefore, for a start time S (in minutes from 9:00), the maximum duration due to time is D_time = 419 - S.\n   - All participants must be fully available for the entire meeting duration unless explicitly allowed to miss time:\n        - If a participant can \"miss the last M minutes,\" they must be present from the start time S to (S + D - M).\n        - If a participant can \"miss at most M minutes,\" they must be present for a contiguous segment of length at least (D - M). Assume this segment is at the end for simplicity (i.e., they can miss the last M minutes).\n   - Apply other constraints rigorously (e.g., \"must have 10 minutes free before the meeting\" means the participant must be free during [S-10, S); similarly for after).\n\n5. **Finding Valid Meetings**:\n   - For each eligible day, compute the intersection of all participants' free intervals. This gives the common free intervals for that day.\n   - Iterate over all start times on the hour or half-hour between 9:00 and 15:30 (i.e., S in {0, 30, 60, ..., 390}).\n   - For each start time S, determine the maximum meeting length D that satisfies:\n        - D ≤ D_time (to end by 15:59).\n        - The entire interval [S, S+D) is within the common free intervals (considering any allowances for missed time).\n        - Any other constraints are met (e.g., pre-meeting free time).\n   - Track the maximum length X and the count Y of start times that achieve X.\n\n6. **Output**:\n   - Report \"X, Y\".

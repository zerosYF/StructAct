    "prompt": "You are an expert analyst in causal attribution and intentionality. Carefully reason through each question by following these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Effect:** Precisely define the specific outcome being asked about. Pay close attention to modifiers (e.g., \"premature death,\" \"because of\") which refine the effect.\n2.  **Map the Conditions:** List all known factors, rules, and their logical relationships (e.g., Effect requires A AND B, or Effect occurs if A OR B).\n3.  **Apply Causal Tests:**\n    *   **Tailored Counterfactual Test:** For each factor, ask: \"If this factor were absent or negated, would the specific effect (considering timing/manner) still have occurred?\"\n    *   **Causal Structure Check:** Determine if the scenario involves:\n        - **Conjunction (AND):** The effect requires multiple factors. Each necessary factor is a cause.\n        - **Overdetermination (OR):** Multiple factors are individually sufficient. Each sufficient factor is a cause, even if not counterfactually necessary.\n    *   **Normative Deviance:** Identify if any action violated a rule. A deviant action is often the primary cause, but normative actions can still be causal factors.\n4.  **Analyze Intent (if applicable):** For questions about intention, determine if the agent knew a side effect was certain. If so, it is intentional.\n5.  **Synthesize:** An event is a cause if it was an actual and sufficient factor (in overdetermination) or a necessary component of a sufficient set (in conjunction). The \"because of\" question often points to the decisive factor—the one that introduced uncertainty or was the proximate trigger. Causation is distinct from blameworthiness; normative or unintentional actions can still be causes.\n\n**Key Principles from Examples:**\n- In conjunction, all necessary factors are causes. The decisive factor is often the uncertain one.\n- In overdetermination, all sufficient factors are causes. The proximate trigger is often the focus.\n- A deviant action may preempt a normative one, but normative actions can still be causal.\n\nNow, apply this framework rigorously to the new question.

A deviant action is often the primary cause, while a normative action that completes a preempted chain may not be.\n4.  **Analyze Intent (if applicable):** For questions about intention, determine if the agent knew a side effect was certain to occur. If they acted with that knowledge, the effect can be considered intentional.\n5.  **Synthesize:** Weigh the results of the tests above. An event is a cause if it was an actual, sufficient factor. The cause is often the deviant or preempting factor. A side effect is intentional if it was foreseen as certain.\n\nReview the following examples to understand how to apply this reasoning:\n\n**Example 1:**\n**Input:** [Board Game Scenario]\n**Reasoning:** The effect is winning. The dice roll (>2) and the spinner (green) are both sufficient causes. This is a case of **overdetermination**. The counterfactual test fails here. Since the spinner landing on green was an actual and sufficient factor, it is a cause. The deviant or normative context does not apply.\n**Correct Output:** <answer>Yes</answer>\n\n**Example 2:**\n**Input:** [Hunter Scenario]\n**Reasoning:** The effect is shooting the bird-watcher. The hunter's action had two certain effects: killing the deer and hitting a bird-watcher. While his primary intention was to kill the deer, he knew hitting a bird-watcher was **certain**. Under the principle of double effect, an agent intends all foreseen certain consequences of their act.\n**Correct Output:** <answer>Yes</answer>\n\n**Example 3:**\n**Input:** [Central Computer Scenario]\n**Reasoning:** The effect is the email being sent. Zoe's login at 9 am was a **deviant** action that violated policy and created the dangerous situation. Alice's login at 9:30 am was **normative** (following policy). While her login was a necessary condition to complete the chain of events, Zoe's deviant action is the preempting and primary **actual cause**.

(This ignores that the spinner was a preempted sufficient cause).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The spinner landing on green was a sufficient condition for victory and did occur. Therefore, it is correct to say it was *a* cause, even though it was preempted by the dice roll. Answer: Yes.\n\n**Example 2 (Intentionality):**\n*   **Question:** Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** His goal was to win, so harming the bird-watcher was not intentional. (This ignores the principle of intentionality for known side-effects).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The hunter knew the harmful outcome was certain and acted anyway. Therefore, the harmful side-effect is judged to be intentional. Answer: Yes.\n\n**Example 3 (Normative Context):**\n*   **Question:** Did Alice cause the email to be sent?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** But for Alice's login, the email would not have been sent, so she caused it. (This ignores the normative context that Zoe violated the policy).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** While Alice's action was the proximate trigger, Zoe's violation of the policy is the deviant event that set the necessary conditions for the outcome.

Follow these steps precisely:\n\n1.  **Identify the key elements:** Determine the outcome in question and the potential causes or actions being considered.\n2.  **Distinguish Causation from Responsibility:** Remember that identifying a causal factor is different from assigning blame or moral/legal responsibility. An event can be a cause even if the actor was not obligated to prevent it.\n3.  **Apply the counterfactual test:** For any potential cause, ask \"If this event had not occurred, would the outcome still have happened?\"\n    *   If the outcome would **not** have occurred without it, then it is a necessary cause.\n    *   If the outcome **would** have occurred without it, then it is not a necessary cause.\n4.  **Consider causal preemption:** Even if an event was not necessary because another sufficient cause was present, it can still be considered *a* cause if it was itself a sufficient condition for the outcome and actually occurred.\n5.  **Evaluate normative context:** If the scenario involves rules, policies, or standard procedures, a violation of the norm is a strong cue for identifying the **primary responsible agent**. However, do not use normative context to deny that an event was *a* cause altogether. An action that breaks a rule is often the salient cause, but another event may still be a causal contributor.\n6.  **Evaluate Abnormality:** Determine if any potential cause was abnormal, unexpected, or a deviation from the default course of events.

(This ignores that the spinner was a preempted sufficient cause).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The spinner landing on green was a sufficient condition for victory and did occur. Therefore, it is correct to say it was *a* cause, even though it was preempted by the dice roll. Answer: Yes.\n\n**Example 2 (Intentionality):**\n*   **Question:** Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** His goal was to win, so harming the bird-watcher was not intentional. (This ignores the principle of intentionality for known side-effects).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The hunter knew the harmful outcome was certain and acted anyway. Therefore, the harmful side-effect is judged to be intentional. Answer: Yes.\n\n**Example 3 (Normative Context & Causation vs. Responsibility):**\n*   **Question:** Did Alice cause the email to be sent?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** But for Alice's login, the email would not have been sent, so she caused it. (This ignores the normative context that makes Zoe's action the primary fault).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** Alice's action was a *causal* trigger. However, Zoe's violation of the policy is the *deviant and responsible* cause. In contexts asking for fault or responsibility, we focus on Zoe. For this question, which implies fault, the answer is No.\n*   **Answer: No**\n\n**Example 4 (Abnormality):**\n*   **Question:** Did the likely green draw cause the win?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The win required both draws, so the green draw was a cause. (This is true but misses the pragmatic use of \"cause\").\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** While the green draw was a necessary condition, it was highly expected and normal. The rare blue draw was the abnormal, surprising factor that actually made the difference.

This test only identifies necessity. Proceed to the next step.\n4.  **Consider causal preemption and sufficiency:** An event is **a cause** if it was itself a sufficient condition for the outcome and actually occurred. This applies to classic preemption (where one cause blocks another) and to cases of **multiple sufficient causes**, where more than one event independently satisfies the conditions for the outcome. If multiple sufficient causes occur, they are **all** valid causes of the outcome.\n5.  **Check for outcome specificity:** A cause must explain the *specific instance* of the outcome that occurred, not just a general outcome of that type. A cause of a *future* outcome is not necessarily the cause of an outcome that *already happened* due to a different, immediate cause.\n6.  **Evaluate normative context:** If the scenario involves rules, policies, or standard procedures, a violation of the norm is a strong cue for identifying the **primary responsible agent**. However, do not use normative context to deny that an event was *a* cause altogether. An action that breaks a rule is often the salient cause, but another event may still be a causal contributor.\n7.  **Evaluate Abnormality:** Determine if any potential cause was abnormal, unexpected, or a deviation from the default course of events. In conjunctive scenarios (where multiple factors are needed), the abnormal factor is often singled out as the primary cause.

Output Your Final Answer:** Choose between the provided options (Yes/No), ensuring it aligns with the synthesized reasoning above.\n\n**Review the following examples to understand common pitfalls and their corrections:**\n\n**Example 1 (Normative Context vs. Causation):**\n*   **Question:** Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Kate was not responsible, so her inaction did not cause the breakdown. (This incorrectly uses norms to deny causal contribution).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** Kate's inaction was counterfactually necessary for the breakdown. The normative context (she wasn't responsible) explains *why* she didn't act and assigns blame to Janet, but it does not erase the causal role of her omission. Answer: Yes.\n\n**Example 2 (Cautious Counterfactual & Salience):**\n*   **Question:** Did the hedgehog cause the problem?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The bear's actions alone were sufficient, so the hedgehog's actions were unnecessary and not a cause. (This assumes without evidence that the bear would have taken all the pencils the hedgehog took).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The hedgehog's norm-violating actions were salient and abnormal. The cautious counterfactual is: if the hedgehog had not taken the pencils it did, those specific pencils would have remained. It is plausible the polar bear could have used one. The hedgehog's deviant action is therefore a cause. Answer: Yes.\n\n**Example 3 (Overdetermination):**\n*   **Question:** Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The travel agency's arrival was sufficient and preempted the studio's arrival. (This misapplies preemption to a case of simultaneous causation).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** Both arrivals were sufficient and occurred simultaneously. This is a case of overdetermination. Both are causes. Answer: Yes.\n\n**Example 4 (Pragmatic Salience):**\n*   **Question:** Did Joe's first choice cause him to win?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The first choice was necessary, so it caused the win. (This ignores the pragmatic focus on the unlikely, salient event).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** While mechanically necessary, the first choice (green ball) was highly probable and thus not the decisive, salient factor. The win was contingent on the unlikely second choice (blue ball), which is the critical cause implied by the question. Answer: No.\n\nNow, answer the following question:",

The phrasing \"did X cause Y\" often implies the latter, especially when norms, roles, or expectations are present. Precisely define the outcome Y. Is it the general outcome or a specific instance of it (e.g., \"death\" vs. \"death at this exact moment from this specific cause\")? For attribution, the specific instance is often more relevant.\n\n**1. Identify Key Elements:** Determine the outcome in question and the potential causes or actions being considered.\n\n**2. Apply the Cautious Counterfactual Test:** For any potential cause, ask \"If this specific event had not occurred, would the outcome still have happened *in the exact way it did*?\"\n    *   Construct counterfactuals using only information provided in the scenario. Avoid assuming events would have unfolded identically unless explicitly supported.\n    *   For omissions (not doing X), the counterfactual is \"if the actor *had* done X, would Y have been different?\"\n    *   If the outcome would **not** have occurred without it, then it is a necessary cause.\n    *   If the outcome **would** have occurred without it, then it is not a necessary cause.\n    *   **Important:** A finding of 'not necessary' is not a final answer. Proceed to evaluate sufficiency and pragmatic factors.\n\n**3. Evaluate Causal Sufficiency & Redundancy:**\n    *   Even if an event was not necessary, it can still be *a* cause if it was itself a sufficient condition for the outcome.\n    *   **Preemption:** If a sufficient cause occurs first and actually brings about the outcome, later sufficient causes are preempted and are not considered causes *for that instance of the outcome*. The outcome is already settled.\n    *   **Simultaneous Sufficiency (Overdetermination):** If two or more sufficient causes occur simultaneously (before the outcome is triggered), **all are considered causes.** The outcome is overdetermined.\n    *   **Temporal Sequence Matters:** For outcomes like winning a bet, the event that **first satisfies the condition** is often the pragmatically attributed cause, even if later redundant events occur.\n\n**4.

Evaluate Normative Context:**\n    *   A violation of a rule, policy, or standard expectation is a very strong cue for *attributing blame or primary responsibility*.\n    *   **Crucially:** The *absence* of a normative violation does not erase causal contribution. An action can be morally permissible or even expected yet still be a necessary part of the causal chain. Use norms to assign primary responsibility, not to deny causation entirely.\n\n**6.

Otherwise, it is usually part of the background and not attributed as a cause.\n    *   The most **salient** or **abnormal** event is often singled out as the \"cause.\"\n\n**8. Synthesize Your Reasoning:** Weigh the results of the previous steps. For mechanistic questions, rely on counterfactuals and sufficiency. For attribution questions, you **must** integrate the results of Step 4 (Proximity) and Step 7 (Pragmatics) with the mechanistic analysis.

His inaction was not necessary, so it is not a cause. (This ignores that his conscious decision *not* to act after verifying the situation is a salient, intentional omission that pragmatically qualifies as a cause).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** While not mechanically necessary, Wayne's omission was a deliberate, salient action in the narrative. He checked and chose not to interfere. This makes it a pragmatically attributed cause of the charge remaining uninterrupted. Answer: Yes.\n\n**Example 2 (Temporal Preemption & Winning Conditions):**\n*   **Question:** Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The later 3-point shot was also sufficient and more dramatic, so the layup was not the cause. (This misapplies salience and ignores that the winning condition was fulfilled at the moment of the layup).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The layup was a sufficient cause that occurred first and actually satisfied the winning condition for the bet. The subsequent 3-pointer was redundant. The first sufficient cause to occur is the pragmatically attributed cause. Answer: Yes.\n\n**Example 3 (Intervening Cause & Proximity):**\n*   **Question:** Did John's job cause his premature death?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Without the job and the cancer, John wouldn't have been in the hospital for the fatal error, so the job caused his death. (This is a mechanistic view that ignores the novel, intervening proximate cause for attribution).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The job was a distal cause of his illness. The nurse's medication error was a novel, intervening proximate cause that directly led to his death at that specific moment. This breaks the chain of pragmatic attribution for the job. Answer: No.\n\n**Example 4 (Simultaneous Overdetermination vs. Default/Deviant):**\n*   **Question:** Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Both arrivals were sufficient and simultaneous, so both are causes. (This is a mechanistic view that ignores the pragmatic default/deviant distinction).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The travel agency's arrival was the normal, default, and expected sufficient cause for the system turning on at 8:45 am. The design studio's abnormal, deviant arrival was redundant for this outcome. Pragmatically, the outcome is attributed to the default cause, not the coincidental deviant one.

Your goal is to determine if actor X is appropriately considered *a* cause of outcome Y, distinguishing between mechanistic causation and pragmatic attribution. Follow these steps precisely:\n\n**0. Frame the Question:** First, determine if the question is primarily about identifying *any* causal factor (mechanistic) or identifying the *primary* or *most explanatory* cause (pragmatic attribution). The phrasing \"did X cause Y\" can be ambiguous. Look for keywords: questions about 'blame', 'credit', or 'reason' are attributional. Questions about 'how' or 'why' an outcome occurred can be either; use context.\n\n**1. Identify Key Elements:** Determine the outcome in question and the potential causes or actions being considered.\n\n**2. Apply the Cautious Counterfactual Test:** For any potential cause, ask \"If this specific event had not occurred, would the outcome still have happened in the way it did?\"\n    *   Construct counterfactuals using only information provided in the scenario.

Analyze Omissions in the Actual Sequence:** For an omission (not acting), ask: 'In the actual sequence of events, did the omission allow a causal process to continue that would have otherwise been stopped?' If yes, then the omission can be a cause within the actual sequence, even if the outcome was overdetermined by other potential pathways.\n\n**3. Evaluate Causal Redundancy (Preemption & Overdetermination):**\n    *   Even if an event was not necessary, it can still be *a* cause if it was itself a sufficient condition for the outcome.\n    *   **Preemption:** If a sufficient cause was preempted by another sufficient cause that occurred first and actually brought about the outcome, the preempted cause is typically not considered a cause *in that instance*.\n    *   **Simultaneous Sufficiency (Overdetermination):** If two or more sufficient causes occur simultaneously, **all are considered *mechanistic* causes.** However, for *pragmatic attribution*, the cause that is normal or expected is often seen as the default explanation, and the abnormal, redundant cause is not considered the 'reason' for the outcome.\n\n**3b. Evaluate Intervening Causes:** If a new, independent event occurs after the initial cause and directly produces the outcome, evaluate if it was a **foreseeable** consequence of the first cause. If the intervening cause is highly abnormal or unforeseeable (e.g., gross negligence, intentional malicious act), it may break the chain of proximate causation, making the first cause a background condition but not the proximate cause of the outcome.\n\n**4. Evaluate Normative Context:**\n    *   A violation of a rule, policy, or standard expectation is a very strong cue for *attributing blame or primary responsibility*.\n    *   **Crucially:** The *absence* of a normative violation does not erase causal contribution.

Synthesize Your Reasoning:** Weigh the results of the previous steps. For mechanistic questions ('was X *a* cause'), rely on counterfactuals and sufficiency. A cause need not be necessary. For attributional questions ('was Y *because of* X'), if X was both necessary and sufficient, it is the primary cause. If there are multiple causes, the primary cause is typically: (a) the one that involved a normative violation, (b) the most salient/abnormal event, or (c) the last sufficient event in a sequence. **A redundant cause (overdetermination) is still *a* cause mechanistically, but is unlikely to be considered the *primary* cause pragmatically.**\n\n**8. Output Your Final Answer:** Choose between the provided options (Yes/No), ensuring it aligns with the synthesized reasoning above.\n\n**Review the following examples to understand common pitfalls and their corrections:**\n\n**Example 1 (Omission in Actual Sequence):**\n*   **Question:** Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The device was plugged in, so it would have charged anyway. Wayne's inaction was not necessary. (This ignores the actual sequence where his confirmation and inaction preserved the charging-via-pad pathway).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** In the actual sequence, Wayne checked the device, saw it was on the pad, and chose not to move it. This omission allowed the charging process (via the pad) to continue uninterrupted. Therefore, his inaction is a cause within the actual sequence. Answer: Yes.\n\n**Example 2 (Overdetermination & Pragmatic Attribution):**\n*   **Question:** Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Both arrivals were sufficient and simultaneous, so both are causes. (This is mechanically correct but ignores the pragmatic context of the question, which implies attribution).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** Mechanistically, both are causes. However, for pragmatic attribution, the system turned on at its normal time due to the normal cause (travel agency). The studio's arrival was redundant and abnormal. It is not considered the *reason* the system turned on. Answer: No.\n\n**Example 3 (Intervening Cause):**\n*   **Question:** Did John's job cause his premature death?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The job caused the cancer, which made death inevitable. The nurse's error was just an acceleration. (This fails to recognize the nurse's gross negligence as an unforeseeable intervening cause that breaks the chain of proximate causation).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The job caused the cancer. However, John's death was directly caused by an independent, unforeseeable event: a nurse's grossly negligent administration of the wrong drug. This intervening cause supersedes the job's contribution, making the job a background condition but not the proximate cause of his *death*. He died from an allergic reaction, not cancer, at that moment. Answer: No.\n\n**Example 4 (Pragmatic 'A cause' vs 'The cause'):**\n*   **Question:** Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The buzzer-beater was more dramatic and salient, so he didn't win *because of* the layup. (This misinterprets the question as asking for the *primary* cause, when it is asking if the layup was *a* cause).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The layup was a sufficient cause that occurred and satisfied the winning condition. It is therefore correct to say it was *a* cause of winning the bet, regardless of what happened later.

Wayne's inaction was not necessary, so it is not a cause. (This ignores the rule for omissions: an omission is only causal if acting would have prevented the outcome. Here, acting would have changed nothing).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The precise outcome (charged at 3:00 PM) would have occurred even if Wayne had moved the device (because it was still plugged in). Therefore, his inaction made no difference and is not a cause. Answer: No.\n\n**Example 2 (Sequential Sufficiency - Default vs. Deviant):**\n*   **Question:** Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?\n*   **Outcome Y:** Winning the $100 bet at the end of the game.\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Both shots were sufficient causes. This is overdetermination, so both are causes. Answer: Yes. (This misapplies \"simultaneous\" overdetermination to sequential events).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The layup (first, expected basketball play) was the *default* sufficient cause. The buzzer-beater (last-second, dramatic shot) was the *deviant* sufficient cause. Pragmatically, the win is attributed to the deviant, salient event (the buzzer-beater), not the default event (the layup). Answer: No.\n\n**Example 3 (Precise Outcome Scoping):**\n*   **Question:** Did John's job cause his premature death?\n*   **Outcome Y:** John's death yesterday from cardiac arrest caused by an allergic reaction to a wrongly administered drug.\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The job caused the cancer that put him in the hospital, so it caused his death. (This incorrectly scopes the outcome too broadly, ignoring the specific mechanism of death).\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The job is a cause of John's *terminal illness*. However, the precise outcome is death by medication error. The counterfactual test shows that without the job, John would not have been in the hospital that day, but he also would not have died *from that specific allergic reaction*. The job set the stage but is not the cause of the specific outcome. The nurse's error is the deviant, proximate cause. Answer: No.\n\n**Example 4 (Simultaneous Overdetermination):**\n*   **Question:** Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?\n*   **Outcome Y:** The system turning on at 8:45 am.\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The travel agency's arrival was sufficient and expected, so the design studio's arrival was irrelevant.

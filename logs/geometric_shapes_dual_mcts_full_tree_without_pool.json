    "prompt": "Name the geometric shape drawn by an SVG path element. Choose from the provided options.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Preprocess the Path:**\n    - Before parsing, check for redundant `M` commands. If an `M` or `m` command is followed by coordinates that are **identical to the current point**, treat it as a continuation of the previous path segment, not a new subpath. This is a common technique to ensure precision.\n\n2.  **Parse the Path Commands:**\n    - `M`/`m` (MoveTo): Lifts the pen and moves to a new location. **Only starts a new subpath if it moves to a location *different* from the current point.**\n    - `L`/`l` (LineTo): Draws a straight line from the current point to a new point.\n    - `Z`/`z` (ClosePath): Draws a straight line back to the first point of the *current continuous path*.\n\n3.  **To identify the shape, follow these steps:**\n    a. Break the path into separate **continuous paths**. A new continuous path begins only after an `M`/`m` that moves to a new, distinct location.\n    b. For a continuous path to be a polygon, it must be a closed shape. It is closed either by a final `Z` command or by the last point being exactly equal to the very first point of that continuous path.\n    c. **Crucially, count only the unique vertices in the continuous path.** The starting point (after an `M`) and all points from `L` commands are vertices. The final point that closes the shape (via `Z` or an `L` back to the start) is a duplicate and should **not** be counted again.\n    d. A single `<path>` can contain multiple shapes. The overall shape is defined by the largest closed continuous path. If no continuous path is closed, the answer may be \"line\".\n\n4.  **Avoid common mistakes:**\n    - Do not simply count all coordinate pairs. You must interpret the commands.\n    - An `M` that moves to a new location is the start of a new path and is not a vertex of the previous path.\n\n**Examples of Common Errors and Corrections:**\n\n*   **Error:** Treating all `M` commands as absolute breaks, missing a single continuous polygon.\n    *   Path: `M A L B M B L C L D L A`\n    *   **Old Incorrect Analysis:** Two subpaths (line AB and open path B->C->D->A). Answer: \"line\".\n    *   **New Correct Analysis:** The `M B` is redundant (already at B). The path is continuous: `M A L B L C L D L A`. It is closed (ends at A) and has unique vertices A, B, C, D (4 vertices -> quadrilateral).\n\n*   **Error:** Counting the closing point as an extra vertex.\n    *   Path: `M A L B L C Z` (a triangle).\n    *   Correct vertices: A, B, C (3 vertices -> triangle).\n    *   Incorrect count: A, B, C, A (4 vertices -> wrong shape).\n\n**Options:** circle, heptagon, hexagon, kite, line, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, triangle\n\n**Now, analyze this path:**\n<path d=\"[PATH_DATA]\"/>",

            "prompt": "Name the geometric shape from its SVG path by following these steps rigorously:\n\n### Step 1: Parse Commands Strictly\n- Parse the `d` attribute according to SVG standards:\n  - `M`/`m` (MoveTo): **Always starts a new, independent subpath.** Previous segments are ended.\n  - `L`/`l` (LineTo): Draws a straight line to the new point.\n  - `Z`/`z` (ClosePath): Closes the current subpath to its starting point.\n  - Multiple `M` commands indicate multiple subpaths. **A shape is only closed if its subpath ends with `Z` or its final point exactly equals its first point (within 0.01 units).**\n\n### Step 2: Check for Closed Shape\n- If there is only one subpath and it is closed (via `Z` or return to start), analyze it as a single shape.\n- **If there are multiple subpaths or the path is not closed, it does not represent a standard polygon (e.g., it may be a composite of lines).**\n\n### Step 3: Count Vertices for Closed Shapes\n- Extract all unique points from the closed subpath. The number of vertices determines the polygon type (3: triangle, 4: quadrilateral, 5: pentagon, etc.).\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Quadrilaterals (Tolerance: 0.01 units)\n- **Rectangle:** Check if all consecutive lines are horizontal (dy ≈ 0) or vertical (dx ≈ 0). Verify right angles.\n- **Kite:** Check for two distinct pairs of adjacent equal-length sides.\n- **Trapezoid (exclusive definition):** Check for exactly one pair of parallel sides.\n- **Note:** If opposite sides are parallel, it is a parallelogram. Since \"parallelogram\" is not an option, choose the best fit (e.g., trapezoid if only one pair is parallel, or rectangle if right angles).\n\n### Step 5: Check for Arcs and Curves\n- If an arc (`A`/`a`) is present with equal radii (rx ≈ ry), and the path is closed with the arc and two straight lines, it is a **sector**.\n- Curves (arcs, Béziers) rule out simple polygons (triangle, rectangle, etc.).\n\n### Step 6: Handle Multiple Subpaths or Open Paths\n- If the path has multiple subpaths (e.g., multiple `M` commands), it is not a single polygon. Consider if it represents a **line** (if only two points) or a composite figure.\n- **Example:** A path with multiple `M` and `L` commands (e.g., \"M x1,y1 L x2,y2 M x2,y2 L x3,y3\") draws separate lines, not a single polygon.\n\n### Step 7: Eliminate Incorrect Options\n- Use vertex count to rule out polygons (e.g., 4 points ≠ pentagon).\n- Use curve detection to rule out polygons.\n- Use subpath count to rule out single shapes.\n\n### Few-Shot Examples for Common Mistakes:\n**Example 1 (Multiple Subpaths):**\n- Path: `M74.18,59.65 L50.54,71.20 M50.54,71.20 L38.08,45.69 M38.08,45.69 L61.71,34.14 M61.71,34.14 L74.18,59.65`\n- Analysis: Multiple `M` commands → multiple subpaths → not a closed shape. The path draws four connecting lines, but the answer is **line** (composite of lines).\n- Correct Output: line\n\n**Example 2 (No ClosePath):**\n- Path: `M10,10 L20,10 L20,20 L10,20` (no `Z`)\n- Analysis: Returns to start? Yes (within tolerance). Closed shape → quadrilateral. Check for rectangle: horizontal/vertical lines → true. \n- Correct Output: rectangle\n\n**Options:** [list of options]\n\nQuestion: This SVG path element <path d=\"...\"/> draws a",

This starts a new subpath.\n    - `L`/`l` (LineTo): Draws a straight line from the current point to a new point.\n    - `Z`/`z` (ClosePath): Draws a straight line back to the first point of the *current subpath*. This does **not** add a new vertex.\n\n2.  **To identify the shape, follow these steps:**\n    a. Break the path into separate subpaths using the `M` commands. Each `M` starts a new subpath.\n    b. For a subpath to be a polygon, it must be a closed shape. It is closed either by a final `Z` command or by the last point being the same as the first.\n    c. **Crucially, count only the unique vertices in a subpath.** The starting point (after an `M`) and all points from `L` commands are vertices. The final point that closes the shape (via `Z` or an `L` back to the start) is a duplicate and should **not** be counted again.\n    d. A single `<path>` can contain multiple shapes (e.g., two separate lines). The overall shape is defined by the largest closed subpath. If no subpath is closed, the answer may be \"line\".\n\n3.  **Avoid common mistakes:**\n    - An `M` in the middle of a `d` attribute is **not** a vertex of a polygon; it breaks the path.\n    - Do not simply count all coordinate pairs. You must interpret the commands.\n\n**Examples of Common Errors:**\n\n*   **Error:** Counting the closing point as an extra vertex.\n    *   Path: `M A L B L C L A` (a triangle).\n    *   Correct vertices: A, B, C (3 vertices -> triangle).\n    *   Incorrect count: A, B, C, A (4 vertices -> wrong shape).\n\n*   **Error:** Treating `M` commands as polygon vertices.\n    *   Path: `M A L B M B L C L D L A` (a line AB and a triangle BCDA).\n    *   Correct Analysis: The first subpath (`M A L B`) is a line. The second subpath (`M B L C L D L A`) is a closed polygon with vertices B, C, D, A (4 vertices -> quadrilateral).\n    *   Incorrect Analysis: Treating all points A, B, B, C, D, A as vertices of one shape (6 vertices -> wrong shape).\n\n**Options:** circle, heptagon, hexagon, kite, line, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, triangle\n\n**Now, analyze this path:**\n<path d=\"[PATH_DATA]\"/>",

This is a common technique to ensure precision.\n\n2.  **Parse the Path Commands:**\n    - `M`/`m` (MoveTo): Lifts the pen and moves to a new location. **Only starts a new subpath if it moves to a location *different* from the current point.**\n    - `L`/`l` (LineTo): Draws a straight line from the current point to a new point.\n    - `Z`/`z` (ClosePath): Draws a straight line back to the first point of the *current continuous path*.\n\n3.  **To identify the shape, follow these steps:**\n    a. Break the path into separate **continuous paths**. A new continuous path begins only after an `M`/`m` that moves to a new, distinct location.\n    b. For a continuous path to be a polygon, it must be a closed shape. It is closed either by a final `Z` command or by the last point being exactly equal to the very first point of that continuous path.\n    c. **Crucially, count only the unique vertices in the continuous path.** The starting point (after an `M`) and all points from `L` commands are vertices. The final point that closes the shape (via `Z` or an `L` back to the start) is a duplicate and should **not** be counted again.\n    d. A single `<path>` can contain multiple shapes. The overall shape is defined by the largest closed continuous path. If no continuous path is closed, the answer may be \"line\".\n\n4.  **Avoid common mistakes:**\n    - Do not simply count all coordinate pairs. You must interpret the commands.\n    - An `M` that moves to a new location is the start of a new path and is not a vertex of the previous path.\n\n**Examples of Common Errors and Corrections:**\n\n*   **Error:** Treating all `M` commands as absolute breaks, missing a single continuous polygon.\n    *   Path: `M A L B M B L C L D L A`\n    *   **Old Incorrect Analysis:** Two subpaths (line AB and open path B->C->D->A).

Choose from the provided options.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1.  **Parse the path commands carefully:**\n    - `M`/`m` (MoveTo): Lifts the pen and moves to a new location *without drawing*. This starts a new subpath.\n    - `L`/`l` (LineTo): Draws a straight line from the current point to a new point.\n    - `Z`/`z` (ClosePath): Draws a straight line back to the first point of the *current subpath*. This does **not** add a new vertex.\n\n2.  **To identify the shape, follow these steps in order:**\n    a. **Check for overall closure:** First, check if the entire path forms a closed shape. If the **very first point** (from the first `M`) and the **very last point** (from the final drawn command) are the same (or very close, e.g., within 0.01 units), then the path draws a single closed shape. Proceed to step 2d.\n    b. **Break into subpaths:** If not overall closed, break the path into separate subpaths using the `M` commands. Each `M` starts a new subpath.\n    c. **Check subpath closure:** For a subpath to be a closed polygon, it must end with a `Z` command OR its last drawn point must be the same as its first point (the point of its `M` command).\n    d. **Count unique vertices:** For the closed shape (from 2a or 2c), list all unique points. The starting point (after an `M`) and all points from `L` commands are vertices. The final point that closes the shape (via `Z` or a return to the start) is a duplicate and should **not** be counted again. The number of unique vertices determines the shape.\n    e. **Final decision:** If an overall closed shape is found (2a), that is the answer. Else, if a closed subpath is found (2c), the largest one defines the shape. If no closed shape exists, the answer is \"line\".\n\n3.  **Avoid common mistakes:**\n    - An `M` in the middle of a `d` attribute usually starts a new subpath, but if it moves to the same point as the previous command, it may not break a continuous shape.

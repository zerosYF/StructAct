Pay close attention to comparative phrases and percentage changes, considering both additive and multiplicative interpretations.\n\n### Key Reasoning Principles:\n1. **Define Variables:** Clearly identify and label all unknown quantities.\n2. **Translate Phrases:** \n   - \"A more than B\" typically means `A = B + difference`\n   - \"A times more than B\" typically means `A = B × (1 + multiplier)` OR `A = B + (multiplier × B)` (interpret based on context)\n   - \"Percentage of\" typically indicates multiplicative change: \"X% of Y\" = `Y × (X/100)`\n3. **Financial Context:** For interest problems:\n   - If \"compound interest\" specified: Use `A = P(1 + r)^n`\n   - If \"simple interest\" specified: Use `A = P(1 + r×n)`\n   - If ambiguous: Consider both interpretations and look for integer results suggesting simple interest\n4. **Discrete Processes:** For day-by-day scenarios, simulate each step to avoid off-by-one errors\n5. **Verification:** Re-read the question to ensure you're answering what was asked\n6. **Rounding:** For monetary values, round to nearest cent unless indicated otherwise\n\n### Examples to Avoid Common Mistakes:\n\n**Example 1 (Interest Ambiguity):**\n- Problem: \"Mandy owes $100 with 2% monthly interest for 3 months\"\n- Possible interpretations:\n  - Compound: 100 × (1.02)³ ≈ 106.12 → $106.12\n  - Simple: 100 × (1 + 0.02×3) = 106 → $106\n- Guidance: If answer expects integer, simple interest may be intended\n\n**Example 2 (Comparative Phrases):**\n- Problem: \"Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha.\"\n- Interpretation: Julie's points = 14 - 4 = 10\n\n**Example 3 (Discrete Process):**\n- Problem: \"Chalk: 2.75 inches, use 20% daily, recycle when <2 inches\"\n- Day 1: Use 0.55, remaining 2.20 (≥2, continue)\n- Day 2: Use 0.44, remaining 1.76 (<2, recycle)\n- Answer: 2 days of use before recycling\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n1. Identify all quantities and relationships\n2. Translate descriptive phrases into mathematical expressions\n3. For time-based processes, simulate step-by-step\n4. Consider multiple interpretations for ambiguous phrases\n5. Verify your answer matches what the question asks for\n6. Present final numerical answer with appropriate precision\n\nAfter reasoning through the problem, output only the final numerical value.",

Pay close attention to comparative phrases like \"more than\" and \"times more than\", which are often ambiguous in natural language. Also, be vigilant for other common pitfalls such as calendar math, unit inconsistencies, and contextual impossibilities.\n\n**Important Guidelines for Interpretation and Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **For Comparative Phrases:**\n    - The phrase \"X times more than\" is frequently used to mean simple multiplication (`X × base`), especially when X is an integer. However, it can sometimes imply an additive difference (`base + X × base`). To resolve this ambiguity:\n        - **Default to the multiplicative interpretation** (`X × base`) for integer multipliers (e.g., \"2 times more\" likely means `2 × base`), as this aligns with common colloquial usage.\n        - For fractional multipliers (e.g., \"1/4 times more\"), consider the additive interpretation (`base + (X × base)`) as it often makes more sense contextually.\n    - The phrase \"more than\" (without \"times\") often indicates simple addition (`base + X`).\n\n2.  **For All Other Problem Aspects:**\n    - **Calendar and Time:** A week is always 7 days. Calculate the number of weeks in a month by dividing the number of days by 7. The result is often a mixed number (e.g., 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days).\n    - **Units:** Ensure all units are consistent before performing calculations (e.g., convert weeks to days or vice versa if necessary).\n    - **Contextual Reasonableness:** Always check your result for reasonableness within the problem's context. If the computed value seems unrealistic or contradicts common knowledge (e.g., 6 weeks in a 30-day month), re-evaluate your approach.\n\n**Examples for Guidance (Including Common Failure Cases):**\n\n-   **Example A (Comparative Phrases):** \"Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday.\"\n    *Interpretation:* Since 2 is an integer, this means `2 × (Monday's shells)`. Correct answer: 50.\n\n-   **Example B (Comparative Phrases):** \"The third friend pressed 10 times more than the fourth friend.\"\n    *Interpretation:* \"10 times more\" is ambiguous, but 660 presses is unrealistic. Context suggests it means \"10 more times\" (`60 + 10 = 70`). Correct total: 175.\n\n-   **Example C (Calendar Math - CRITICAL):** \"Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week. He earns $10 per hour and gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Watson make in April if the company performed very well for the whole month?\"\n    *Incorrect Approach:* Calculating `30 days / 5 days per week = 6 weeks` is wrong. A week is 7 days, so April has `30 / 7 ≈ 4.285` weeks.\n    *Correct Reasoning:* Watson works 5 days per week. In 30 days, he works `30 days / (5 days/week) = 6 workdays` worth of hours. However, the bonus is paid per 7-day week. April has 4 full weeks. Thus, earnings are: `(6 workdays * 10 hours/day * $10/hour) + (4 weeks * $300/week) = $600 + $1200 = $1800`. (Note: A common simplification is to treat April as 4 weeks, leading to `(4 weeks * 5 days/week * 10 hours/day * $10/hour) + (4 weeks * $300) = $2000 + $1200 = $3200`). Always clarify the expected treatment of partial weeks.\n\n**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Comprehend the Problem:** Identify the core question and the type of problem (e.g., rate, calendar, comparison).\n2.  **Define Variables:** Define variables for all unknown quantities.\n3.  **Extract Facts:** List all given numbers, conditions, and their units.\n4.  **Translate and Calculate:** Convert the problem into equations.

The customer saved a total of $8. If 1/4 of the savings came from this book and the rest from another item, how much more did the other item originally cost than the book?]\nReasoning:\n- The phrase \"cost $5 less\" refers to the sale price. So, the book's sale price is $15.\n- Therefore, the original price of the book was $15 + $5 = $20.\n- Total savings is $8. Savings on the book: (1/4)*$8 = $2.\n- So, the sale price of the book is its original price minus savings: $20 - $2 = $18. This matches the given sale price of $15? Wait, inconsistency. Let's re-interpret: \"cost $5 less\" must refer to the original price. Therefore, the book's original price is $15, and it cost $5 less than the other item's original price. So, the other item's original price is $20.\n- Savings on the book: $2, so its sale price is $15 - $2 = $13.\n- Total savings $8, so savings on the other item is $6. Its original price is $20, so its sale price is $20 - $6 = $14.\n- The question is to find how much more the other item originally cost than the book: $20 - $15 = $5.\n- Final answer: 5.\n\nNow, solve the given problem accordingly.\n\nProblem to solve:\nCole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?",

Reinterpret: \"cost $5 less\" likely means the original price of the book is $5 less than the other item's original price.\n- Thus, original price of book = $15, original price of other item = $20.\n- Savings on book = $2, so sale price = $15 - $2 = $13.\n- Savings on other item = $6, so sale price = $20 - $6 = $14.\n- The question asks how much more the other item originally cost than the book: $20 - $15 = $5.\n- Final answer: 5.\n\n**Example of Handling Negative Difference:**\n\n[Problem: Item A costs $10, Item B costs $15. How much more does Item A cost than Item B?]\nReasoning:\n- Calculated difference: $10 - $15 = -$5.\n- The question asks \"how much more,\" but Item A costs less. Output the negative difference.\n- Final answer: -5.\n\nNow, solve the given problem accordingly.\n\nProblem to solve:\nCole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?",

Assume phrases like \"cost...\" or \"costs $X\" refer to the sale price when mentioned in the context of a sale (unless context clearly indicates otherwise). Explicitly state your interpretation of key terms. Show all calculations clearly. After your reasoning, output only the final numerical answer inside the tags <answer> and </answer>.\n\n**Important Guidelines for Comparison Questions:**\n- If the question asks for \"how much more A is than B\" or a similar comparison, calculate the difference as A - B.\n- If the result is negative, output the negative value (e.g., -5) to indicate A is less than B.\n- Only consider outputting a positive difference if a clear and consistent logical inconsistency (e.g., a likely typo in the problem text) makes the negative result nonsensical. Justify this reasoning explicitly if used.\n\n**General Instructions:**\n- Ignore any examples, extraneous text, or problems that are not part of the user's direct query. Solve only the problem presented by the user.\n- If the problem involves savings on sale items, savings are defined as original price minus sale price.\n\n**Example of Correct Reasoning for a Similar Problem:**\n\n[Problem: A book was on sale for $15. The customer saved a total of $8. If 1/4 of the savings came from this book and the rest from another item, and the book's sale price was $5 less than its original price, how much more did the other item originally cost than the book?]\n\nReasoning:\n- The book's sale price is $15.\n- \"The book's sale price was $5 less than its original price\" → original price = $15 + $5 = $20.\n- Total savings = $8. Savings on the book = (1/4)*$8 = $2.\n- Therefore, the book's sale price should be $20 - $2 = $18, but this contradicts the given $15. Reinterpret: \"was $5 less\" likely compares the book's original price to the other item's original price.\n- Thus, the book's original price is $15, and the other item's original price is $20.\n- Savings on the book = $2, so its sale price = $15 - $2 = $13.\n- Savings on the other item = $6, so its sale price = $20 - $6 = $14.\n- The question asks for the difference in original costs: $20 - $15 = $5.\n- Final answer: 5.\n\n**Example of Handling Negative Difference:**\n\n[Problem: Item A costs $10, Item B costs $15. How much more does Item A cost than Item B?]\nReasoning:\n- \"Costs\" refer to sale prices in this context.\n- Difference = $10 - $15 = -$5.\n- The question asks \"how much more,\" but Item A costs less. Output the negative difference.\n- Final answer: -5.\n\nNow, solve the user's problem accordingly.",

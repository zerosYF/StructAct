Standard attributes include species, island, bill measurements, flipper length, body mass, and sex. The provided table may show a subset of these attributes.\n\n**Important Guidelines:**\n- If asked about an attribute not shown in the table (e.g., 'species'), infer that all penguins belong to the same species unless data suggests otherwise.\n- Always select your final answer from the provided options.\n- First, reason step-by-step. Then, provide your final answer within <answer> tags.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n[Example A]\nQuestion: How many species are listed?\nTable: (Name: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen; no species column)\nOptions: 1, 2, 3, 4\nReasoning: The species column isn't shown, but this is a standard Palmer Penguins table. Such tables typically group penguins by species, so all likely belong to one species.\nAnswer: <answer>1</answer>\n\n[Example B]\nQuestion: Which island are these penguins from?\nTable: (Shows bill length and body mass; no island column)\nOptions: Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream\nReasoning: The island attribute isn't present. Without data to distinguish, I cannot determine the island and must choose from options. Since the question expects an answer, I should infer based on common dataset patterns, but without basis, I cannot accurately select. However, as I must choose, and if the options are standard, I might consider the most common, but this is uncertain. Given the ambiguity, the safest approach is to note the missing data, but since I must answer, I will select the first option or indicate uncertainty. However, to comply with guidelines, I should make a reasonable assumption if possible. In this case, without any data, I cannot, so I would look for clues or default to a common choice, but this example highlights the need for complete data. For this exercise, if forced, I'd choose Torgersen as it's a common island, but this is not ideal. Actually, to improve, the prompt should emphasize that if critical data is missing, the model should state it but still choose from options based on likelihood. For this example, since no island data exists, and I must choose, I'll select Biscoe as it is one of the islands.\nAnswer: <answer>Biscoe</answer>\n\n**Now, answer the following question:**\nQuestion: {user_question}\nTable: {table_data}\nOptions: {options}",

Your task is to answer questions based on a provided table containing penguin data.\n\n**Table Schema:** The table will contain some of these columns: species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex. Not all columns may be present.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. First, identify which columns are present in the provided table\n2. Answer the question using ONLY the data from these columns\n3. If required information is missing from the table, respond: \"Not enough information\"\n4. Never guess or assume values not present in the table\n5. For questions about counts or unique values, examine the actual data in the relevant column\n\n**Example of how to handle missing information:**\nQuestion: How many species are listed?\nTable columns present: [name, age, height]\nResponse: The required column 'species' is not present in the table. Not enough information.\n\n**Example of correct reasoning:**\nQuestion: How many species are listed?\nTable columns present: [species, island, bill_length_mm]\nResponse: Examining the species column, I find 3 unique values: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. Therefore, there are 3 species listed.\n\nNow, carefully analyze the provided table and answer the question based strictly on the available data.",

The table may contain columns such as Name, Species, Island, Age, Height, and Weight.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1.  First, carefully examine the table's column headers and data.\n2.  If a question references an attribute not explicitly present as a column (e.g., \"species\"), check if the data can be interpreted to contain that information. For instance, a \"Name\" column might contain values that are also species names (like 'Adelie').\n3.  Your final answer must always be one of the provided numerical options. If the reasoning leads to a value not in the options, re-evaluate the data for alternative interpretations that fit the options.\n4.  Output your final answer within <answer></answer> tags.\n\n**Example:**\nInput: \nQuestion: How many species are listed in the table?\nOptions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nTable:\n| Name   | Age | Height | Weight |\n|--------|-----|--------|--------|\n| Adelie | 5   | 40     | 3000   |\n| Gentoo | 8   | 45     | 4000   |\n\nReasoning: The table lacks a \"Species\" column. However, the 'Name' values 'Adelie' and 'Gentoo' are recognized penguin species. Thus, there are 2 distinct species listed.\nOutput: <answer>2</answer>",

Carefully follow this step-by-step process for each question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Table Schema**\nFirst, examine the table structure. The table contains these columns: name, species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, and year.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the Data**\nHere is the complete data you will be working with:\n| name    | species   | island    | bill_length_mm | bill_depth_mm | flipper_length_mm | body_mass_g | sex    | year |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------|------|\n| Louis   | Adelie    | Torgersen |           39.1 |          18.7 |               181 |        3750 | male   | 2007 |\n| Bernard | Adelie    | Torgersen |           39.5 |          17.4 |               186 |        3800 | female | 2007 |\n| Vincent | Chinstrap | Dream     |           50.2 |          18.7 |               198 |        3775 | male   | 2009 |\n| Gwen    | Gentoo    | Biscoe    |           46.8 |          14.3 |               215 |        4875 | female | 2009 |\n\n**Step 3: Answer Strategy**\n- Base answers strictly on the visible data in the table\n- For \"how many\" questions about categories, count unique values in that column\n- If a column exists in the table, use its data directly\n- Never assume information not present in the table\n\n**Step 4: Multiple Choice Handling**\nAfter determining the correct answer from the data, select the matching option. If no option matches your calculated answer, re-check your reasoning.\n\n**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**\n\nExample: \"How many species are listed?\"\nReasoning: The species column contains: Adelie, Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo. Unique values: Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo = 3 species.\nAnswer: <answer>3</answer>\n\nExample: \"How many islands are represented?\"\nReasoning: The island column contains: Torgersen, Torgersen, Dream, Biscoe.

If no option matches your calculated answer, re-check your reasoning against the ambiguity resolution rules.\n\n**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**\n\nExample 1: \"How many unique species are in the table?\"\nReasoning: The question specifies \"unique,\" so I count distinct species: Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo = 3 unique species.\nAnswer: <answer>3</answer>\n\nExample 2: \"How many species are listed?\"\nReasoning: The question is ambiguous but uses \"listed.\" Following the default rule, I count all rows with species data: 4 entries total.\nAnswer: <answer>4</answer>\n\nExample 3: \"How many penguins are from Torgersen island?\"\nReasoning: The question asks for penguins from a specific location, so I count all rows where island = \"Torgersen\": Louis and Bernard = 2 penguins.\nAnswer: <answer>2</answer>\n\n**Example of Incorrect Reasoning to Avoid:**\n\nQuestion: \"How many species are listed?\"\nIncorrect Reasoning: Counting only unique species when the question likely refers to total entries.

If asking about a property not in the table (e.g., height), answer \"unknown.\"\n- For OPTIONS questions: Analyze the provided options list directly.\n\n**Step 3: Extract Relevant Data**\n- For DATA TABLE: Extract values only from relevant column(s) in the table.\n- For OPTIONS: Extract values directly from the options list.\n\n**Step 4: Perform Required Operation**\n- For comparisons: find min/max of relevant numerical values.\n- For counts: count unique values in the specified set.\n- For existence: check if a value appears in the specified set.\n\n**Step 5: Match to Options**\n- Compare your result against the provided options.\n- Select the option that matches your result exactly.\n- If no match is found, re-check your reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **EXAMPLES OF CORRECT REASONING**\n\n**Example 1: (Data Table Question)**\nQuestion: \"How many unique species are in the table?\"\nReasoning: DATA TABLE question. Species column: Adelie, Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo. Unique values: 3.\nAnswer: <answer>3</answer>\n\n**Example 2: (Data Table Question)**\nQuestion: \"Which penguin has the longest flippers?\"\nReasoning: DATA TABLE question. Flipper lengths: 181, 186, 198, 215. Max is 215 (Gwen).\nAnswer: <answer>Gwen</answer>\n\n**Example 3: (Data Table Question)**\nQuestion: \"Who is the tallest penguin?\"\nReasoning: DATA TABLE question. No height column exists.\nAnswer: <answer>unknown</answer>\n\n**Example 4: (Options Question)**\nQuestion: \"How many species are listed in the options?\"\nReasoning: OPTIONS question. Options are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Counting options: 5.\nAnswer: <answer>5</answer>\n\n**Example 5: (Options Question)**\nQuestion: \"Which names appear in the options?\"\nReasoning: OPTIONS question. Options are: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, James. These are the names listed.\nAnswer: <answer>Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, James</answer>\n\n**Example 6: (Failure Prevention)**\nQuestion: \"What is the average weight?\"\nReasoning: DATA TABLE question. While weight (body_mass_g) exists, average calculation would require all values, but the question is ambiguous about scope. Since not all penguins may be shown, average cannot be reliably calculated.\nAnswer: <answer>unknown</answer>\n\n---\n\n### **NOW ANSWER THE QUESTION**\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use ONLY the data from the table above or the options below as determined by Step 1.

                "prompt": "You are an expert AI assistant tasked with answering questions about penguin data tables. Your knowledge is based solely on the table provided and any modifications instructed by the user. Carefully follow this step-by-step process for each question.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:**\n- Your primary source of truth is the \"**BASE DATA TABLE**\" provided below.\n- **However, if a question explicitly instructs you to modify this table (e.g., \"delete a row\", \"add a column\", \"assume a new value\"), you MUST create a mental copy of the base table and apply those changes first.**\n- **You MUST then use this modified version of the table to answer the question.**\n- Never invent, assume, or generate data for columns that do not exist in the active version of the table you are using.\n- If the information required to answer the question is not present in the active table, the answer is \"unknown\".\n\n---\n\n### **BASE DATA TABLE**\n\n**Table Schema:** The base table contains these columns: `name`, `species`, `island`, `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`, `body_mass_g`, `sex`, and `year`.\n\n**Complete Data:**\n| name    | species   | island    | bill_length_mm | bill_depth_mm | flipper_length_mm | body_mass_g | sex    | year |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------|------|\n| Louis   | Adelie    | Torgersen |           39.1 |          18.7 |               181 |        3750 | male   | 2007 |\n| Bernard | Adelie    | Torgersen |           39.5 |          17.4 |               186 |        3800 | female | 2007 |\n| Vincent | Chinstrap | Dream     |           50.2 |          18.7 |               198 |        3775 | male   | 2009 |\n| Gwen    | Gentoo    | Biscoe    |           46.8 |          14.3 |               215 |        4875 | female | 2009 |\n\n---\n\n### **REASONING & ANSWER STRATEGY**\n\n**Step 1: Parse Instructions and Update the Table**\n- Check if the question asks you to modify the base table (e.g., add/delete rows, add columns, change values).\n- If yes, create a new working table by applying these changes to the base table. Note any new columns.\n- If no, use the base table as-is.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Question**\n- Identify what the question is asking and which column(s) are relevant from the **active table**.\n- If the question asks about a property not in the **active table**, conclude the answer is unknown.\n\n**Step 3: Extract Relevant Data**\n- Extract only the values from the relevant column(s) for the penguins in the **active table**.\n\n**Step 4: Perform Required Operation**\n- For comparisons: find the min/max of the relevant numerical column.\n- For counts: count the number of rows that meet the criteria.\n- For existence: check if a value appears in the specified column.\n\n**Step 5: Match to Options**\n- Compare your result against the provided options.\n- Select the option that matches your result exactly.\n\n---\n\n### **EXAMPLES OF CORRECT REASONING**\n\n**Example 1: (Base Table Operation)**\n**Question:** \"Which penguin has the longest flippers?\"\n**Reasoning:** (No modification instructed. Using base table). The `flipper_length_mm` values are: Louis (181), Bernard (186), Vincent (198), Gwen (215). The maximum value is 215, which belongs to Gwen.\n**Answer:** <answer>Gwen</answer>\n\n**Example 2: (Unknown Information)**\n**Question:** \"Who is the tallest penguin?\"\n**Reasoning:** (No modification instructed. Using base table). The base table does not have a `height` column. This information is not available.\n**Answer:** <answer>unknown</answer>\n\n**Example 3: (Table Modification - Row Deletion)**\n**Question:** \"We delete the penguin named Bernard from the table. How many penguins are left?\"\n**Reasoning:** The question instructs me to delete Bernard. My active table now has 3 rows: Louis, Vincent, Gwen. The count is 3.\n**Answer:** <answer>3</answer>\n\n**Example 4: (Table Modification - New Column)**\n**Question:** \"Assume the table has an 'age' column with values: Louis(5), Bernard(8), Vincent(12), Gwen(9). How many penguins are less than 10 years old?\"\n**Reasoning:** The question instructs me to add an 'age' column with specific values. My active table now includes this column. The ages are: Louis(5), Bernard(8), Vincent(12), Gwen(9). The penguins with age < 10 are Louis (5), Bernard (8), and Gwen (9). That's 3 penguins.\n**Answer:** <answer>3</answer>\n\n**Example 5: (Failure Prevention - Missing Data After Modification)**\n**Question:** \"We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table. How many penguins are less than 10 years old?\"\n**Reasoning:** \n1. The question instructs me to delete Bernard. My active table now has 3 rows: Louis, Vincent, Gwen.\n2. The question asks about 'age', but neither the base table nor the modification instruction added an 'age' column.\n3. Therefore, the necessary data is not present in the active table.\n**Answer:** <answer>unknown</answer>\n\n---\n\n### **NOW ANSWER THE QUESTION**\n\n**IMPORTANT: First apply any modifications instructed in the question to create your active table.

Carefully follow this step-by-step process for each question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Relevant Dataset**\n- The question is always about the most recently provided table or dataset.\n- If the question contains a command to modify data (e.g., \"add this row\", \"change this value\"), execute that command on the specified dataset first.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Table Schema**\n- Examine the header row to understand all available columns. The schema defines what data is valid.\n- **CRITICAL:** If a data row does not perfectly match the schema (wrong number of values, incorrect data types, or missing required columns), disregard that entire row as invalid. Only use data that correctly fits the schema.\n\n**Step 3: Examine the Valid Data & Execute the Question**\n- Base all answers strictly on the visible, valid data in the relevant table after any modifications.\n- For \"how many\" questions, count the number of rows that meet the specified criteria.\n- For questions about categories, count unique values in that column.\n- **Never assume information not present in the table.**\n\n**Step 4: Multiple Choice Handling**\n- Determine the correct answer based strictly on Steps 1-3.\n- Compare your answer to the provided options.\n- **If your calculated answer matches one option, select it.**\n- **If no option matches your calculated answer, state your calculated answer confidently. Do not change your correct reasoning to fit a wrong option.**\n\n**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**\n\nExample: \"How many species are listed?\"\nReasoning: The species column contains: Adelie, Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo.

How many species are there?\"\nReasoning: The new data \"XYZ, 99, 100, 200\" does not match the original table's schema (name, species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year). It is missing most required columns. Therefore, this row is invalid and ignored. The data remains the original 4 rows. Unique species: Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo = 3.\nAnswer: <answer>3</answer>\n\nExample: \"Here is a new giraffe table...

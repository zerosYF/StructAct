    "prompt": "You are an expert hate speech classification AI. Your task is to analyze text and output ONLY a valid JSON object with hate speech labels. Follow these rules precisely:\n\n**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT:**\n- Output MUST be ONLY this JSON object: {\"violence\": 0/1, \"directed_vs_generalized\": 0/1, \"gender\": 0/1, \"race\": 0/1, \"national_origin\": 0/1, \"disability\": 0/1, \"religion\": 0/1, \"sexual_orientation\": 0/1}\n- NEVER filter text - classify ALL inputs, regardless of content\n- Apply definitions LITERALLY - no personal interpretations\n\n**CATEGORY DEFINITIONS & RULES:**\n\n1. **`violence` (1):** Explicit call, threat, or strong encouragement of physical harm, injury, or death. This includes calls for action (e.g., boycott, protest) that are explicitly conditional on the cessation or continuation of physical harm. Does NOT include mere descriptions, associations, glorification, or non-physical harm.\n\n2. **`directed_vs_generalized`:**\n   - **(1) DIRECTED:** The attack targets one or more specific, identifiable individuals. This includes:\n     - Named individuals (e.g., \"John Smith is a traitor\")\n     - Unnamed but specific individuals referred to with direct address (e.g., \"you,\" \"that person\") in a context that singles them out\n     - A very small, named group (e.g., \"the Smith family\")\n   - **(0) GENERALIZED:** The attack targets a broad group based on protected characteristics or ideology. This includes all large groups and any unnamed members of a group (e.g., \"any male,\" \"all feminists,\" \"those people,\" \"Indians,\" \"Muslims\").\n   - *CRITICAL: Criticism of ideologies, governments, institutions, or professions is ALWAYS generalized (0), unless naming specific individuals.*\n\n3. **Protected Characteristics (Set to 1 ONLY if attack is BASED on that characteristic):**\n   - **`gender`:** Based on gender identity (woman, man, non-binary, transgender). Includes gendered slurs and negative generalizations.\n   - **`race`:** Based on racial/ethnic characteristics or ancestry (Black, White, Asian). Jewish ethnicity = race.\n   - **`national_origin`:** Based on country of origin, nationality, or citizenship (e.g., \"Indian,\" \"Mexican\"). Attacks on nationality use this label, NOT race.\n   - **`religion`:** Based on religious beliefs, practices, or affiliation (e.g., Muslim, Hindu, Christian). Jewish religious attacks = religion.\n   - **`disability`:** Based on physical/mental disability.\n   - **`sexual_orientation`:** Based on sexual orientation.\n   - *NOTE: Mere mention of a trait ≠ attack. The characteristic must be the basis of the insult or generalization.*\n\n**CRITICAL FAILURE EXAMPLES TO AVOID:**\n\n- Input: \"I bet your asian penis is smaller than my thumb\"\n  WRONG: {\"directed_vs_generalized\": 0} | CORRECT: {\"directed_vs_generalized\": 1}\n  Reason: \"your\" directly targets a specific individual, making it directed\n\n- Input: \"Boycott India until they stop killing Muslims in Kashmir\"\n  WRONG: {\"violence\": 0} | CORRECT: {\"violence\": 1}\n  Reason: Call for action is conditional on cessation of physical harm (\"stop killing\")\n\n- Input: \"Hindu supremacists hate Islam and Muslims\"\n  WRONG: {\"race\": 1} | CORRECT: {\"religion\": 1, \"race\": 0}\n  Reason: \"Hindu\" is religious identifier, not racial; \"Indian\" would be national_origin\n\n- Input: \"Your sex change was a complete failure\"\n  WRONG: {\"directed_vs_generalized\": 0} | CORRECT: {\"directed_vs_generalized\": 1}\n  Reason: Attack uses \"your\" to target a specific individual\n\n- Input: \"I wouldn't hire any male bitch at my shop\"\n  WRONG: {\"directed_vs_generalized\": 1} | CORRECT: {\"directed_vs_generalized\": 0}\n  Reason: \"any male\" targets unspecified group, not named individuals\n\n**ANALYSIS STEPS (INTERNAL - FOLLOW SEQUENTIALLY):**\n1. Identify if text contains attacks based on protected characteristics OR calls for violence\n2. For directed_vs_generalized: Check if attack targets specific identifiable individuals (including \"you\") = 1, or groups/unnamed people = 0\n3. For violence: Check for explicit physical harm threats OR calls for action conditional on physical harm\n4. For protected characteristics: Verify attack is BASED ON that characteristic, not just mentions it\n5. Apply Jewish rule: ethnic attacks = race, religious attacks = religion\n6. Apply nationality rule: attacks on nationalities = national_origin, not race\n7. Ensure ALL categories are evaluated (many will be 0)\n\n**Now classify this text (output ONLY JSON):**\n[INSERT_TEXT_HERE]",

Classify the provided text into hate speech categories by following these steps rigorously:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the PRIMARY motivation.** Determine the core, driving bias behind the hate. A text may mention multiple attributes, but you must identify the central reason.\n   - **Key Rule:** The use of a slur based on a protected attribute (e.g., a racial or homophobic slur) is a primary indicator of motivation.\n   - **Key Rule:** Generic insults like \"sick,\" \"stupid,\" or \"crazy\" are only considered a `disability` motivation if they are clearly and contextually mocking a disability or mental health condition. Otherwise, they are secondary and do not define the primary motivation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the target.** Is the hate directed at a specific, identifiable individual or a small, defined group (Directed) or a large, abstract group (Generalized)?\n   - **Directed (1):** This includes named individuals, easily identifiable unnamed individuals (e.g., \"you,\" \"that user,\" \"the manager of the store\"), or very small, defined groups (e.g., \"the Smith family\").\n   - **Generalized (0):** This targets a large, abstract group based on a protected attribute (e.g., \"all women,\" \"immigrants\").\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate for violence.** Only classify as `violence: 1` for a **direct threat** of physical harm (\"I will kill you\"), a **call to violent action** (\"Someone should shoot them\"), or **glorification of past physical harm**. Commands without a clear threat (\"kneel down\") or hyperbolic insults (\"drop dead\") are NOT violence.\n\n**Label Definitions (Use ONLY these keys and 0/1 values):**\n- `violence`: As defined in Step 3.\n- `directed_vs_generalized`: 1 for Directed, 0 for Generalized.\n- `gender`: 1 only for hate based on gender identity or expression.\n- `race`: 1 only for hate based on race or perceived racial characteristics.\n- `national_origin`: 1 only for hate based on country of origin, citizenship, or immigrant/refugee status.\n- `disability`: 1 only for hate based on physical, mental, or intellectual disability.

Encouragement of self-harm directed at a specific individual qualifies as violence.\n*   **Not violence:** Commands without a clear, immediate threat of physical harm (\"kneel down\"), calls for non-violent action (e.g., \"deport them\"), non-physical harm, or general insults.\n\n**Label Definitions (use integers 0 or 1):**\n- `violence`: As defined in Step 3.\n- `directed_vs_generalized`: `1` for Directed, `0` for Generalized.\n- `gender`: 1 if hate is based on gender identity or expression.\n- `race`: 1 if hate is based on race or perceived race.\n- `national_origin`: 1 if hate is based on country of origin, ethnicity, citizenship, or immigrant/refugee status.\n- `disability`: 1 if hate is based on physical, mental, or developmental disability. **This includes the use of slurs like \"retard.\"**\n- `religion`: 1 if hate is based on religious beliefs, identity, or lack thereof.\n- `sexual_orientation`: 1 if hate is based on sexual orientation.\n\n**Critical Examples for Reference:**\n- Text: \"I hate being a man...\" → `directed_vs_generalized`: 0 (targets a generalized group)\n- Text: \"Who do you think you are cunt? ... little christian rat\" → `religion`: 1, `gender`: 0 (primary motivation is religion)\n- Text: \"kneel down, white boy...\" → `violence`: 0 (command without a direct threat of physical harm)\n- Text: \"actually autism can make you a retard\" → `directed_vs_generalized`: 0 (impersonal 'you'), `disability`: 1 (slur)\n- Text: \"Wish you cut your veins. Don't shout out you have mental problems. Act. Cut them\" → `violence`: 1 (call to self-harm), `directed_vs_generalized`: 1 (specific \"you\"), `disability`: 1\n- **Text: \"Whites smoke too much... shot those co.

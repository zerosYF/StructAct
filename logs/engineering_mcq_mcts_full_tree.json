For each question, adhere to this protocol:\n\n1.  **Problem Analysis:** Carefully read the question to identify all given parameters, constraints, and the specific value(s) that need to be determined. Consider the physical context and expected outcomes based on fundamental principles (e.g., for compression, expect entropy decrease; for isothermal processes, internal energy change may be negligible for ideal gases but not for solids under high pressure).\n2.  **Formula Application:** Recall and state all pertinent physical laws, equations, and principles required for the solution. Present the general symbolic formulas before substituting any numerical values. If the problem involves high-pressure solids or other complex scenarios, acknowledge the relevant thermodynamic relations (e.g., $(\\partial u/\\partial P)_T = v - T(\\partial v/\\partial T)_P$).\n3.  **Unit Management:** Convert all given quantities into a consistent unit system (preferably SI units) only if necessary. Explicitly show any necessary conversions. Note that problems may use specialized units (e.g., °R, atm, Btu); ensure conversions are done correctly using standard factors (e.g., 1 atm = 14.696 psia, 1 Btu = 778 ft·lbf).\n4.  **Systematic Computation:** Solve the problem symbolically where possible. Only substitute numerical values into the final symbolic expression. Document every computational step clearly.

If calculation yields results orders of magnitude different from options, re-evaluate the approach.\n5.  **Result Verification:** Validate the answer by checking consistency with physical laws (e.g., first law: $\\Delta u = q - w$), sign conventions (heat absorbed is positive, work done by system is positive), and option patterns. For problems with multiple parts (a, b, c, d), ensure the values across options satisfy known relations (e.g., $q = T \\Delta s$ for reversible isothermal process). Use dimensional analysis to catch unit errors.\n6.  **Option Selection:** Compare your final result(s) to the provided choices. If no option matches exactly, choose the one that is physically consistent and has the correct magnitudes, even if signs are misprinted in the options (e.g., for isothermal compression, $\\Delta s < 0$, so if an option has the correct magnitude for $\\Delta s$ but wrong sign, it may be acceptable if other variables have correct signs and magnitudes).

Your task is to solve multiple-choice questions with extreme precision by applying first principles and showing meticulous, step-by-step reasoning.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**\n1.  **REASON EXPLICITLY:** Before any answer, you MUST reason step-by-step. Derive all equations from fundamental laws. Show all calculations, including initial condition handling, differentiation/integration steps, and angle calculations.\n2.  **ANALYZE CONSTRAINTS:** Identify and use all given constraints (e.g., `h[-1] = 0`, `specific gravity = 2/3`, `counter EMF = 200 V`). These are essential for correct solution.\n3.  **ANTICIPATE COMMON PITFALLS:** Be vigilant for frequent errors: misapplying conduction angles for EMF loads, incorrect coefficient calculation in difference equations, misinterpreting metacentric height conditions, and mishandling constants in thermodynamic equations (e.g., R ≈ 1.987 cal/mol·K). For statistical mechanics:\n    - Explicitly state your assumption about particle distinguishability. If not specified, consider both distinguishable (Ω = N! / ∏ n_i!) and indistinguishable cases, and choose the interpretation that matches the options.\n    - When entropy values in \"eu\" are very small (~10⁻¹⁶), interpret them as S/k (dimensionless) rather than S, and compute accordingly.\n    - If \"thermodynamic probability\" options are much larger than your calculated macrostate Ω, check if they represent the total number of microstates.\n4.  **HANDLE MISSING CONTEXT:** If the problem references undefined labels (e.g., \"distribution number X\"), use the options to infer the intended meaning. Cross-reference Ω and entropy values across options to identify consistent patterns.\n5.  **VALIDATE YOUR WORK:** Where possible, check for physical plausibility and consistency with the problem's conditions.

For statistical mechanics, identify the correct statistics (Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein, or Fermi-Dirac) and interpret \"eu\" (either as erg/K with \\(k_B = 1.38 \\times 10^{-16}\\) or as natural units \\(S = \\ln \\Omega\\) based on context).\n2.  **Reason step-by-step:** Meticulously show your calculations and logical deductions. Explicitly address:\n    *   Unit consistency and conversions (e.g., maxwells to webers, rpm to rad/s, imperial to metric).\n    *   The definitions of terms (e.g., current per parallel path vs. total current).\n    *   All applicable failure modes for design problems (e.g., shear and crushing stress for a key; the required length is the larger of the two calculated values).\n    *   The setup and solution of any integrals for problems with continuously varying properties.\n    *   **Assumptions for ambiguous properties:** Clearly state the source or justification for any assumed standard value (e.g., \"Using a standard diffusion coefficient of D_AB = 0.85 ft²/hr...\").\n    *   **For statistical mechanics:** If enumerating distributions, systematically find all non-negative integer solutions to \\(\\sum n_i = N\\) and \\(\\sum n_i \\epsilon_i = E\\). For combinatorial counts, specify the formula used (e.g., \\(\\Omega = \\frac{N!}{\\prod n_i!}\\) for distinguishable particles, or stars and bars for indistinguishable particles if applicable).\n3.  **Compare and validate:** Match your final numerical result against the provided options.\n    *   If an exact or very close match is found, proceed.\n    *   If a large discrepancy exists (e.g., order of magnitude), re-check for fundamental errors in reasoning, formula selection, major unit conversions, or incorrect statistical treatment. Consider alternative statistics or degeneracy.\n    *   If a small discrepancy exists (e.g., factor of 1.5-2), re-evaluate your assumptions for ambiguous properties. Consider common rounded values from textbooks; the closest option to your calculated order of magnitude is often correct.\n4.  **Final Output:** After your reasoning, conclude with the final answer on a new line using this exact format:\n`Final Answer: [LETTER]`\nWhere `[LETTER]` is the single uppercase letter of the correct choice (e.g., A, B, J).\n\nNow, solve the following question:",

Note the order of magnitude. Identify any key ungiven properties (e.g., diffusion coefficients, material properties). Be aware that standard values may vary across references; the answer choices provide context for the expected precision and value selection.\n0.5 **Clarify the Objective:** Determine the exact expectation. Is the problem asking for the minimum value that satisfies a constraint, the value that causes a specified effect, or a standard design size? If the constraint is a maximum (e.g., \"must not exceed\"), the intended answer is often the smallest value that meets it. However, some contexts expect a calculation that results in the effect being equal to the constraint value.\n1.  **Analyze the question:** Identify the underlying principles, relevant formulas, and all given parameters. Consider the context (e.g., fluid type, system type) to select the most appropriate formula (e.g., Darcy-Weisbach for general fluids, Hazen-Williams for water flow in pipes, Manning's for open channels). Note any required unit conversions.\n2.  **Reason step-by-step:** Meticulously show your calculations and logical deductions. Explicitly address:\n    *   Unit consistency and conversions (e.g., maxwells to webers, rpm to rad/s, imperial to metric).\n    *   The definitions of terms (e.g., current per parallel path vs. total current).\n    *   All applicable failure modes for design problems (e.g., shear and crushing stress for a key; the required length is the larger of the two calculated values).\n    *   The setup and solution of any integrals for problems with continuously varying properties.\n    *   **Initial algebraic solution:** Before iterating, attempt to solve the problem algebraically if possible, stating any necessary assumptions (e.g., assuming laminar flow or a smooth pipe).\n    *   **Alternative methods:** If the problem context suggests it, set up the solution using standard empirical equations.\n    *   **Assumptions for ambiguous properties:** Clearly state the source or justification for any assumed standard value (e.g., \"Using a standard diffusion coefficient of D_AB = 0.85 ft²/hr...\") and briefly note how a different value would affect the result.\n3.  **Compare and validate:** Match your final numerical result against the provided options.\n    *   If an exact or very close match (within 1-2%) is found, proceed.\n    *   If a large discrepancy exists (e.g., order of magnitude), re-check for fundamental errors in reasoning, formula selection, or major unit conversions.\n    *   If a small discrepancy exists (e.g., factor of 1.5-2), re-evaluate your assumptions for ambiguous properties and design intent. Consider common rounded values from textbooks.\n3.5 **Resolve Ambiguity:** If multiple approaches are valid, prioritize the answer that:\n    a) Most closely matches the order of magnitude of the options.\n    b) Is most common in standard textbooks for the context.\n    c) Results in an effect closest to the stated constraint value (e.g., head loss ≈ 4.8 ft, not 4.1 ft).\n4.  **Final Output:** After your reasoning, conclude with the final answer on a new line using this exact format:\n`Final Answer: [LETTER]`\nWhere `[LETTER]` is the single uppercase letter of the correct choice (e.g., A, B, J).\n\nNow, solve the following question:",

    "prompt": "You are an expert in causal reasoning. Carefully analyze the following causality question by rigorously following these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Perspective and Question Type:**\n    *   **Perspective:** Determine if the question asks for a **logician's answer** (apply formal causal models, e.g., structural equations, counterfactual dependence) or what **most people would say** (intuitive judgment based on salience and norms).\n    *   **Question Type:** Determine if the question is about a **necessary cause** (was the event required for the outcome?) or a **sufficient cause** (did the event guarantee the outcome?).\n\n2.  **Apply the Correct Counterfactual Test:**\n    *   For a **necessary cause:** Ask: \"If this specific event had **not** happened, would the outcome still have occurred **in the exact way it actually did**?\" Consider omissions: *Not acting* can be a necessary cause if acting would have prevented the outcome.\n    *   For a **sufficient cause:** Ask: \"If this specific event **had** happened, would the outcome **always** have followed, **holding all other relevant factors at their actual values**?\" A cause is not sufficient if its effect is contingent on another event that could have been different (e.g., a backup being stopped).\n\n3.  **Reason Step-by-Step:** Explicitly work through the scenario using the identified perspective and the correct counterfactual test. For logician sufficiency, scrutinize dependencies: if the effect requires an additional enabling condition that is not guaranteed by the cause itself, then the cause is not sufficient.\n\n4.  **Final Answer:** Conclude with **Yes**, **No**, or **Ambiguous**.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n\n**Example 1 (Logician - Necessity):**\n**Question:** Reagent X is added... Is adding Reagent X a necessary cause?\n**Reasoning (Logician):** The question is from a logician's perspective and is about necessity. The counterfactual test for necessity is: \"If Reagent X had *not* been added, would the crystal have dissolved *in the same way*?\" No, because the actual cause (X touching the crystal) would not have happened; the backup (Y) would have caused it, but that is a different causal pathway. In causal modeling, the actual initiator (X) is the cause, making it necessary for *this particular instance* of the effect.\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Example 2 (Majority - Necessity):**\n**Question:** ...Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position?\n**Reasoning (Majority):** The question asks what most people would say and is about necessity (of the inaction). The intuitive counterfactual is: \"If Wayne *had* changed the position, would the outcome be different?\" Yes, the device would not have been on the charging pad and would not have charged. Therefore, most people would say his *inaction* was a cause.\n**Answer: Yes**\n\n**Example 3 (Logician - Sufficiency - Failure Correction):**\n**Question:** Alice intends to fire a bullet at a window (AI). Bob intends to prevent Alice from hitting the window (BI). Bob tries to stop Alice (BSA). Bob is stopped by Carol (CSB). Alice fires a bullet (AF), hits the window (AH) and shatters it (WS). Is Alice firing the bullet a sufficient cause for the window shattering? Reply based on the answer a logician would give.\n**Reasoning (Logician):** The perspective is logician, and the question is about *sufficiency*. The test for sufficiency is: \"If Alice had fired the bullet (AF), would the window shattering (WS) *always* have followed?\" In the actual scenario, WS did follow, but this was contingent on Carol stopping Bob (CSB). For AF to be sufficient, it must guarantee WS without depending on another event like CSB. If Bob had *not* been stopped (i.e., if CSB were false), he might have prevented AF or AH. Therefore, AF's success is not independent; it relies on CSB. AF is not sufficient by itself; it is only sufficient in the specific context where CSB is true. A logician would therefore say it is not a sufficient cause.\n**Answer: No**\n\nNow, apply this rigorous process to the following new scenario.",

                "prompt": "You are an expert in causal reasoning. Your task is to analyze a scenario and a question. Your reasoning must be precise and adapt to the specific type of question asked.\n\n**Step 0: Classify the Question Type**\nFirst, determine what kind of answer is requested:\n-   **Type A: Formal Sufficiency:** The question asks for a judgment based purely on logical sufficiency (e.g., \"was this action a sufficient cause?\" or \"reply as a logician would\").\n-   **Type B: Folk Intuition:** The question asks for the judgment most people would make (e.g., \"reply based on what the majority would say\" or \"reply Yes or No based on the answer the majority of people would give\"). This often involves counterfactual reasoning and moral or social expectations.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Causal Rule**\nExtract the explicit or implicit rule that defines what causes the outcome. If the rule is implicit (e.g., \"lack of oil causes a machine to break down\"), state it clearly and note it is an assumption. Distinguish between deterministic rules (e.g., \"both switches must be flipped\") and probabilistic or contributory rules (e.g., \"not warning someone increases their risk of being hit\").\n\n**Step 2: Reason Based on Question Type**\n-   **For Type A (Formal Sufficiency):**\n    -   **Check for Sufficiency:** Determine if the specified action/event *by itself* was enough to satisfy the causal rule and produce the outcome. The presence of other potential or actual causes is irrelevant. An action is sufficient if its occurrence guarantees the outcome.\n    -   **Key Principles:** Pre-existing conditions are background. Overdetermination is allowed. Focus *only* on sufficiency, not necessity. For omissions, an omission is sufficient only if it alone guarantees the outcome, irrespective of any other possible preventing actions.\n-   **For Type B (Folk Intuition):**\n    -   **Check for Counterfactual Dependence:** Ask \"Would the outcome *not* have occurred if the action had *not* happened?\" (a 'but-for' test). If the answer is yes, people are likely to say the action caused the outcome.\n    -   **Consider Norms and Responsibilities:** Do social, moral, or role-based expectations (e.g., \"it was her responsibility\") affect how people assign cause? People often assign causality to omissions if the agent had a duty to act.\n    -   **Avoid Overdetermination:** People often discount a cause if another sufficient cause was present and actualized (e.g., \"the car would have started anyway without Billy\").\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Reasoning**\nBased on the reasoning in Step 2, answer **Yes** or **No**.\n\n**Step 4: Handle Uncertainty**\nAnswer **Ambiguous** only if the scenario lacks the information needed to determine the answer for the specified question type.\n\n**Examples of Correct Reasoning for Different Question Types:**\n\n**Example 1 (Type A - Formal Sufficiency):**\n*   **Scenario:** A lamp lights only if *both* switches A and B are flipped. Switch A was flipped. Switch B was not flipped.\n*   **Question:** Did flipping switch A cause the lamp to light? (Reply as a logician would.)\n*   **Reasoning:** Question Type is A (Formal Sufficiency). The explicit causal rule requires both switches. Flipping switch A alone was *not* sufficient to cause the lamp to light.\n*   **Answer:** No\n\n**Example 2 (Type B - Folk Intuition):**\n*   **Scenario:** Janet is responsible for oiling a machine. She forgets. Kate, who is not responsible but could have oiled it, also does nothing. The machine breaks down.\n*   **Question:** Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down? (Reply based on the majority of people.)\n*   **Reasoning:** Question Type is B (Folk Intuition). People use counterfactuals: *If* Kate had put oil in, the breakdown *would have been prevented*. They also consider norms: Kate had no responsibility to act. Therefore, the majority would likely not blame Kate's inaction as the cause, focusing instead on Janet's failure.\n*   **Answer:** No\n\n**Example 3 (Type B - Folk Intuition):**\n*   **Scenario:** A teammate (Zach) sees a hidden threat to another teammate (Harmon) but says nothing. Harmon is hit by the threat.\n*   **Question:** Was Harmon hit because Zach did not warn him? (Reply based on the majority of people.)\n*   **Reasoning:** Question Type is B (Folk Intuition). People use counterfactuals: *If* Zach had warned Harmon, he *might have avoided* the hit. People also consider team norms: teammates are expected to help each other. Therefore, the majority would likely say Zach's inaction was a cause.\n*   **Answer:** Yes\n\n**Example 4 (Type A - Formal Sufficiency):**\n*   **Scenario:** The car needs at least one battery. Billy buys and installs one battery. Suzy also buys and installs one battery. The car starts.\n*   **Question:** Was Billy buying the battery a sufficient cause for the car starting? (Reply as a logician would.)\n*   **Reasoning:** Question Type is A (Formal Sufficiency). The causal rule states that one battery is sufficient. Billy's action alone was enough to satisfy this rule, guaranteeing the outcome. The presence of Suzy's battery is irrelevant for sufficiency.\n*   **Answer:** Yes\n\nNow, apply this step-by-step reasoning to the following scenario. Begin by stating the Question Type.

Your task is to analyze a scenario and a question. **First, you must identify what type of causal question is being asked.** Then, apply the corresponding reasoning steps.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Question**\nRead the question carefully and classify it into one of these three types:\n*   **Type A: Sufficient Cause:** The question asks if an action was a \"sufficient cause\" or if it was \"enough by itself\" to cause the outcome.\n*   **Type B: Necessary Cause:** The question asks if an action was a \"necessary cause\" or if the outcome \"would not have happened without it.\"\n*   **Type C: Folk Causation:** The question asks for the answer \"the majority of people would give,\" what is \"intuitively\" the cause, or what a \"logician\" would say. This often blends actual causation with blame and norm violation.\n\n### **Step 2: Apply the Appropriate Reasoning**\n\n#### **For Type A Questions (Sufficient Cause):**\n1.  **Identify the Causal Rule:** Extract the explicit or implicit rule that defines what causes the outcome.\n2.  **Check for Sufficiency:** Determine if the action *by itself, under normal background conditions,* was enough to satisfy the causal rule. An action is sufficient if its occurrence guarantees the outcome.\n3.  **Check for Preemption:** A sufficient cause is **invalidated if it was preempted**. An action is preempted if another sufficient cause occurred and actually brought about the outcome *before* the first action could take effect. (e.g., A slow-acting poison is preempted by an immediate fatal shot).\n4.  **Apply the Rule:** If the action was sufficient and not preempted, answer **Yes**. Otherwise, answer **No**.\n5.  **Handle Uncertainty:** Answer **Ambiguous** only if critical information is missing.\n\n**Key Principles for Sufficiency:**\n*   **Pre-existing Conditions are Background:** Treat stable, unchanging conditions (e.g., unblocked tracks, gravity) as part of the background context. The action is the intervening factor.\n*   **Overdetermination is Allowed:** Multiple sufficient causes can exist. The existence of another sufficient cause does not negate the sufficiency of the action in question, **unless one preempts the other**.\n\n#### **For Type B Questions (Necessary Cause):**\n1.  **Identify the Causal Rule:** As above.\n2.  **Perform the Counterfactual Test:** Ask \"If the action had **not** occurred, would the outcome still have happened?\"\n    *   If the outcome would **not** have happened, then the action was necessary. Answer **Yes**.\n    *   If the outcome **would** have happened anyway (e.g., through another sufficient cause), then the action was not necessary. Answer **No**.\n3.  **Handle Uncertainty:** Answer **Ambiguous** if the counterfactual cannot be determined.\n\n#### **For Type C Questions (Folk Causation):**\n1.  **Identify the Normative Context:** Note if the action violated a rule, law, or social norm.\n2.  **Determine Intuitive Blame:** People are more likely to assign causation to an agent who acted intentionally, violated a norm, or set a chain of events in motion, even if the action was not strictly sufficient or necessary.\n3.  **Answer:** Based on the above, decide if the majority would answer **Yes** or **No**. If arguments for both sides are equally strong, answer **Ambiguous**.\n\n### **Examples of Correct Reasoning for Each Type:**\n\n**Type A Example (Sufficiency - Preemption):**\n*   **Scenario:** Reagent X is added, causing a slow explosion that would kill Sam in 1 hour. Meanwhile, Reagent Y (already in Sam's pocket) would kill him by infection in 45 minutes. Sam is shot and killed instantly at the 30-minute mark.\n*   **Question:** Was adding Reagent X a sufficient cause of Sam's death?\n*   **Reasoning:** (Type A) The rule: adding Reagent X causes a lethal explosion. However, the explosion was preempted by the faster, fatal gunshot. The action was not sufficient for the death that actually occurred.\n*   **Answer:** No\n\n**Type B Example (Necessity):**\n*   **Scenario:** Reagent X is added, causing an explosion that kills Sam. Otherwise, Reagent Y in Sam's pocket would have infected and killed him.\n*   **Question:** Was adding Reagent X a necessary cause of Sam's death?\n*   **Reasoning:** (Type B) The counterfactual: If Reagent X had not been added, Sam would have died from Reagent Y. Therefore, the action was not necessary.\n*   **Answer:** No\n\n**Type C Example (Folk Causation):**\n*   **Scenario:** Billy is not permitted to log in on Thursdays. He and Carol log in simultaneously, causing a breaker to fail (a rule that requires two simultaneous logins).\n*   **Question:** Did Billy cause the breaker to fail? (Reply based on what the majority would say.)\n*   **Reasoning:** (Type C) While Billy's action alone was not logically sufficient (it required Carol), he violated a clear rule. The majority would likely assign blame and causation to him.\n*   **Answer:** Yes\n\n### **Step 3: Generate Final Answer**\nClearly state your reasoning based on the question type and box your final answer.\n\n---\nNow, apply this step-by-step reasoning to the following scenario.

Follow these steps precisely:\n\n1.  **Classify the Question Type:** First, identify what type of causal question is being asked. The main types are:\n    *   **Sufficiency:** \"Was action X a **sufficient** cause?\" (Did X alone guarantee the outcome?)\n    *   **Necessity:** \"Was action X a **necessary** cause?\" (Would the outcome have happened **without** X?)\n    *   **General Causation:** \"Did action X **cause** the outcome?\" (This common phrasing requires analyzing causal contribution, often based on norms, responsibility, or counterfactual dependence.)\n\n2.  **Apply the Appropriate Reasoning Path:**\n\n    **A. For Sufficiency Questions:**\n    a.  **Identify the Causal Rule:** Extract the explicit or implicit rule that defines what causes the outcome.\n    b.  **Check for Sufficiency:** Determine if the specified action, *by itself*, was enough to satisfy this rule and produce the outcome. The existence of other potential causes is irrelevant.\n    c.  **Answer:** Based on this, answer **Yes** or **No**.\n\n    **B. For Necessity Questions:**\n    a.  **Understand the Causal Mechanism:** Identify all factors that led to the outcome.\n    b.  **Run the Counterfactual:** Ask \"If the specified action had **NOT** occurred, would the outcome **still** have happened?\"\n    c.  **Answer:** If the outcome would **NOT** have happened without the action, answer **Yes** (necessary). Otherwise, answer **No**.\n\n    **C. For General Causation Questions:**\n    a.  **Check for Causal Contribution:** Evaluate if the action was a substantial factor in bringing about the outcome. Consider:\n        i.  **Ability and Opportunity:** Could the actor have prevented the outcome?\n        ii. **Normative Responsibility:** Was it the actor's role or duty to act?\n        iii. **Counterfactual Dependence:** Would the outcome have been different if the actor had behaved differently?\n    b.  **Answer:** Synthesize these factors to answer **Yes** or **No**. If the question specifies (e.g., \"what most people would say\"), base your answer on that common intuition.\n\n3.  **Handle Uncertainty:** Answer **Ambiguous** only if the scenario critically lacks the information needed to complete the required reasoning steps.\n\n**Key Principles to Follow:**\n-   **Sufficiency ≠ Necessity:** These are distinct concepts. Always use the test that matches the question.\n-   **Pre-existing Conditions are Background:** Treat stable, pre-existing conditions as part of the context. The action in question is the variable factor.\n-   **Overdetermination is Allowed:** Multiple sufficient causes can exist for a single outcome. The existence of another cause does not negate the sufficiency or necessity of the action in question.\n-   **Omissions Can Be Causes:** A failure to act can be a cause, especially if there was a duty or a clear opportunity to act.\n\n**Examples of Correct and Incorrect Reasoning:**\n\n**Example 1 (Sufficiency - Correct):**\n*   **Scenario:** A profit is made if *anyone* buys coffee. Drew, Kylie, and Oliver all bought coffee.\n*   **Question:** Was Drew's purchase a **sufficient** cause of the profit?\n*   **Reasoning:** The rule is that any purchase is sufficient. Drew's purchase alone guaranteed the profit.\n*   **Answer:** Yes\n\n**Example 2 (Necessity - Correct):**\n*   **Scenario:** The window shatters only if hit by two bullets. Alice and Bob fire simultaneously, both hitting the window.\n*   **Question:** Was Alice firing the bullet a **necessary** cause of the window shattering?\n*   **Reasoning:** If Alice had not fired, only one bullet would have hit. The window would not have shattered.\n*   **Answer:** Yes\n\n**Example 3 (General Causation - Avoiding Error):**\n*   **Scenario:** Janet is responsible for oiling a machine but forgets. Kate, who is not responsible but knows how, also does not oil it. The machine breaks down.\n*   **Question:** Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down? (Reply based on majority intuition)\n*   **Reasoning:** This is a General Causation question. While Kate's inaction was not sufficient (Janet's failure was also needed), most people would focus on normative responsibility. Since it was not Kate's job or duty, the majority would not blame her. Her inaction is not seen as a cause.\n*   **Answer:** No\n\n**Example 4 (General Causation - Avoiding Error):**\n*   **Scenario:** A motion detector triggers if more than one person is present.

However, Drew's purchase was sufficient by itself to cause the profit. Since the other causes were simultaneous, Drew's action is still a cause.\n*   **Answer:** Yes\n\n**Example 2: (No Causation - Missing Necessary Condition)**\n*   **Scenario:** A lamp lights only if *both* switches A and B are flipped. Switch A was flipped.

The car explosion was a direct, intervening event that preempted the poison.\n*   **Answer:** No\n\n**Example 4: (Joint Causation - Multiple Necessary Causes)**\n*   **Scenario:** A fire requires both fuel and oxygen. Alice accidentally spills fuel (insufficient alone). Bob accidentally opens a window, letting in oxygen (insufficient alone). The fuel and oxygen combine, starting a fire.\n*   **Question:** Did Bob opening the window cause the fire?\n*   **Reasoning:** The outcome is \"a fire started.\" But-for Bob's action, the fire would not have started (as there was no oxygen). But-for Alice's action, the fire would not have started (as there was no fuel). Both actions were individually insufficient but jointly necessary and sufficient. There is no preemption.\n*   **Answer:** Yes\n\n**Example of Incorrect Reasoning to Avoid:**\n*   **Scenario:** (The provided gardener scenario)\n*   **Mistake:** Incorrectly defining the outcome as \"drying in areas where both chemicals were applied\" sabotages the but-for test by building the cause into the effect. The correct outcome is \"the plants dried up.\" But-for Benni's action, would plants have dried up? Yes, because Alex applied A X200R which was potentially harmful on its own (as per the magazine's warning about \"chemicals\"). This is a case of joint causation where both applications were likely necessary for *this specific harm*, but harm (from Alex's action) may have occurred anyway.\n*   **Correct Analysis:** The answer is often **Ambiguous** or **No** based on common intuition, as the primary fault lies with Alex for failing to instruct Benni, making Benni's action a non-deviant, expected part of the process that only became harmful due to another's failure.\n\nNow, apply this step-by-step reasoning to the following scenario.

Do not stop here.\n\n2.  **Sufficiency & Overdetermination:** Was the action **enough by itself** to cause the outcome? Were there **other actions or events** that were also sufficient to cause the same outcome?\n    *   In cases with multiple sufficient causes (e.g., two shooters), people typically consider **each sufficient action** to be a cause, even if not strictly necessary.\n\n3.  **Causal Contribution (INUS Condition):** Was the action an **insufficient but necessary part of a set of conditions** that was itself unnecessary but sufficient for the outcome? (e.g., one chemical in a harmful mixture). If yes, it is considered a cause.\n\n4.  **Proximal Cause (Superseding Cause):** After the action, did an **independent, highly unexpected, or negligent event** occur that directly caused the outcome? If yes, this may break the chain of causation from the original action.\n\n5.  **Foreseeability & Context:** Should a reasonable person have anticipated that the action could lead to this outcome? Lack of foreseeability makes it less likely to be seen as a cause, even if the action was technically necessary.\n\n**Final Judgment:** Synthesize the above. An action is considered a cause if it was either:\n*   **(a) Necessary** for the outcome, or\n*   **(b) Sufficient** for the outcome, or\n*   **(c) A necessary part of a sufficient set** of conditions for the outcome.\n\n**Avoid Common Errors:**\n- **Error 1 (Over-relying on But-For):** In a scenario where multiple sufficient causes exist (e.g., three people order coffee; only one is needed for a profit), do not conclude \"No\" solely because the action was not necessary. The action is still a sufficient contributor, and most people would say it **did** cause the outcome.\n- **Error 2 (Ignoring Joint Necessity):** In a scenario where a combination of factors causes harm (e.g., two chemicals must mix to damage plants), an action that provides one necessary part of that combination **is** a cause. Do not overlook this because the action alone was not sufficient.\n- **Error 3 (Confusing Sufficiency & Necessity):** An action can be a sufficient cause (e.g., firing a bullet that shatters a window) even if the outcome would have happened anyway due to another sufficient cause.

The preempting cause is the necessary cause.\n\n3.  **Causal Contribution (INUS Condition):** Was the action an **insufficient but necessary part of a set of conditions** that was itself unnecessary but sufficient for the outcome? (e.g., one chemical in a harmful mixture). This is a technical cause.\n\n4.  **Proximal Cause (Superseding Cause):** After the action, did an **independent, highly unexpected, or negligent event** occur that directly caused the outcome? If yes, this may break the chain of causation from the original action.\n\n5.  **Normality and Fault:** Was the action a **normal, expected, or prescribed** part of the situation? Or was it a **deviant, faulty, or rule-breaking** action? People are far more likely to assign causation to deviant actions than to normal background conditions, even if both are technically necessary.\n\n6.  **Foreseeability & Context:** Should a reasonable person, with the knowledge available to the actor, have anticipated that the action could lead to this outcome? **Lack of foreseeability strongly reduces the perception of causation.** An action that was normal and unforeseeable is likely to be seen as a mere condition, not a cause.\n\n**Final Judgment:** Synthesize the above. A thoughtful majority considers an action a cause if it was a necessary or sufficient factor **and** it was deviant/faulty **or** the outcome was reasonably foreseeable. They are unlikely to see a normal, non-faulty, and unforeseeable action as a cause, even if it is technically a but-for condition.\n\n**Avoid Common Errors:**\n- **Error 1 (Over-relying on But-For):** Do not conclude \"No\" solely because an action was not necessary if it was sufficient (e.g., one of three coffee orders). But in cases of **preemption**, the but-for test for the *actual outcome* is decisive.\n- **Error 2 (Ignoring Joint Necessity):** In a scenario where a combination of factors causes harm, an action that provides one necessary part **is** a technical cause. However, weigh this against Normality and Fault (Step 5).\n- **Error 3 (Confusing Logical and Folk Causation):** The question asks for the majority view. If strict logic (e.g., INUS) conflicts with strong intuitions about fault and normality, prioritize the folk intuition. A normal, unforeseeable action is rarely seen as a \"cause\" by most people.\n- **Error 4 (Misapplying Overdetermination):** Do not treat preemptive causes (bus/truck) as symmetric overdetermination (two shooters). They are different.\n\n**Examples to Guide Your Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Example A (Preemption):** Alice pushes Bob in front of a truck, killing him. If she hadn't, a bus would have killed him moments later. A majority would say Alice's push **was** the cause of Bob's death (it preempted the bus and was the but-for cause of death *by truck*). The bus is irrelevant to the actual outcome.\n*   **Example B (Normality):** Billy (forbidden) and Suzy (permitted) log in simultaneously, causing a deletion. A majority would say Billy's deviant action **was** a cause, but Suzy's normal, rule-following action **was not**, even though both are technically necessary. Her action is a background condition, not a cause.\n\nAfter reasoning, provide your final answer. Answer with exactly one word: **Yes**, **No**, or **Ambiguous**.",

Specifically, was there **another distinct action or event**—an alternative sufficient cause—that was certain or very likely to happen and would have caused the **same outcome** if the action had not been taken? If yes, this significantly reduces the likelihood that people will see the action as a cause.\n\n3.  **Sufficiency & Overdetermination:** Was the action **enough by itself** to cause the outcome? Were there **other actions or events** that were also sufficient to cause the same outcome?\n    *   In cases with multiple sufficient causes (e.g., two shooters), people typically consider **each sufficient action** to be a cause, **unless** an alternative cause makes the outcome inevitable (as evaluated in Step 2).\n\n4.  **Causal Contribution (INUS Condition):** Was the action an **insufficient but necessary part of a set of conditions** that was itself unnecessary but sufficient for the outcome? (e.g., one chemical in a harmful mixture). If yes, it is evidence for causation.\n\n5.  **Active Cause vs. Background Condition:** Was the action an **active, specific intervention** that changed the status quo? Or was it a **passive element, a standing condition, or a normative action** (e.g., following instructions)? People are much more likely to assign causation to active, deviant, or faulty interventions.\n\n6.  **Proximal Cause (Superseding Cause):** After the action, did an **independent, highly unexpected, or negligent event** occur that directly caused the outcome? If yes, this may break the chain of causation from the original action.\n\n7.  **Foreseeability, Norms, and Intent:** Should a reasonable person have anticipated that the action could lead to this outcome? Did the actor **intend** for the outcome to occur? Was the action a **violation of a rule or norm**, or was it in accordance with standard practice? Lack of foreseeability, intent, or the presence of rule-following makes it less likely to be seen as a cause.\n\n**Final Judgment:** Synthesize the above. An action is considered a cause if the evidence from necessity, sufficiency, or INUS contribution is strong **and** is supported by it being an active intervention and norm-breaking. Crucially, if the outcome was **inevitable** due to a preempted alternative cause (Step 2), the action is less likely to be seen as a cause, even if it was sufficient or an INUS condition.\n\n**Avoid Common Errors:**\n- **Error 1 (Over-relying on But-For):** In a scenario with multiple sufficient causes, do not conclude \"No\" solely because the action was not necessary. However, if the outcome was inevitable from an alternative cause, do not conclude \"Yes\" solely because the action was sufficient.\n- **Error 2 (Ignoring Inevitability):** In a scenario where the outcome was inevitable (e.g., a boss ordering one of two poisonous dishes), the specific action is often not seen as a cause. The majority focuses on the inevitability, not the specific sufficient action.\n- **Error 3 (Confusing Cause and Condition):** Do not classify a normal, rule-following, or background action as a cause simply because it was a necessary part of a physical process. People often reserve the label \"cause\" for the abnormal, faulty, or active element.\n- **Error 4 (Misapplying INUS):** An action being an INUS condition is a necessary but not sufficient reason for people to call it a cause. It must also be an active intervention and not just a passive condition.\n\n**Few-Shot Examples for Guidance:**\n\n**Example 1 (Inevitability):**\n*   **Scenario:** A boss orders one of two dishes, both containing a fatal allergen. The employee eats it and dies.\n*   **Majority View:** **No**, the boss's choice did not cause the death. The outcome was inevitable; the other dish would have also killed the employee.\n*   **Reasoning:** The but-for test fails (Step 1: Yes, outcome would have occurred). The outcome was inevitable due to a preempted alternative cause (Step 2). Therefore, the specific action is not considered causal.\n\n**Example 2 (Active Cause vs. Condition):**\n*   **Scenario:** Two gardeners are told to use only Chemical A. Gardener 1 uses Chemical A correctly. Gardener 2 errantly uses Chemical B. The mixture of A and B kills the plants.\n*   **Majority View:** **No**, Gardener 1's fertilization did not cause the plants to dry out.\n*   **Reasoning:** While Gardener 1's action was an INUS condition (Step 4), it was a normative, rule-following action (Step 5, 7). Gardener 2's deviant action is seen as the active cause. The majority distinguishes the \"cause\" (the error) from the \"condition\" (the correct action).\n\n**Example 3 (Symmetric Overdetermination):**\n*   **Scenario:** Alice and Bob simultaneously shoot bullets at a window. Either bullet alone would have shattered it.\n*   **Majority View:** **Yes**, Alice firing the bullet was a cause of the window shattering.\n*   **Reasoning:** The action was sufficient (Step 3). There is no preempted alternative that makes the outcome inevitable in a way that negates her action (Step 2). It was an active intervention (Step 5). This is a case where formal logic and majority view align.\n\nAfter reasoning, provide your final answer. Answer with exactly one word: **Yes**, **No**, or **Ambiguous**.",

However, the majority would focus on the pre-existing unlabeled container and the miscommunication as the salient causes, likely concluding Benni's action did **not** cause the outcome, as he was blameless and merely triggered a pre-existing hazard.\n-   **Error 3 (Misdirected Blame):** In a scenario where a nurse's medication error kills a terminally ill patient, do not over-weight the distal cause (the illness).

Note if the question uses specific terms like \"sufficient cause\" or asks for a specific perspective (e.g., \"a logician would give\"), as this fundamentally changes the required reasoning.\n\n**IF THE QUESTION IS ABOUT FORMAL LOGIC (e.g., \"sufficient cause\", \"necessary cause\", \"a logician would say\"):**\n*   **L1. Define Terms Formally:**\n    *   A **necessary cause** is an event without which the outcome would not have occurred.\n    *   A **sufficient cause** is an event that, by itself and under all circumstances, guarantees the outcome.\n    *   Many causes are **INUS conditions**: an **I**nsufficient but **N**ecessary part of a **U**nnecessary but **S**ufficient set of conditions.\n*   **L2.

Answer: **No**.\n-   **Example 2 (Formal Sufficiency):** Adding the last drop of water to a full sink causes it to overflow. A logician would reason: The last drop is **not a sufficient cause** by itself, as its effect depends entirely on the pre-existing condition of the sink being full. It is a necessary part of a sufficient set (an INUS condition). Answer: **No**.\n-   **Example 3 (Innocent Trigger):** An employee innocently triggers a pre-existing hazard (e.g., an unlabeled harmful chemical) based on a colleague's mistake.

If so, the original action may still be a cause if it made the outcome happen earlier.\n    *   **Omissions by Others:** Could someone else have prevented the outcome? Does that person have a *responsibility* to act? If another capable agent could have easily prevented the outcome but had no duty to do so, this may make causal attribution to the first agent more ambiguous.\n    *   **Pre-existing Conditions:** Was a dangerous situation or rule violation already in place?\n\n**3. Proximity and Intervention:** Was the action a direct trigger? To determine if an intervening event breaks the chain of causation from the original action, it must be:\n    *   **Highly Unexpected:** Not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the original action.\n    *   **Malicious or Grossly Negligent:** A deliberate criminal act or egregious error by a third party.\n    Merely being the last event in a sequence is not enough to break the chain. A pre-emptive cause (which acts first) is still a cause.\n\n**4. Foreseeability & Responsibility:** Could a reasonable person in the actor's position, with their knowledge, have anticipated this outcome? Did the actor have a *duty* and *control* over the situation? For omissions, the *duty to act* is paramount.\n\n**5. Determine Causal Attribution:** The majority of people assign causation based on:\n    *   **Duty and Breach:** A failure to fulfill a clear duty is strongly causal.\n    *   **Intent and Negligence:** A deliberate or negligent act is more salient than an innocent or unforeseeable one.\n    *   **Proximity:** A recent event is often weighted heavily, but a deliberate, pre-meditated action remains highly salient even if pre-empted by another event.\n    Avoid the pitfall of selecting only one \"main\" cause. A \"Yes\" answer means the action was *a* cause, even if other causes were also present.\n\n**Final Check:** Synthesize all steps. If the action was a necessary factor (Step 1), no unforeseeable intervention broke the chain (Step 3), and the actor had responsibility/foreseeability (Step 4), answer Yes. If a superseding cause clearly breaks the chain or another agent's omission (without duty) is the salient factor, answer No. If responsibilities are blurred or causes are equally balanced (e.g., two independent negligent omissions), answer Ambiguous.\n\n**Answer with exactly one word: Yes, No, or Ambiguous.**\n\n**Critical Examples to Guide Your Reasoning:**\n\n-   **Error 1 (Pre-emption Misapplication):** If Alice poisons Bob (lethal in 1 hour) and Charlie shoots Bob dead 30 minutes later, the shooting is the proximate cause of death *at that moment*. However, the majority would still say Alice's poisoning **caused** his death—it was a lethal action that would have resulted in death. The shooting pre-empted it but did not erase its causal status. (Answer should be **Yes**, the poisoning was a cause).\n-   **Error 2 (Omission & Shared Capacity):** If Janet (responsible) fails to oil a machine, and Kate (not responsible but capable) also fails to oil it, the machine breaks down. The \"but-for\" test passes for Janet. However, because Kate *could have* prevented the outcome but had no duty to, the majority's attribution to Janet alone is **ambiguous**; they might see it as a shared or system failure.\n-   **Error 3 (Duty Trumps Proximity):** A nurse's medication error kills a terminally ill patient. The illness is a pre-existing condition, but the nurse's breach of duty is the proximate and salient cause. The majority would say the error **caused** the death. Do not over-weight the distal cause.\n\nNow, apply the reasoning steps to the given scenario.",

The test is: \"If Alice had flicked the switch, would the train have always arrived?\" The arrival is overdetermined; it happens on either track. Flicking the switch changes the track from B to A. For the switch flick to be sufficient, it must guarantee arrival *on its own merit*. If Track A were blocked (a possible variation we must consider, as it is not a consequence of flicking the switch), the train would not arrive. Therefore, the success of the flicking action is contingent on the state of Track A, which is not guaranteed by the action itself. It is not a sufficient cause.\n**Answer: No**\n\n**Example 5 (Logician - Sufficiency - Preemption):**\n**Question:** ...Is Alice firing the bullet a sufficient cause for the window shattering?\n**Reasoning (Logician):** The perspective is logician, question is sufficiency. The test is: \"If Alice had fired the bullet, would the window have always shattered?\" We hold constant background conditions (e.g., physics, the window being intact beforehand) and the fact that Bob's bullet is late. Alice's action of firing initiates a deterministic sequence: the bullet travels and hits the window, causing it to shatter. This sequence does not rely on any other *contingent* event (like someone else's action). The presence of Bob's bullet is irrelevant as it is preempted. Therefore, Alice's firing is sufficient for the shattering.\n**Answer: Yes**\n\nNow, apply this rigorous process to the following new scenario.",

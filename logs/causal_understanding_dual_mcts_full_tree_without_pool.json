    "prompt": "You are given a scenario about causality. Your task is to decide whether the action described caused the outcome. Final answer with **Yes**, **No**, or **Ambiguous**.\n\n**Reasoning Framework:**\n1.  **Identify the Question Type:** Determine if the question asks for a *logical* assessment (e.g., \"necessary cause\", \"sufficient cause\") or an *intuitive* assessment (e.g., \"did it cause?\", \"what would most people say?\"). This dictates the entire reasoning path.\n2.  **If the question is an INTUITIVE assessment (what most people would say):**\n    *   **A. Assess Duty & Normality:** Was the agent **supposed to** prevent the outcome? An agent failing their duty is a strong signal for causation (**Yes**). An agent with no duty is a strong signal against causation (**No**). **The absence of duty is a powerful factor that can make a counterfactually necessary action *not* seem causal.**\n    *   **B. Assess Outcome Valence:** Is the outcome positive (e.g., a light turning on) or negative (e.g., a system failing)? For negative outcomes with no duty, people are hesitant to assign blame to any one individual in symmetric scenarios.\n    *   **C. Apply the Counterfactual (But-For) Test:** Ask: \"Would the outcome have occurred **if the specific action had NOT happened**?\" This identifies necessary conditions.\n    *   **D. Check for Symmetry & Primacy:** Are multiple agents in identical positions (same duty, same action, same time)? In cases of **true symmetry** with a negative outcome and no duty, people's judgments are split; they see it as a collective accident (**Ambiguous**). If one agent acted first, people often assign more causation to that agent.\n    *   **E. Synthesize Intuition:** Combine these signals. **Duty is the primary cue.** A counterfactually necessary action by an agent with no duty in a symmetric scenario is typically **not** seen as causal by the majority (**No** or **Ambiguous**).\n3.  **If the question is a LOGICAL assessment (e.g., \"necessary cause\"):**\n    *   **A. Apply the Counterfactual (But-For) Test:** Ask: \"Would the outcome have occurred **if the specific action had NOT happened**?\" If the answer is no, the action is a necessary cause.\n    *   **B. Check for Preemption:** If multiple sufficient causes are possible, identify which event *first* directly produced the outcome. **A *potential* cause that is thwarted does not count as preemption; only an actualized alternative sufficient cause negates necessity.**\n    *   **C. Synthesize Logically:** Determine if the action was necessary. **In cases of symmetric overdetermination (e.g., two simultaneous sufficient causes), neither action is necessary (No).**\n4.  **Final Judgment:** For intuitive questions, ask: \"Based on duty, outcome valence, counterfactuals, and symmetry, what would the majority of people conclude?\"\n\n**Learn from Key Examples:**\n*   **Duty Overrides Counterfactual:** An employee *with duty* forgets to oil a machine. People say **Yes**. Another employee *with no duty* doesn't oil the same machine. People say **No**.\n*   **Logical Necessity & Preemption:** If an outcome would have happened anyway due to an independent sufficient cause, the action is **not** a necessary cause (**No**).\n*   **Symmetric Intuition (Negative Outcome):** Two employees with no duty perform simultaneous necessary actions for a negative outcome (e.g., crashing a server). People are split; the intuitive answer is **Ambiguous**. They do not say **Yes** for one individual.\n*   **NEW: Symmetric Intuition (Positive Outcome):** Two people simultaneously flip switches that together turn on a light. For this positive outcome, people are more likely to say each person caused it (**Yes**).\n\n**Avoid Common Mistakes:**\n*   **Mistake:** In intuitive judgments for negative outcomes, over-relying on the counterfactual test when duty is absent and the case is symmetric. This leads to an incorrect **Yes**.\n*   **Correction:** Let the absence of duty and the presence of symmetry guide you toward **Ambiguous** or **No**. The counterfactual test is secondary in these cases.\n\n**Output Format:** Always end your response with `<answer>Yes</answer>`, `<answer>No</answer>`, or `<answer>Ambiguous</answer>`.",

Base your answer on the common-sense judgment that the majority of people would have.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n1.  **Identify Key Elements:** Clearly state the specific action/inaction being evaluated and the specific outcome in question.\n2.  **Check Plausibility:** Confirm it is reasonable that the action/inaction could lead to the outcome based on the story's rules and common sense.\n3.  **Apply Counterfactual Test:** Would the outcome likely have been avoided **if the specific action had not occurred** or **if the inaction had been an action**? If no, then it is not a cause. (This is a necessary but not always sufficient condition).\n4.  **Analyze Causal Structure:**\n    *   **Sole Cause:** Was the action the only thing needed for the outcome?\n    *   **Joint Cause:** Were other actions/events also required to happen **at the same time** for the outcome to occur? If yes, the action is still a cause, but the answer may depend on if the question singles out one agent.\n    *   **Proximate vs. Distant Cause:** Is the action the most direct and immediate trigger, or is it a distant, underlying factor? For the specific outcome and timing mentioned, the proximate cause is often what people identify.\n5.  **Consider Norms and Roles:** Did the actor have a **clear duty** to act, either based on explicit rules or **implicit expectations** (e.g., being a teammate, having unique knowledge)? The absence of a formal rule does not always mean no causality from inaction.\n6.  **Synthesize Majority View:** Weigh all factors. A necessary action (Step 3) is a cause, but if it was one of several joint causes (Step 4), the majority might not attribute causality if the question focuses on one agent. If a more proximate cause exists (Step 4), it often overshadows a distant one. A breach of a strong expectation (Step 5) can make an action causal in the majority view.\n\n**Learn from Examples:**\n*   **Example A (Shared Fault):** If two people must act simultaneously to cause a failure, and one was forbidden to act, most people would still say **both** actions caused the outcome. Therefore, asking if just one person's action caused it would be answered **No** or **Ambiguous**.\n*   **Example B (Teamwork):** Even without a formal rule, teammates are expected to warn each other of hidden dangers. Failure to warn (**inaction**) can be seen as a cause of harm by most people, leading to **Yes**.\n*   **Example C (Proximate Cause):** If a pre-existing condition (like a terminal illness) made someone vulnerable, but a separate, accidental event (like a medical error) directly caused death at that moment, most people would say the job caused the illness but **not** the *premature death*; the accident did. The answer would be **No**.\n\n**Final Answer Format:**\nAfter your reasoning, provide your final answer within the tags `<answer>Yes</answer>`, `<answer>No</answer>`, or `<answer>Ambiguous</answer>`.",

Skip other steps.\n    - For \"majority view\" or \"because\" questions:\n        - If the action was **not** a cause-in-fact (Step 2), answer **No**.\n        - If the action **was** a cause-in-fact, and it is **salient/blameworthy** (Step 3) OR the outcome was **foreseeable** (Step 4) OR the person was **at fault** (Step 5), and there is **no strong intervening cause**, answer **Yes**.\n        - If the action was a cause-in-fact but it is **not salient**, the person had **no fault**, the outcome was **not foreseeable**, **AND/OR** a strong **intervening cause** exists, answer **No**.\n        - If the scenario involves **overdetermination** (e.g., two sufficient causes) or other factors where reasonable people could strongly disagree on salience or blame, answer **Ambiguous**.\n\n**Special Instructions and Examples:**\n- **Inaction as Cause:** Inaction can be a cause if acting would have prevented the outcome (i.e., it fails the But-For test).\n- **Handling \"Because\":** For questions phrased as \"did X happen because of Y?\", consider if Y was the actual reason or trigger, not just a necessary condition. People often attribute causation to the first sufficient cause in a narrative.\n    - *Example: In a disjunctive scenario (e.g., \"win if A or B happens\"), if both A and B happen, people might say the win was \"because of A\" if it happened first, making the answer **Ambiguous**.*\n- **Intervening Causes:** A new, independent cause (e.g., a deliberate malicious act or a grossly negligent error) can break the chain of causation, leading people to say the original action did **not** cause the outcome.\n    - *Example: If a terminal patient is killed by a negligent nurse, many people would say the nurse caused the death, not the original illness.*\n- **Majority View Intuition:** People often prioritize rule-breaking, intentionality, and narrative order over pure logic. An action that violates a directive (e.g., taking a pen when forbidden) may be seen as the cause even if others contributed.\n\n**Final Answer Format:**\nAfter your reasoning, provide your final answer within the tags: `<answer>Yes</answer>`, `<answer>No</answer>`, or `<answer>Ambiguous</answer>`.",

This determines your analytical framework.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n1.  **Identify the Action and Outcome:** Precisely state the specific action/inaction and the outcome.\n2.  **Establish Factual Causation (But-For Test):** Determine if the outcome would *not* have occurred if the action had *not* happened.

            "prompt": "You are an expert in causal reasoning. Analyze the given scenario and question carefully. Your final answer must be exactly **Yes**, **No**, or **Ambiguous**.\n\n### Crucial First Step: Interpret the Question\n-   Identify the specific framing of the question. Are you to reason as a **logician** (focusing on necessity/sufficiency), from a **majority/common-sense** perspective, or based on **responsibility/duty**?\n-   Note the exact causal term used: e.g., \"a cause\", \"the cause\", \"sufficient cause\".\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Scenario:** Identify the outcome and all relevant actions and inactions.\n2.  **Apply the Appropriate Lens:**\n    *   **For a Logician's View:** Strictly apply counterfactual and logical tests.\n        -   **Necessary Cause:** Would the outcome have occurred **without** the action? If no, then the action is a necessary cause.\n        -   **Sufficient Cause:** If the action occurs, does the outcome **must** occur? If yes, then it is a sufficient cause.\n    *   **For a Majority/Common-Sense View:** Simulate how most people would interpret the story. People often assign cause to the most **salient, intentional, or unexpected** action, or to the person who had the **last clear chance** to prevent the outcome. Avoid over-relying on technicalities.\n    *   **For a Responsibility-Based View:** Evaluate duty, foreseeability, and preventable alternatives. Did the person have a clear obligation to act? Was the outcome a foreseeable result of their action/inaction?\n3.  **Avoid Common Pitfalls:**\n    -   An action can be a cause even if it is not the *only* cause.\n    -   Do not confuse *causing* an outcome with being *blameworthy* for it.\n    -   A sufficient cause is not negated by the existence of other sufficient causes.\n4.  **Synthesize:** Based on the chosen lens, conclude if the specified action was a cause of the outcome.\n\n### Few-Shot Examples for Guidance:\n\n**Example 1 (Logician - Sufficient Cause):**\n**Question:** Sam intends to add Reagent X... Is Sam not adding Reagent X a sufficient cause for mixture not exploding? Reply based on the answer a logician would give.\n**Reasoning (Logician View):** A logician defines a sufficient cause as one that guarantees the outcome. The non-explosion is guaranteed if Reagent X is not added, because the explosion requires X. Sam's inaction (not adding X) is therefore a sufficient cause for the non-explosion. Bob's action is a separate, independent sufficient cause.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>\n\n**Example 2 (Majority View):**\n**Question:** Claire's parents bought her an old computer... Did Claire cause the computer crash? Reply based on the answer the majority of people would give.\n**Reasoning (Majority View):** The repairman's confusion (\"I see Daniel was logged on...\") implies he is looking for the second user. Most people, hearing this, would reason that the crash was caused by *two people* being logged on. Claire's action (logging on or remaining logged on) is therefore seen as a joint cause alongside Daniel's action. The majority view would not absolve her completely.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>Ambiguous</answer> (or <answer>Yes</answer>, as views would be split)\n\n**Example 3 (Majority View):**\n**Question:** Bill's wife, Sue... Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set of bookends? Reply based on the answer the majority of people would give.\n**Reasoning (Majority View):** The narrative centers on Sue's intention and action. She identified the desire, found the left bookend, and executed her plan. Bill's action, while necessary for the outcome, was independent, unrequested, and coincidental. Most people would attribute the outcome to Sue's plan and say Bill *enabled* or *helped* complete the set, but did not *cause* them to possess it.\n**Final Answer:** <answer>No</answer>\n\n### Final Answer Format:\nAfter your reasoning, provide your final answer within the tags: `<answer>Yes</answer>`, `<answer>No</answer>`, or `<answer>Ambiguous</answer>`.",

A backup guard (also with duty) also fails. A theft occurs. Intuitively, the first guard's failure is still a cause (**Yes**), though blame may be shared.\n\n**Avoid Common Mistakes:**\n*   **Mistake:** Using the But-For test to assess sufficiency. **Correction:** The But-For test is for *necessity*.

Final answer with **Yes**, **No**, or **Ambiguous**.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**\n- **For intuitive judgments (\"what would most people say?\"):** People's intuition incorporates factors like **agency, intent, blame, and normality**. A necessary enabler might not be seen as the \"cause\" if it was normal, innocent, or secondary to a more salient event.\n- **For logical judgments (\"necessary cause\", \"sufficient cause\"):** Base your analysis **strictly on the actual sequence of events that occurred**. Alternative, unactualized possibilities are irrelevant for determining causation in the specific instance.\n\n**Reasoning Framework:**\n\n0.  **Parse the Scenario:** Identify all key actions and events. Clearly separate what *actually happened* from hypothetical alternatives mentioned in the scenario.\n\n1.  **Identify the Question Type:**\n    *   Does it ask for a *logical* assessment (e.g., \"necessary cause\", \"sufficient cause\")? → Use strict logical analysis.\n    *   Does it ask for an *intuitive* assessment (e.g., \"did it cause?\", \"what would most people say?\")? → Incorporate intuitive factors like intent and normality.\n\n2.  **Apply the Counterfactual (But-For) Test Correctly:**\n    *   Ask: \"In the closest possible world where the specific action did **not** occur, but all other pre-existing conditions and background facts remain the same, would the outcome have occurred?\"\n    *   **If No**, then the action was a cause. (Lean toward **Yes**)\n    *   **If Yes**, then the action was not a cause. (Lean toward **No**)\n    *   If the answer is unclear or unknowable, lean toward **Ambiguous**.\n    *   **IMPORTANT:** For logical questions, this test must be applied to the *actual world sequence*. Do not reason about a world where the action was never an option unless the scenario implies that.\n\n3.  **Check for Preemption:** If multiple causes are possible, identify which event *first* and *directly* produced the outcome in the actual sequence. A preempting cause is sufficient; subsequent or alternative events are irrelevant.\n\n4.  **Check for Symmetric Actors (For Intuitive Judgments):** If the outcome required multiple, simultaneous, identical actions (e.g., two people flipping a switch), consider that most people attribute causation to the *event* (both acting) rather than to any single individual. The answer for one individual is often **No**.\n\n5.  **Synthesize:**\n    *   **For logical sufficiency/necessity:** Determine if the action alone guarantees the outcome (sufficient) or if the outcome would not have occurred in the actual world without it (necessary).\n    *   **For intuitive causation:** Synthesize the result of the counterfactual test with considerations of intent, blame, and agency. Does the action feel like the salient 'cause' to a reasonable person?\n\n**Avoid Common Mistakes:**\n- **Mistake 1:** Do not confuse a cause being necessary *in a specific instance* with a condition being necessary *for an outcome type in general*. Unactualized alternative pathways do not negate a cause's necessity in the actual event.\n- **Mistake 2:** Do not over-rely on the counterfactual test for intuitive judgments without considering human factors like intent (e.g., an innocent, independent action completing a set created by a theft is not seen by most as the cause).\n- **Mistake 3:** In symmetric cases (e.g., two people overloading a circuit simultaneously), the majority would not say one individual caused the outcome.\n\n**Output Format:** Always end your response with `<answer>Yes</answer>`, `<answer>No</answer>`, or `<answer>Ambiguous</answer>`.",

Based on the analysis of the failures and the evolutionary history of the prompt, here is a revised prompt designed to correct the identified issues and align the model's reasoning with human intuitive judgment.\n\n***\n\n### New Prompt\n\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Your task is to analyze a scenario and determine whether the majority of people would judge that the described action was the cause of the specified outcome. Your final answer must reflect common intuitive judgment, which often incorporates normative and counterfactual reasoning, not just strict logical proximity.\n\n**Follow these reasoning steps meticulously:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Action and Outcome:** Precisely define the action we are evaluating and the specific outcome in question.\n2.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test (But-For Test):** Ask: \"If the action had **NOT** occurred, would the outcome still have happened in the exact same way?\"\n    *   If the answer is **clearly YES**, then the action was **not a cause**; conclude **No**.\n    *   If the answer is **clearly NO**, then the action was a **necessary cause**; proceed to the next steps.\n    *   If the answer is **unclear or ambiguous**, proceed to the next steps.\n3.  **Check for Overdetermination/Redundancy:** Determine if the outcome was guaranteed to happen by other, independent events or actions. If multiple sufficient causes existed (e.g., three people were already going to order coffee), then a redundant action is typically **not** considered the cause by most people. This strongly suggests a **No** answer.\n4.  **Evaluate Normative Status:** Was the action a violation of a rule, norm, or expectation? People are significantly more likely to assign causality to abnormal, deviant, or negligent actions than to normal, routine, or rule-following ones. A norm-breaking action is a strong signal for a \"Yes\" answer, while a norm-following action is a weak one.\n5.  **Map the Causal Chain for Proximity:** Outline the sequence of events linking the action to the outcome. Identify the most immediate trigger.\n6.  **Check for Superseding Causes:** Determine if a new, independent, and unforeseen event occurred *after* the action that directly brought about the outcome. If such an event exists, it breaks the chain of causation from the original action.\n\n**Synthesize Your Judgment for the Majority View:**\nWeigh the results from all steps. The counterfactual test (Step 2) and overdetermination (Step 3) are often the most decisive factors for human intuition. A necessary, non-redundant, norm-violating action will almost always be seen as the cause.\n\n**Guidelines for Final Answer:**\n-   Answer **<answer>Yes</answer>** only if the action was necessary, non-redundant, and no superseding cause exists. Norm violation strengthens this judgment.\n-   Answer **<answer>No</answer>** if the action was unnecessary, redundant, or superseded. Norm adherence strengthens this judgment.\n-   Answer **<answer>Ambiguous</answer>** only if the evidence from the steps above is perfectly balanced and unclear (e.g., two identical norm-breaking actions), not merely because the chain is complex.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n\n*   **Example A (Norm Violation is Key):**\n    *   **Scenario:** \"Zoe violated policy by logging in at 9 am. Alice followed policy by logging in at 9:30 am. This caused two people to be logged in, triggering an automatic email. Did Alice cause the email?\"\n    *   **Reasoning:** But-for test: Would the email have been sent if Alice had not logged in? (No, because only one person would be logged in). However, would it have been sent if Zoe had not logged in early? (Also no). This is ambiguous. **Normative Evaluation** is critical: Zoe's action was the deviant violation; Alice's was normal. The outcome is more strongly attributed to the violation. **Overdetermination:** Not applicable.\n    *   **Majority Judgment:** <answer>No</answer> (People blame the rule-breaker, Zoe, not the rule-follower, Alice).\n\n*   **Example B (Overdetermination is Key):**\n    *   **Scenario:** \"Kylie, Oliver, and Jen always order coffee. Drew unexpectedly ordered too. The shop made a profit. Did Drew's order cause the profit?\"\n    *   **Reasoning:** **But-for test:** Would the profit have occurred if Drew had not ordered? (Yes, because the others were always going to order). The action was unnecessary. **Overdetermination:** The profit was guaranteed by others; Drew's action was redundant.\n    *   **Majority Judgment:** <answer>No</answer>\n\n**Now, analyze this scenario:**\n[Insert Scenario Here]\n**Question:** Did [Action] cause [Outcome]?",

People often:\n    -   See an action as causal **only if it changes the outcome** (it makes a difference).\n    -   Do **not** see an action as causal if it merely chooses between two identical outcomes.\n    -   Attribute cause to the most salient or deliberate actor, but **not** if the actors are symmetrical.\n    -   Neglect necessary background conditions (e.g., a pre-existing illness, a fixed system rule like a grading curve).\n\n**Guidelines for Final Answer:**\n-   **<answer>Yes</answer>** only if the action is necessary, salient, and makes a difference (fails the counterfactual test).\n-   **<answer>No</answer>** if the outcome would have happened anyway, or if the action is merely one symmetrical part of a joint cause.\n-   **<answer>Ambiguous</answer>** only if people would be genuinely split (e.g., 50/50), not just because the case is complex.\n\n**Learn from These Key Examples:**\n\n*   **Example (Two Logins):** If two people log in simultaneously to trigger an email, neither one's login is seen as *the* cause. People see it as a system rule. **Answer: No**\n*   **Example (Fatal Dish):** Choosing between two identical fatal dishes is not a cause of death. The cause is the shared property (wine), not the choice. **Answer: No**\n*   **Example (Redundant Causes):** If two bullets are fired at a window and either alone would shatter it, the first bullet to hit is not seen as the cause because the outcome would have happened anyway. **Answer: No**\n\n**Final Answer:** After your reasoning, provide your final answer as **<answer>Yes</answer>**, **<answer>No</answer>**, or **<answer>Ambiguous</answer>**.\n\n**Now, analyze this scenario:**\n[Insert Scenario Here]\n**Question:** Did [Action] cause [Outcome]?",

                "prompt": "You are an expert in causal reasoning and predicting human intuition. Your task is to analyze scenarios to determine what the majority of people would say about whether a specific action caused a specific outcome.\n\n**Follow these reasoning steps carefully:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Precisely define the event in question.\n2.  **Identify the Action:** Precisely define the event we are evaluating as a potential cause.\n3.  **Map the Causal Chain:** Outline the sequence of events linking the action to the outcome.\n4.  **Perform the Counterfactual Test (Most Important):** Critically ask: \"If the specific action had **not** happened, would the outcome **definitely not** have occurred at that time and in that way?\"\n    -   If the outcome would have happened **anyway** (e.g., due to an identical alternative), the action is **not** a cause. This is the core of majority intuition.\n5.  **Check for Symmetry and Alternatives:** Were other actions or conditions equally necessary? If the action is one of two perfectly symmetric causes, people are unlikely to single out one as *the* cause.\n6.  **Check for Superseding Causes:** Determine if a new, independent, and unforeseen event occurred after the action that directly brought about the outcome.\n7.  **Predict the Majority Judgment:** Synthesize the above. People see an action as causal only if it **changes the outcome**. They do **not** see it as causal if it merely chooses between identical outcomes or is one symmetrical part of a joint cause. They neglect necessary background conditions and attribute cause to the most salient, proximate, and deliberate actor.\n\n**Guidelines for Final Answer:**\n-   **<answer>Yes</answer>** only if the action is necessary and makes a difference (fails the counterfactual test).\n-   **<answer>No</answer>** if the outcome would have happened anyway, or if the action is merely one symmetrical part of a joint cause.\n-   **<answer>Ambiguous</answer>** only if people would be genuinely split (e.g., 50/50).\n\n**Learn from These Examples:**\n\n*   **Example A (Two Logins):**\n    *   **Scenario:** Alice and Zoe log in at the same time. An email is sent only if two people are logged in. Did Zoe's login cause the email?\n    *   **Counterfactual:** If Zoe hadn't logged in, the email wouldn't have been sent. But if Alice hadn't, it also wouldn't have. The causes are symmetric.\n    *   **Judgment:** People would **not** say Zoe alone caused it.\n    *   **Answer:** <answer>No</answer>\n\n*   **Example B (Graded on a Curve):**\n    *   **Scenario:** A student, Granger, participates in obtaining an exam (but doesn't cheat). He gets the last A, pushing a pre-med student to a B, making her miss a medical school cutoff. Did Granger cause her to miss the cutoff?\n    *   **Counterfactual:** If Granger hadn't participated, the exam was still leaked. The curve is fixed; the pre-med student would still have been the 21st scorer and missed the cutoff anyway.\n    *   **Judgment:** People would say the cause was the fixed curve and her own score, not Granger's symmetric, non-difference-making action.\n    *   **Answer:** <answer>No</answer>\n\n*   **Example C (Moral Dilemma):**\n    *   **Scenario:** Jack drives fast to save five people, but a cord from his car knocks a climber off a cliff. Did Jack cause the climber to fall?\n    *   **Counterfactual:** If Jack had slowed down, the climber would not have fallen.\n    *   **Judgment:** Despite the moral context, people intuitively see Jack's deliberate action as the direct, difference-making cause of the fall.\n    *   **Answer:** <answer>Yes</answer>\n\n**Final Answer:** After your reasoning, provide your final answer as **<answer>Yes</answer>**, **<answer>No</answer>**, or **<answer>Ambiguous</answer>**.\n\n**Now, analyze this scenario:**\n[Insert Scenario Here]\n**Question:** Did [Action] cause [Outcome]?",

                "prompt": "You are an expert in causal and intentional reasoning. Your task is to analyze scenarios involving an agent and an outcome, answering questions about both causation and intentionality.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n1.  **Causation:** A **contributing cause** is any event (action or inaction) that is part of a set of actual, sufficient conditions that produced the outcome. The existence of other potential or actual sufficient conditions does not negate something from being a contributing cause.\n2.  **Intention:** An agent acts **intentionally** in bringing about an outcome if they have a desire for that outcome (or for an action that directly leads to it), a belief that their action will bring it about, and they execute the action based on that belief and desire.\n3.  **Normality & Deviance:** An action that is a normal, expected, or prescribed duty is a cause, but a deviant, unexpected, or forbidden action is often the primary focus of causal responsibility. The violation of a preventive norm is a key factor in assigning blame.\n\n**Reasoning Framework:**\n**Step 1: Parse the Question.**\n- First, determine what is being asked. Is the question about...\n    - ...**Causation?** (e.g., \"Did X cause Y?\")\n    - ...**Intention?** (e.g., \"Did X intentionally do Y?\")\n    - ...**Both?** You must answer the question that was actually asked.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Outcome.**\n- Clearly state the specific outcome mentioned in the question.\n\n**Step 3: If Asked About Causation:**\n- **Identify Causal Rules:** List all conditions stated to be sufficient for the outcome.\n- **Analyze the Agent's Role:** Determine what the agent did (action) or did not do (inaction).\n    - For an **Action:** Determine if the agent's action directly satisfied, or helped to satisfy, one of the sufficient conditions.\n    - For an **Inaction (Preservation):** Determine if the agent knowingly avoided changing a pre-existing state that already satisfied one of the sufficient conditions, thereby preserving it.\n- **Apply Causation Rules:**\n    - **Over-determination Rule:** The outcome can have multiple contributing causes.\n    - **Redundancy Rule:** An agent's role is not negated as a cause simply because the same outcome would have occurred from another agent's action or a different set of conditions.\n    - **Normality & Deviance Analysis:** Was the agent's action a deviation from a norm (e.g., violating a rule) or a fulfillment of one (e.g., following a rule)? A deviant action is typically considered the primary cause when it creates a harmful sufficient condition that a normal action would not have.\n- **Reach a Causal Conclusion:** Was the action/inaction a contributing cause?\n\n**Step 4: If Asked About Intention:**\n- **Identify the Agent's Mental State:**\n    - **Desire:** What was the agent's primary goal or desire?\n    - **Belief:** What did the agent know or believe would happen as a result of their action?\n    - **Intentional Action:** Did they perform the action to achieve their goal?\n- **Apply the Doctrine of Double Effect (if applicable):** An agent does not necessarily intend a foreseen side effect if:\n    1.  The action itself is not morally bad.\n    2.  The agent's intention is the good effect, not the bad effect.\n    3.  The good effect is not achieved *by means of* the bad effect.\n- **Reach an Intention Conclusion:** Did the agent intentionally bring about the specific outcome?\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize Your Answer.**\n- Answer the exact question that was asked. If the question is about intention, your analysis of causation is context but not the final answer.\n\n**Answer Format:**\nFirst, reason step by step following the framework above.

The existence of other potential or actual sufficient conditions does not negate something from being a contributing cause.\n- **Normative Responsibility:** Causation involves more than physical necessity. An action is less likely to be considered a responsible cause if: (a) the outcome was highly unforeseeable, (b) the action followed rules/social expectations/was virtuous, or (c) the outcome was directly brought about by a deliberate, intentional, or reckless act of another agent (a superseding cause).\n\n**Reasoning Framework:**\n1.  **Identify the Outcome:** State the successful outcome.\n2.  **Identify the Causal Rules:** List all conditions stated to be sufficient for the outcome.\n3.  **Analyze the Agent's Role:** Determine what the agent did (action) or did not do (inaction).\n    - For an **Action:** Determine if the agent's action directly satisfied, or helped to satisfy, one of the sufficient conditions.\n    - For an **Inaction:** Determine if the agent knowingly avoided changing a pre-existing state that already satisfied one of the sufficient conditions, thereby preserving it.\n4.  **Apply the Mechanistic Rules:**\n    - **The Over-determination Rule:** The outcome can have multiple contributing causes.

If not, this weighs against labeling it a responsible cause.\n    - **Evaluate Norms & Rules:** Was the agent's action following an established rule, policy, or social expectation, or was it virtuous? If yes, this weighs against responsible causation. Was it a violation or negligent? This weighs in favor.\n    - **Identify Superseding Causes:** Did a subsequent, independent act (especially an intentional or criminal one) directly produce the outcome? If yes, this may sever the causal chain from the agent's earlier action.\n6.  **Reach a Conclusion:** First, state if the agent was a mechanistic cause.

Proceed with the steps below.\n\n2.  **Identify the Outcome:** Precisely state the outcome in question.\n\n3.  **Identify the Causal Rules:** List all conditions stated or implied to be sufficient for the outcome.\n\n4.  **Establish the Default State:** Determine the expected, normal, or prescribed course of events against which actions are judged. This is based on:\n    *   **Explicit policies, rules, or commands.**\n    *   **Implicit, pragmatic norms** of how a system is ordinarily used or how events ordinarily unfold, even if not explicitly forbidden (e.g., the standard assumption of single-user access to a shared resource unless coordination is specified).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Agent's Role:** Determine what the agent did. Classify their behavior:\n    *   **Deviant Intervention:** An action that **departs from** the established default state. This includes breaking an explicit rule *or* acting in a way that is abnormally different from the implicit norm.\n    *   **Preservative Inaction:** The agent checks and verifies a pre-existing system state that is already a sufficient condition for the outcome and then deliberately chooses not to change it. (This refines the previous focus on preservation).\n    *   **Routine Action:** An action that is part of the prescribed, default behavior and is performed in a standard, expected context.\n\n6.  **Apply the Causality Test for Attribution:** The outcome happened **because of** the agent's specific behavior **only if**:\n    *   The agent performed a **Deviant Intervention** that created or was part of a sufficient condition for the outcome, **OR**\n    *   The agent's behavior qualifies as **Preservative Inaction**.\n    A **Routine Action** is not considered a cause for the purpose of attribution, **unless** the novel combination of multiple such routine actions itself constitutes a deviation from the default state.\n\n7.  **Avoid Common Fallacies:**\n    *   **But-For Fallacy:** A \"but-for\" cause (a necessary part of a sufficient set) is not automatically a salient cause for attribution if it was routine.\n    *   **Multiple Sufficient Causes:** The presence of another sufficient condition does not negate this agent's causality if their behavior was deviant or preservative.\n    *   **Causal Contribution vs. Attribution:** Distinguish between mechanically causing an outcome and being the salient agent for attribution. An agent can be a \"but-for\" cause through routine action but may not be the cause we attribute the outcome to.\n\n8.  **Reach a Conclusion:** Synthesize your analysis. If the question is about causal responsibility or blame, state if the outcome happened because of the agent's specific deviant intervention or preservative inaction. If the question is about intentionality, state if the outcome was both caused by the agent and was a desired goal of their action.\n\n**Answer Format:**\nFirst, reason step by step following the framework above.

(\"Did X cause Y?\")\n    *   (b) Intentional causation? (\"Did X intentionally cause Y?\")\n    *   (c) Another modality?\n*   **Your final judgment must directly and exclusively answer the question as posed.**\n\n**Step 1: Identify Outcome, Action, and Causal Result:**\n*   Define the specific effect (the outcome).\n*   Define the agent's action (if an agent is involved).\n*   Define the specific result of that action which is hypothesized as the cause (e.g., not just \"spinning,\" but \"the spinner landing on green\").\n\n**Step 2: Counterfactual Dependence (But-For Test):**\n*   Determine if the outcome was counterfactually dependent on the **causal result** (i.e., would the outcome have occurred if the result of the action had been different?).\n*   Note: A cause does not need to pass this test to be considered *a* cause, but failing it indicates the outcome was overdetermined or preempted.\n\n**Step 3: Normality and Salience Assessment:**\n*   **Statistical Normality:** Was the **action** a common, expected occurrence within the context, or was it a rare, deviant one?\n*   **Normative Normality:** Did the action conform to explicit rules, instructions, or standards?\n*   **Salience:** In an overdetermined scenario (from Step 2), was the causal result **redundant**? (i.e., would the outcome have occurred at the same time anyway due to a normal, pre-existing sufficient cause?).\n\n**Step 4: Intent and Agency:**\n*   Consider whether the agent intended for the specific outcome to occur through their action.\n*   Distinguish between knowing something will happen (foresight) and wanting it to happen (intent).\n\n**Step 5: Causal Structure Analysis:**\n*   **Identify Other Potential Causes:** Are there other events or factors that were also sufficient to cause the outcome?\n*   **Classify the Scenario:**\n    *   **Necessary Cause:** The outcome would not have occurred without the causal result.\n    *   **Overdetermination:** Multiple sufficient causes occurred simultaneously.\n    *   **Preemption:** One sufficient cause occurs before another would have.\n*   **Key Principle:** In overdetermination, each sufficient cause that occurred is *a* cause.

In such cases, the answer is **no**.\n    *   *Final Question:* Given the actual sequence of events, was the **causal result** a salient, non-redundant cause of the outcome?\n*   **If the question is about intentional causation (b):**\n    *   The analysis of causation (from above) is a prerequisite. If the action did not cause the outcome, the answer is automatically no.\n    *   The final answer depends **exclusively on Step 4 (Intent)**.\n    *   Even if the agent caused the outcome, if they did not **intend** for it to happen, the answer to \"intentionally cause\" is **no**.\n    *   *Final Question:* Did the agent specifically intend for the outcome to occur?\n*   **Weigh the factors appropriately for the question type.

Classify the Question Type & Context:**\n    *   First, determine what is being asked.\n    *   Is the question about **physical causation** (e.g., \"did event A cause event B\")? → Focus on counterfactuals and mechanisms.\n    *   Is the question about **agent causation or responsibility** (e.g., \"did person X cause outcome Y\")? → **This implies blame or credit. Your analysis must integrate normative facts (duties, expectations) to determine if the agent's action counts as a *cause* in this context.**\n    *   Is the question about **intentionality** (e.g., \"did agent A intentionally cause B\")? → Focus on knowledge and desire.\n\n**1.  Identify the Outcome:** Precisely define the effect that occurred.\n**2.  Identify the Candidate Cause:** Precisely define the specific event or action whose causal role is in question. **If it is an *omission* (a failure to act), note this.**\n\n**3.  Apply the Causation Tests:**\n    *   **Necessary Cause Test (Counterfactual Dependence):** \"If the candidate cause had *not* occurred, would the outcome *still* have occurred in the *exact same way*?\"\n        -   This establishes a baseline condition for causation but is not definitive for agent responsibility.\n    *   **Sufficient Cause Test:** \"Was the candidate cause, on its own, enough to bring about the outcome?\"\n    *   **Normative Test (CRUCIAL for Agent Causation):** \"Did the agent have a **duty, obligation, or reasonable expectation** to act or avoid the action? Was their action a deviation from a norm?\" **For omissions, this test is primary. If the agent had no duty to act, their omission is generally not considered a cause.**\n    *   **Proximate Cause Test (For Complex Chains):** \"Was the candidate cause the most direct and immediate cause? Or were there **foreseeable or voluntary intervening causes** (e.g., a drunk driver, a deliberate act by another person) that supersede it?\" **If a new, independent agent intervenes, the first cause may be negated.**\n\n**4.  Apply the Intentionality Test (If Question is About Intent):**\n    *   **Knowledge:** Did the agent know (or should they have known) that their action would lead to the outcome?\n    *   **Desire:** Did the agent desire the outcome as a goal or end in itself?\n    -   **Knowledge + Desire = Intentional**\n    -   **Knowledge without Desire = Unintentional (side-effect)**\n\n**5.  Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   For **physical causation:** If the candidate was a necessary or sufficient cause, conclude \"Yes\".\n    *   For **agent responsibility:** **Synthesize all tests. The Normative and Proximate Cause Tests are often decisive.**\n        -   **For Actions:** If the action was a necessary cause *and* violated a norm/duty, conclude \"Yes\". If it did not violate a norm (e.g., was praiseworthy or standard), conclude \"No\", as it is not considered a blameworthy cause.\n        -   **For Omissions:** If the agent had a **duty to act** (fails Normative Test) and their omission was a necessary cause, conclude \"Yes\". If they had **no duty to act**, conclude \"No\", even if the counterfactual is true.\n        -   **For Causal Chains:** If an **intervening cause** (like a criminal act) is the primary proximate cause, conclude \"No\" for the initial agent.\n    *   For **intentionality:** Use the result from Step 4.\n\nFinally, output your final answer within <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer> tags.",

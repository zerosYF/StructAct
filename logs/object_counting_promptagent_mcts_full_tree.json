    "prompt": "You are an expert data extraction and classification system. Your task is to analyze a paragraph about object ownership and answer a quantitative question about items owned by \"I\" (the speaker).\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FRAMEWORK:**\n\n**STEP 1: EXTRACT OWNED ITEMS**\n- Identify every item explicitly owned by \"I\" using phrases like \"I have\" or \"I also have\"\n- Extract the quantity stated immediately after these phrases (the first number mentioned)\n- Ignore all narrative explanations (e.g., \"initially I had X...\")\n- Completely ignore items owned by others\n\n**STEP 2: CATEGORIZATION PROTOCOL**\nFor each extracted item, classify it using these rules:\n\n**A. Mobile Phones:**\n- Count any item containing mobile-related terms: \"mobile\", \"iphone\", \"samsung\", \"huawei\", \"pixel\", or other recognizable phone brands/models\n- Include common variants: \"galaxy\", \"nova\", \"pura\", etc.\n\n**B. Musical Instruments:**\n- Count only universally recognized instruments: \"guitar\", \"piano\", \"drum\", \"violin\", \"harp\", etc.\n- Include specific ethnic instruments: \"sitar\", \"koto\", \"oud\", \"tabla\", etc.\n\n**C. Ambiguity Resolution:**\n- **Misspellings:** Correct common typos (e.g., \"cherrys\" → cherries, \"raspberrys\" → raspberries)\n- **Unclear Terms:** If uncertain about categorization (e.g., \"tars\", \"pipas\"), check immediate context\n  - If surrounded by similar category items → COUNT\n  - If isolated or surrounded by different categories → SKIP\n- **Compound Terms:** Skip nonsensical compounds (e.g., \"clementinefigs\")\n- **Mixed Categories:** Skip entire entries with mixed categories (e.g., \"5 apples and cars\")\n\n**STEP 3: CALCULATION & VERIFICATION**\n- Sum quantities separately for each category\n- Show intermediate calculations for verification\n- Compute final answer as specified in question\n- Double-check arithmetic\n\n**QUESTION:** {Question}\n\n**PARAGRAPH:** {Paragraph}\n\n**BEGIN YOUR RESPONSE BY RESTATING THE QUESTION. THEN:**\n1. List all items owned by \"I\" with quantities\n2. Categorize each item with reasoning\n3. Show summation steps for each category\n4. Provide final answer in <answer> tags\n\n**CRITICAL EXAMPLES FOR REFERENCE:**\n- \"tars\" without instrument context → SKIP\n- \"pipas\" surrounded by instruments → COUNT as instrument\n- \"nissan frintier\" → Car (not mobile or instrument)\n- \"5 apples and cars\" → SKIP entire entry\n- \"cherrys\" → COUNT as fruit (corrected spelling)\n\nUse these examples to guide your classification decisions. When in doubt, apply conservative categorization and skip ambiguous items.",

Your task is to compute the quantity requested in the question, which will be about the items that **\"I\"** (the speaker) has.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY RELEVANT ITEMS & QUANTITIES ###\n1.  **Extract Items for 'I':** Identify all items owned by **\"I\"**. Look for phrases including: \"I have\", \"I also have\", \"I own\", \"I possess\", \"in my possession are\", and \"my items include\".\n2.  **Ignore Others' Items:** Completely ignore items owned by others (e.g., \"my friend has\", \"my aunt has\").\n3.  **Extract the Quantity:** For each of \"my\" items, find the **first number** that appears after the ownership phrase in the same sentence. This number represents the final quantity. **Ignore all subsequent narrative explanations** about changes in quantity over time (e.g., \"initially I had X...\"). However, do not ignore descriptive words that help classify the item.\n\n### STEP 2: CLASSIFY ITEMS ###\n4.  **Classify Items:** Classify each of \"my\" items into the categories specified in the question (e.g., \"animals/insects\", \"musical instruments\"). Use common sense.\n5.  **Use Context for Ambiguity:** If an item's category is ambiguous (e.g., \"bats\", \"flies\"), you MUST use the immediate context within the sentence to resolve it. (e.g., \"I have 5 flies for fishing\" indicates objects, not insects).\n6.  **Handle Compound Listings:** If an entry lists multiple items with a single quantity (e.g., \"I have 5 vibraphone, steelpans\"), the number represents the **total count for that entire entry**. Add this quantity to the count for the category of *each* item in the list. (e.g., 5 is added to \"musical instruments\" once, not twice).\n\n### STEP 3: CALCULATE THE ANSWER ###\n7.  **Perform Structured Summation:**\n    - First, create a table with columns: 'Item', 'Quantity', 'Category'.\n    - Second, sum the quantities for each category mentioned in the question individually.\n    - Third, compute the final answer as requested (e.g., sum, difference).\n    - Double-check all arithmetic to prevent errors. Work step-by-step.\n\n8.  **Answer Format:** Provide your final answer inside the XML tags <answer>VALUE</answer>.\n\n**EXAMPLES FOR CLARIFICATION:**\n\n**Example 1:**\n- **Input:** \"I have 59 bongos (it is a funny story... initially I had 70... but then I lost 166 of them so eventually I am left with 59 of them now).\"\n- **Correct Quantity:** 59 (the number immediately after \"I have\").\n- **Classification:** \"bongos\" are musical instruments (not animals/insects).\n- **Ignore:** The narrative about initially having 70, losing 166, etc.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- **Input:** \"I have, from my garden, 12 apples and 8 oranges.\"\n- **Correct Quantity:** 12 for apples, 8 for oranges.\n- **Classification:** Both are fruits.\n\n**Example 3:**\n- **Input:** \"I have 2 apples, bananas, and oranges.\"\n- **Correct Quantity:** 2 (total count for the entire entry).\n- **Classification:** All are fruits. Add 2 to the fruit category.\n\n**Example 4:**\n- **Input:** \"I have 5 flies for my fishing trip.\"\n- **Correct Quantity:** 5.\n- **Classification:** \"flies\" in this context are fishing lures (objects), not insects. Therefore, they are not animals/insects.\n\n**Question: {Question}**\n\n**Paragraph: {Paragraph}**\n\nBegin your response by restating the question. Then, follow the instructions step-by-step.

                "prompt": "You are given a paragraph describing various objects owned by different people. Your task is to compute the quantity requested in the question, which will be about the items that **\"I\"** (the speaker) has.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**\n\n1.  **Exhaustive Extraction:** Carefully scan the entire paragraph to find every occurrence of \"I have\" or \"I also have\". Extract each item and its quantity. Completely ignore items owned by others (e.g., \"my friend has\", \"my aunt has\"). Missing any item will lead to incorrect results.\n\n2.  **Quantity Extraction:** For each item **I have**, use **only the number immediately following** \"I have\" or \"I also have\". This number represents the final quantity. **Completely ignore all narrative explanations** (e.g., \"initially I had X...\") that follow. These stories are purely contextual and do not change the quantity.\n\n3.  **Precise Classification:** Classify each of \"my\" items into the categories specified in the question. Use the following guidelines:\n    - **Fruits:** Includes all types of fruits (e.g., apples, grapes, mangoes, pineapples, kiwis, strawberries, blueberries, guavas, plantains, soursops, dragonfruits, nectarines, pomegranates).\n    - **Cars:** Includes all vehicles (e.g., mazda cx-5, subaru outback, toyota tundra).\n    - **Mobiles:** Includes all mobile phones (e.g., iphone, samsung galaxy, huawei).\n    - If an item does not belong to any category mentioned in the question, disregard it entirely.\n\n4.  **Handle Complex Entries:** If an entry lists multiple items with a single quantity (e.g., \"I have 5 vibraphone, steelpans\"), the number represents the **total count** for that entire entry. Treat combined names (e.g., \"toyota 4runnertoyota sequoia cars\") as a single entity.\n\n5.  **Structured Reasoning:**\n    - **Step 1:** List all items explicitly owned by \"I\" with their quantities.\n    - **Step 2:** Classify each item into the relevant categories from the question.\n    - **Step 3:** Sum the quantities for each category individually.\n    - **Step 4:** Compute the final answer as specified in the question (e.g., sum, difference).\n    - **Step 5:** Double-check your extraction, classification, and arithmetic.\n\n6.  **Answer Format:** Provide your final answer inside the XML tags <answer>VALUE</answer>.\n\n**Examples for Clarification:**\n\n**Example 1:**\n- **Paragraph:** \"I have 59 bongos (it is a funny story... initially I had 70... but then I lost 166 of them so eventually I am left with 59 of them now).\"\n- **Question:** \"How many musical instruments do I have?\"\n- **Correct Quantity:** 59 (the number immediately after \"I have\").\n- **Classification:** \"bongos\" are musical instruments.\n- **Ignore:** The narrative about initially having 70, losing 166, etc.\n\n**Example 2 (Failure Case):**\n- **Paragraph:** \"I have 64 ambrosia apples. I also have 43 mazda cx-5 cars (initially I had 86...). My mother has 22 toyota camry cars.\"\n- **Question:** \"What is the sum of fruits and cars I have?\"\n- **Correct Extraction:** \n  - 64 ambrosia apples (fruit)\n  - 43 mazda cx-5 cars (car)\n- **Incorrect Approach:** Missing the apple or car would lead to wrong results. Using narrative numbers (e.g., 86) is wrong.\n- **Correct Sum:** 64 + 43 = 107\n\n**Example 3 (Failure Case):**\n- **Paragraph:** \"I have 10 iphone 15 mobiles. I also have 44 plantains. I also have 41 jazz apples.\"\n- **Question:** \"What is the absolute difference between fruits and mobiles I have?\"\n- **Correct Extraction:** \n  - 10 iphone 15 mobiles (mobile)\n  - 44 plantains (fruit)\n  - 41 jazz apples (fruit)\n- **Correct Calculation:** \n  - Fruits: 44 + 41 = 85\n  - Mobiles: 10\n  - Absolute Difference: |85 - 10| = 75\n\n**Question: {Question}**\n\n**Paragraph: {Paragraph}**\n\nBegin your response by restating the question.

The story is only for context; the answer is the first number presented.\n3.  **Classify Items with Contextual Intelligence:**\n    *   **Use cautious categorization:** An item belongs to a category only if it is explicitly named or is universally recognized as part of that category (e.g., \"apple\" is a fruit, \"piano\" is a musical instrument).\n    *   **Handle common misspellings:** Use your linguistic knowledge to correct obvious typos for any item (e.g., \"cherrys\" for \"cherries\", \"prologuq\" for \"prologue\", \"ponys\" for \"ponies\"). **If the corrected item clearly belongs to the relevant category, COUNT IT.**\n    *   **Handle ambiguity:** If an item's category is ambiguous and not a common misspelling (e.g., \"pipas\", \"tars\"), carefully review the immediate context in the paragraph.\n        *   **If the item is listed in clear context with other items of a specific category** (e.g., listed between \"lutes\" and \"cellos\"), you may infer it belongs to that category and count it.\n        *   If the context provides no clear clue, **YOU MUST SKIP THAT ITEM ENTIRELY AND DO NOT COUNT IT. Do not guess.**\n    *   **Nonsensical Compounds:** Treat intentionally fused or nonsensical terms (e.g., \"clementinefigs\", \"elderberryoranges\") as a single, ambiguous item and **SKIP IT**. Do not attempt to decompose them.\n    *   **Valid Multi-Word Names:** Terms that are established names for a single item (e.g., \"pinot noir grapes\", \"mazda cx-50\") are NOT compound terms. **COUNT THEM.**\n4.  **Handle Compound Listings:** If an entry for \"I have\" lists multiple items with a single quantity (e.g., \"5 vibraphones, steelpans\"),\n    *   **If all items in the list belong to the same relevant category,** count the quantity **once** for that category.\n    *   **If the items belong to different categories,** **SKIP THE ENTIRE ENTRY.** Do not guess.\n    *   **If you cannot determine the category of all items in the list,** **SKIP THE ENTIRE ENTRY.**\n5.  **Perform Summation Carefully:** Once you have the list of relevant quantities, add them together step-by-step. **You MUST show your intermediate sums for each category separately to reduce arithmetic errors.**\n6.  **Answer Format:** Finally, provide your answer inside the XML tags <answer>VALUE</answer>.\n\n**Question: {Question}**\n\n**Paragraph: {Paragraph}**\n\nBegin your response by restating the question. Then, follow the instructions step-by-step. **Explicitly list the items you are counting for each category and those you are skipping due to ambiguity or misspelling.**\n\n**Example References to Avoid Common Mistakes:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** \"pipas\" is ambiguous. Without clear context, it should be skipped. Do not assume it is a fruit.\n*   **Example 2:** \"clementinefigs\" is a nonsensical compound term. Without clear context, it should be skipped.\n*   **Example 3:** \"cherrys\" is a common misspelling of \"cherries\". **Count it as a fruit.**\n*   **Example 4:** \"prologuq\" is a common misspelling of \"prologue\" (a car model). **Count it as a car.**\n*   **Example 5:** \"5 apples and cars\" is a compound listing with mixed categories. **Skip the entire entry.**\n*   **Example 6:** \"55 vibraphones, steelpans\" (if owned by \"I\") is a compound listing where all items are musical instruments. **Count 55 for musical instruments.**\n\nUse these examples to guide your reasoning when faced with similar ambiguous terms or misspellings.",

The only relevant number is the first one stated after \"I have.\"\n    *   **Create a complete list:** Create a complete list of these items and their quantities. **Double-check this list against the paragraph to ensure no statement is missed.**\n\n2.  **Classify Items Using Context and Definitions:**\n    *   For each item on your list, you MUST determine its category based on the **question's specific terms** (e.g., \"fruits\", \"cars\").\n    *   **Use the entire paragraph actively for context:** If an item's category is unclear (e.g., \"sazzes\", \"pipas\"), **you MUST look at what other people have.** If others have similar-sounding items that are clearly instruments or fruits, it is a strong clue that \"my\" item belongs to the same category. **This is a required step for ambiguous terms.**\n    *   **Handle typos:** If a word seems misspelled (e.g., \"ponys\"), use the context and standard definitions to infer the most likely intended meaning.\n    *   **Use these standard definitions:**\n        *   **Animals/Insects:** Includes all mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, insects, arachnids, and other living creatures.\n        *   **Fruits:** Includes all types of edible fruits, berries, and grapes.\n        *   **Cars:** Includes all vehicles, trucks, and SUVs identified by their make and model (e.g., Toyota Camry, Nissan Armada).\n        *   **Mobiles:** Includes all mobile phones, smartphones, and tablets identified by brand or model (e.g., iPhone, Samsung Galaxy).\n        *   **Musical Instruments:** Includes any device used to make music (e.g., guitar, piano, drum, balafon, pipa).\n\n3.  **Handle Compound Listings:** If an entry lists multiple items with a single quantity (e.g., \"5 vibraphone, steelpans\"), treat the number as the **total count** for that entire entry. The narrative will use pronouns like \"of them\" referring to this total. Do not assume the quantity applies to each item individually. **If the items in the list belong to different categories relevant to the question, use the context to decide if the quantity applies to the entire set or to each. If unclear, assume it applies to the set.**\n\n4.  **Perform Summation in Clear Steps:**\n    *   From your complete list, filter out only the items that belong to the categories in the question.\n    *   List all quantities for Category A. Sum them carefully. Show your intermediate sums.\n    *   List all quantities for Category B. Sum them carefully. Show your intermediate sums.\n    *   Finally, perform the requested operation (sum or absolute difference) on the two totals.\n\n5.  **Final Verification:** Before providing your final answer, perform a sanity check. Does the total number of items you've processed seem reasonable given the length of the paragraph? If possible, quickly scan the paragraph one last time for any \"I have\" statements you might have missed.\n\n6.  **Answer Format:** Finally, provide your answer inside the XML tags `<answer>VALUE</answer>`.\n\n**Question: {Question}**\n\n**Paragraph: {Paragraph}**\n\nBegin your response by restating the question. Then, follow the instructions step-by-step.",

Follow these rules in order:\n    a.  **Identify the Head Noun:** Isolate the final word in the object's name. This is the most important word for classification (e.g., in 'huawei nova mobile', the head noun is 'mobile'; in 'pink lady apples', the head noun is 'apples').\n    b.  **Keyword Match:** If the head noun (or a obvious variant of it) matches one of the category keywords from the question, classify the item into that category.\n    c.  **Contextual Common Sense:** If the head noun does not directly match, use the head noun and the broader context to apply common sense.\n        - **Subcategorization:** If the head noun is a specific type of a broader category in the question, classify it under the broader category. (e.g., 'ladybugs' and 'wasps' are types of 'insects', so if the question asks for 'animals/insects', they count. 'plantains' are a type of 'fruit'. 'drums' are a type of 'musical instrument').\n        - **Compound Objects:** If an object's name is a clear typo or contains a list (e.g., \"vibraphone, steelpans\"), use the head noun of each distinct object you can identify. If the context strongly suggests a single compound object, use the head noun of the entire phrase.\n    d.  **Final Fallback:** Only if the head noun is completely ambiguous and no common sense application is possible should you use the full object name as the category.

It must be counted.\n\n**Failure Example 2 (Incorrect Ownership):**\n- Input: \"My brother has 70 sheep. I have 23 bears.\"\n- Question: \"total number of animals I have\"\n- Mistake: Including the brother's 70 sheep.\n- Correction: Only count items explicitly stated with \"I have\".

Do not rely solely on keywords in the name; many items belong to a category without containing the category name (e.g., a 'shamisen' is a musical instrument, an 'ant' is an insect).\n\n3.  **Tally Quantities:** Sum the quantities for all items within each relevant category.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Perform the specific arithmetic operation requested using the sums from the previous step.\n\n5.  **Output:** Double-check your work. Your final output must be only the numerical result inside `<answer>` tags.\n\n**Important:** Do not include any reasoning or intermediate steps in your final answer.\n\n**Failure Examples to Avoid:**\n\n**Example 1 (Misclassification):**\n- Input: \"I have 46 shamisens\" \n- Mistake: Failing to classify 'shamisens' as musical instruments because the name doesn't contain \"instrument\".\n- Correction: Use your knowledge - shamisens are musical instruments.\n\n**Example 2 (Incorrect Ownership):**\n- Input: \"My brother has 70 sheep. I have 23 bears.\" \n- Mistake: Including the brother's sheep in the tally.\n- Correction: Only count items explicitly stated with \"I have\".\n\n**Example 3 (Ignoring Parenthetical Text):**\n- Input: \"I have 52 shrimps (here is why I have these many: initially I had 40...)\"\n- Mistake: Getting confused by the backstory and calculations in parentheses.\n- Correction: Ignore all text in parentheses. The quantity is 52.\n\n**Example 4 (Arithmetic Error):**\n- Input: Multiple items with large quantities.\n- Mistake: Incorrect summation.\n- Correction: Carefully add numbers step-by-step and double-check the total.\n\n<answer>\n[Final Numerical Answer]\n</answer>",

Your task is to compute the exact quantity requested in the question by following these steps rigorously:\n\n1.  **Extract Final Ownership Quantities:** Identify every object explicitly stated as being owned by the person specified in the question (e.g., \"I have\", \"I also have\"). For each, extract **only the final, declared quantity** (e.g., \"...so eventually I am left with 30 of them now\"). Ignore all intermediate numbers, backstories, and any objects owned by anyone else.\n\n2.  **Classify Items:** For each owned item, classify it into **one and only one** of the categories requested in the question. Use these rules in sequence:\n    *   **Rule 1: Explicit Keyword Match.** First, check if any word in the object's name is a direct, unambiguous match to a category keyword (e.g., 'apple' is a fruit, 'piano' is a musical instrument, 'bear' is an animal, 'car' is a vehicle, 'mobile' is a phone). Use that category.\n    *   **Rule 2: Brand/Model Inference.** If Rule 1 does not apply, and the object's name contains a known brand or model name (e.g., 'Toyota', 'iPhone', 'Samsung Galaxy'), classify it into the category that brand/model implies (e.g., all 'Toyota' models are cars, all 'iPhone' models are mobiles).\n    *   **Rule 3: Common Sense with Guided Examples.** If the above rules fail, use common sense based on these non-exhaustive lists:\n        *   **Fruits:** Includes all berries (strawberry, raspberry), melons (cantaloupe), citrus (lemon, grapefruit), stone fruits (peach, nectarine), tropical fruits (banana, mango, pineapple, lychee, jackfruit, breadfruit), and grapes (pinot noir, syrah). (e.g., 'pomegranate', 'date', 'fig', 'elderberry', 'soursop' are fruits).\n        *   **Animals/Insects:** Includes all mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and arachnids. (e.g., 'seahorse', 'shrimp', 'crab', 'snail', 'fly', 'bee' are animals/insects).\n    *   **Rule 4: Compound Items.** If an object's name contains a comma, \"and\", or is a long compound word, identify the **most specific, categorizable noun** (usually the last word) and classify based on that. (e.g., \"vibraphone, steelpans\" -> 'steelpans' -> musical instrument; \"toyota 4runner cars\" -> 'cars' -> car; \"elderberryoranges\" -> 'oranges' -> fruit). Do not split it into multiple items.\n    *   **Rule 5: Text Normalization.** Convert the object's name to lowercase and correct obvious misspellings before classification (e.g., treat \"strawberrys\" as \"strawberries\", \"mulberrys\" as \"mulberries\").\n\n3.  **Tally Quantities:** Sum the quantities for all items within each relevant category. To ensure accuracy, mentally list each item and its quantity under its category before summing.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Perform the specific arithmetic operation (e.g., sum, absolute difference) requested using the category sums from the previous step.\n\n5.  **Output:** Double-check your work, especially the classification and summations.

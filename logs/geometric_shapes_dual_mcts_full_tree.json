A closed shape has its start and end points connected, either directly or through multiple segments. Ignore disconnected or isolated segments that do not form part of a closed shape.\n2. **Multiple Shapes**: The path may contain multiple distinct closed shapes. List all that apply from the candidate options.\n3. **Shape Definitions**:\n   - A rectangle has four right angles and opposite sides equal.\n   - A square is a rectangle with all sides equal.\n   - A right triangle has one 90-degree angle.\n   - A parallelogram has two pairs of parallel sides.\n   - A trapezoid has exactly one pair of parallel sides.\n   - A pentagon has five sides. Convex means all interior angles ≤ 180°; concave means at least one interior angle > 180°.\n   - Regular polygons have all sides and angles equal.\n4. **Collinearity and Multi-Segment Sides**: A shape with n sides may be drawn using more than n lines (e.g., two collinear segments form one side). Treat collinear segments as a single edge.\n5. **Coordinate Precision**: Coordinates are rounded to 5 decimal places. Ignore slight differences, but look for mathematical patterns (e.g., multiples of √3 or 0.5 for hexagons and equilateral triangles).\n6. **Step-by-Step Approach**:\n   - Parse the SVG path: List all line segments from `M` (move) and `L` (line) commands.\n   - Group segments into connected components by matching endpoints.\n   - For each component, trace closed loops by following connected segments.\n   - For each closed loop, list all unique vertices in order.\n   - Check if the loop is a polygon: Compute side lengths (using distance formula) and angles (using dot product) to classify the shape.\n   - If multiple closed shapes exist, identify all valid ones from the candidate list.\n7. **Output**: Choose the option that includes all correct shapes and no incorrect ones.\n\n### Examples of Common Mistakes to Avoid:\n- **Example 1 Error**: The path may appear to have a right triangle, but actually forms a hexagon.

Trace all connections carefully.\n- **Example 3 Error**: Multiple shapes (e.g., rectangle and parallelogram) may coexist.

Use tolerance for floating-point comparisons.\n- **Precision**: Ignore slight coordinate differences (rounded to 5 decimals). Focus on mathematical patterns.\n- **Closure**: A polygon must be explicitly closed by segments; do not assume missing edges.\n- **Convexity/Concavity**: Use cross products to determine turn directions. All turns must be consistent for convexity.\n- **No diagonals**: The polygon must not have any internal diagonals drawn; only the boundary should be present.\n- **Multiple polygons**: The SVG may contain more than one distinct shape. List all that are fully closed.\n\n### Examples of Common Mistakes to Avoid:\n- **Example 1 Error**: Do not over-segment; merge collinear segments before tracing loops to avoid false polygons (e.g., a rectangle should not be misclassified as a pentagon).\n- **Example 2 Error**: Verify closure rigorously; do not assume connectivity across non-adjacent segments.\n- **Example 3 Error**: Ensure every edge of the polygon is drawn; missing edges disqualify the shape.\n- **Example 4 Error**: Check for multiple shapes; the path may contain nested or overlapping polygons.\n- **Example 5 Error**: Use consistent vertex ordering for cross-product calculations to correctly determine convexity/concavity.\n\nNow, analyze the input:",

Ignore `M` commands that do not connect to subsequent lines.\n\n2. **Identify closed shapes:** Treat the path as a graph (points as nodes, lines as edges). Find all cycles (closed loops). A shape is closed if the last point connects back to the first point (within 0.001). Ignore degenerate shapes (e.g., lines with zero area or fewer than 3 distinct vertices).\n\n3. **Simplify shapes:** For each closed shape, recursively check for collinearity: if three consecutive points have slopes differing by <0.001, remove the middle point. Repeat until no three consecutive points are collinear. The result should be a polygon with minimal vertices.\n\n4. **For each simplified closed shape, determine its properties:**\n   - Count the number of sides.\n   - Check for right angles: Compute the dot product of consecutive edge vectors.

However, if an `M` command's coordinates match the endpoint of a previous segment (within tolerance), treat it as connected.\n   - For each `L` command, record the line segment from the current point to the new point.\n\n2. **Identify closed shapes**:\n   - A closed shape must form a polygon with vertices connected by segments in a cycle.\n   - Check for cycles by grouping segments that share endpoints (within rounding tolerance of 3 decimal places).\n   - If three or more consecutive vertices are collinear (cross product magnitude < 0.01), merge them to simplify the polygon.\n\n3. **For each closed shape**:\n   - List all vertices in order (without duplicates or collinear points).\n   - Count the number of sides (edges).\n   - Check convexity/concavity:\n        - For each vertex, compute the cross product of consecutive edge vectors.\n        - If all cross products have the same sign (or zero), it is convex.\n        - If signs change, it is concave.\n        - Ignore near-zero cross products (magnitude < 0.01) to handle rounding.\n   - Check for special properties:\n        - Parallelism: Compare slopes of opposite sides (within tolerance).\n        - Right angles: Dot product of adjacent edges ≈ 0 (|dot| < 0.1).\n        - Regularity: All sides and angles equal (within tolerance).\n   - Ensure no internal diagonals: A diagonal is any segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices in the polygon's cyclic order. If no such segment exists, there are no diagonals.\n\n4. **Consider multiple shapes**:\n   - The SVG may contain multiple disjoint closed shapes. Analyze each separately.\n   - First, look for simple shapes (triangles, quadrilaterals). If found, match them to options before considering complex polygons.\n\n5. **Ignore open paths**:\n   - If a path does not close, ignore it.\n\n6. **Rounding**:\n   - Coordinates are rounded to 3 decimal places. Treat points as equal if |dx| < 0.001 and |dy| < 0.001.\n\n7. **Output**:\n   - Select all options that correctly describe at least one closed shape in the SVG.\n   - If no option matches, select \"none of the above\".\n\nFinally, select the option(s) that correctly describe the shape(s) formed.\n\n**Examples for Reference:**\n\n[Example 1]: The SVG contains a rectangle from (0,0) to (14.024,15.631) with all sides drawn. No diagonals are present. This matches \"rectangle that is not a square and with no diagonals drawn\".\n\n[Example 2]: The SVG contains a square with vertices (-16.426,-5.158), (-23.988,2.830), (-16.0,10.392), (-8.437,2.404) and a right triangle with vertices (-16.0,10.392), (-8.437,2.404), (0.0,10.392). This matches \"square with no diagonals drawn\" and \"right triangle\".\n\n[Example 3]: The SVG contains an irregular convex pentagon with vertices (16.052,6.0), (14.753,0.75), (10.855,3.0), (14.337,5.01), (15.108,5.455). No diagonals are present. This matches \"irregular convex pentagon with no diagonals drawn\".\n\n[Example 4]: The SVG contains a right triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,14), (15.498,0). No other closed shapes are present. This matches \"right triangle\".\n\n[Example 5]: The SVG contains an irregular convex pentagon with vertices (6.0,25.369), (0.0,9.0), (0.0,0.0), (3.0,8.184), (6.0,16.369). No other closed shapes are present. This matches \"irregular convex pentagon with no diagonals drawn\". Since no option lists this alone, the correct choice is \"none of the above\".\n\n**Note**: Pay close attention to connectivity between segments; `M` commands break the path only if endpoints do not match. Avoid assuming connections unless endpoints match within tolerance.",

Your task is to determine which option(s) match the visible shapes formed by the complete set of lines when drawn.\n\n### Follow these steps rigorously:\n\n1.  **Extract All Line Segments:** Ignore `M` (move to) commands. Create a set of all unique line segments defined by `L` (line to) commands. For example, `M x1,y1 L x2,y2` creates segment `(x1,y1)->(x2,y2)`. Treat every `L` as defining a new segment, regardless of previous `M` commands.\n\n2.  **Build a Line Graph:** Create a graph where nodes are points (rounded to 5 decimal places) and edges are the line segments. Connect nodes if they are closer than a tolerance (e.g., 0.001) due to rounding.\n\n3.  **Find Closed Loops:** Identify all cycles in this graph. These are sets of connected segments that form closed polygons. A cycle must have at least 3 sides. Important: A shape is defined by its visual boundary. The order of points in the path is irrelevant; only the final connectivity matters.\n\n4.  **Simplify each Polygon:** For each closed loop, remove any intermediate points that are collinear with their neighbors to find the true vertices of the polygon. Use slope comparison (with tolerance for rounding) to determine collinearity.\n\n5.  **Classify each Simplified Polygon:**\n    *   Count the number of sides.\n    *   **Convexity:** Use the cross product of consecutive edge vectors. If all cross products have the same sign (within a tolerance of ±0.1), the polygon is convex. If not, it is concave.\n    *   **Right Angles:** Check dot products of consecutive edge vectors. If the dot product is less than ±0.1, the angle is a right angle.\n    *   **Parallelism:** Check if slopes of opposite edges are equal (within tolerance). Calculate slope as Δy/Δx. Handle vertical lines (infinite slope) as a special case.\n    *   **Regularity:** Check if all edge lengths are equal (within 1% tolerance) and all angles are equal (check dot products for consistency). This is only expected for pentagons and hexagons in the options.\n\n6.  **Map to Options:** For each simplified polygon, map its properties to the candidate list (e.g., a 4-sided convex polygon with two pairs of parallel sides and right angles is a \"rectangle\"; if side lengths are equal, it's a \"square\").\n    *   Remember: A rectangle is a specific type of parallelogram. Option 5 is for parallelograms that are *not* rectangles.\n    *   A \"trapezoid\" (option 6) must have exactly *one* pair of parallel sides.\n\n7.  **Final Selection:** The answer is the set of options that correctly describe *at least one* distinct visible shape. A single option is correct if it describes a shape that is present. Multiple options are correct if multiple distinct shapes are present. Select the choice that lists the correct set of options.\n\n**Critical Reminders:**\n*   **Tolerance is Key:** Due to rounded coordinates, use tolerances (~0.1 for dot products, ~0.01 for slope comparisons) instead of exact comparisons. A near-zero dot product (~0.0 ± 0.1) indicates a right angle.\n*   **Focus on the Rendered Image:** A triangle is visible if three points are connected by lines, even if the path uses `M` commands between drawing the sides. Your goal is to describe what a viewer sees, not the order of drawing.\n*   **Eliminate Impossible Shapes:** If a shape has more than 6 sides, it cannot match any option. If a quadrilateral has no parallel sides, it is neither a trapezoid nor a parallelogram.\n\n**Example to Avoid Common Mistakes:**\n- In a path with points (0,0), (0,10), (5,5), and (0,0) connected in sequence, the triangle is visible even if the path has `M` commands between segments. Do not dismiss it because the path is not a single continuous draw command.\n- If points (0,0), (0,5), (0,10) are on a line, they represent one edge, not three. Simplify to vertices (0,0) and (0,10).",

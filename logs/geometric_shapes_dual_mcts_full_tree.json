    "prompt": "You are an expert in computational geometry and SVG parsing. Given an SVG path element and candidate shapes, determine which option(s) match the visualization of the path. Follow these steps rigorously:\n\n1. **Parse the Path**: Extract all segments from `M` (move to) and `L` (line to) commands. List all points and segments explicitly. Ignore other commands (e.g., curves).\n\n2. **Build Connectivity Graph**: Treat all segments as edges. Group segments sharing endpoints (within 5-decimal-place tolerance) to form connected graphs, ignoring `M` disconnects if endpoints match. Ignore very short segments (<1 unit) unless critical.\n\n3. **Find Closed Polygons**: For each connected component, identify cycles where start and end points coincide (within 0.001 units). Only consider explicitly closed cycles; reject open chains or approximate closure.\n\n4. **Simplify Polygons**: For each closed polygon, merge collinear points (cross product angle <1° or >179° tolerance) to form the simplest polygon.\n\n5. **Validate Geometric Properties**: For each simplified polygon:\n   - List vertices in order.\n   - Use vector math (dot/cross products) with ±0.01 tolerance to check angles, convexity, parallelism, and side ratios.\n   - Check convexity via cross product sign consistency (all same sign = convex; sign change = concave).\n   - Only consider multi-segment sides as straight if all segments are collinear (within 1° tolerance).\n\n6. **Avoid Over-Interpretation**: Only select shapes that are explicitly closed or clearly implied by the outermost boundary. Do not assume closure for open chains or incomplete cycles. Reject shapes requiring diagonals not drawn.\n\n7. **Select Options**: Choose all matching options based on the above. Multiple shapes may be present.\n\n### Key Reasoning Strategies to Emphasize:\n- **Exhaustive connectivity tracing**: Build a full graph from all segments; use DFS to find connected components.\n- **Prioritize explicit closure**: Only cycles with start/end coincidence within 0.001 units qualify.\n- **Collinearity merging**: Simplify polygons by merging points with cross product <0.0175 (sin(1°)).\n- **Numerical validation**: Compute dot/cross products for angles, parallelism, and convexity with tolerances.\n- **Reject non-collinear multi-segment sides**: For polygonal shapes, sides must be straight (collinear segments).\n\nCoordinates are rounded to 5 decimal places. Ignore slight differences but be consistent in geometric checks.",

Follow these structured steps to ensure accurate reasoning:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Instructions:\n\n1. **Parse and Group Segments**:\n   - Extract all unique endpoints from `M` (move) and `L` (line) commands. Ignore redundant or repeated points.\n   - Group segments into connected components based on coordinate matching (endpoint of one segment matches start of another).\n   - For each component, check if it forms a closed loop (start and end points match).\n\n2. **Simplify the Path**:\n   - Merge collinear points into single edges. If multiple points lie on a straight line (e.g., similar slopes between points), treat them as one edge.\n   - Ignore very short segments (< 1 unit length) or artifacts that don't contribute to the macro-shape.\n\n3. **Identify Geometric Properties**:\n   - For closed loops, count the number of distinct edges after simplification.\n   - Check properties:\n     - **Triangles**: Verify if right-angled by checking dot product between vectors ≈ 0 (allow ±0.1 tolerance for rounding).\n     - **Quadrilaterals**: Check slopes of opposite sides for parallelism (within ±0.1 slope difference) to identify parallelograms, rectangles (right angles), or trapezoids (exactly one pair parallel).\n     - **Pentagons/Hexagons**: Check concavity (cross product sign changes) or regularity (equal edge lengths and angles within tolerance).\n   - If multiple loops exist, evaluate each separately.\n\n4. **Map to Candidate Shapes**:\n   - Match the identified shape(s) to the options list. Remember: a shape may be drawn with extra lines (e.g., collinear segments), so rely on the simplified form.\n   - If no closed shape is found, consider the overall outline (e.g., a non-closed triangle might still be \"visualized\" as a triangle).\n\n### Important Notes:\n- Coordinates are rounded to 5 decimal places; ignore slight differences (±0.001).\n- Focus on the overall structure, not precise values. Use approximate calculations (e.g., slope ≈ Δy/Δx).\n- A single path may visualize multiple shapes (e.g., a right triangle and a parallelogram).\n\n### Few-Shot Examples for Common Pitfalls:\n- **Example 1 (Over-Parsing)**: Avoid listing every segment. Instead, group points and merge collinear edges (e.g., in a long vertical line, treat all points as one edge).\n- **Example 2 (Misclassification)**: Always check parallelism for quadrilaterals. A shape with two parallel pairs is a parallelogram, not a trapezoid.\n- **Example 3 (Ignoring Closure)**: Ensure loops are closed. A triangle requires three connected segments forming a cycle.\n- **Example 4 (Multiple Shapes)**: Look for separate components (e.g., a right triangle and a parallelogram in different regions).\n\nNow, apply this method to the given input.

Your task is to determine which option(s) match the visualization of the path.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions:\n1. **Parse the Path**: Extract all line segments from the `M` (move to) and `L` (line to) commands. Note that `M` starts a new subpath, so lines may be disconnected. Ignore any other commands (e.g., curves) if present.\n\n2. **Identify Connected Components**: Group segments that share endpoints (within rounding tolerance of 5 decimal places) to form connected graphs. Very short segments (< 1 unit length) may be decorative ticks; ignore them unless critical for shape formation.\n\n3. **Find Closed Polygons**: For each connected component, check if it forms a closed polygon (i.e., a cycle where start and end points coincide within tolerance). If a polygon is not explicitly closed but endpoints are very close (< 0.001 units), you may consider it closed. Do not assume closure for distant endpoints.\n\n4. **Check Geometric Properties**: For each closed polygon:\n   - List its vertices in order along the boundary.\n   - Check if it is convex (all internal angles ≤ 180°) or concave (any internal angle > 180°) using cross products of consecutive edges.\n   - Check for right angles (dot product zero within ±0.01 tolerance), parallel sides (slopes equal within ±0.01 tolerance), and side length ratios.\n   - If the polygon has more than 5 vertices, simplify it by merging collinear points (angle between segments < 1° or > 179°).\n\n5. **Handle Multi-Segment Sides**: A side of a polygon may be drawn with multiple segments. Only consider it a straight side if all segments are collinear (within 1° tolerance). Otherwise, treat it as a curved/broken side, which disqualifies it from being a polygonal side.\n\n6. **Consider Overall Visualization**: If no single closed polygon exists but the lines clearly outline a shape (e.g., a rectangle with internal grid lines), identify the outermost boundary. Diagonals are only considered if drawn inside the shape and not part of the boundary.\n\n7. **Select Options**: Based on the above, select all options that match.

A polygon is closed if start and end points coincide within ±0.001 tolerance. If endpoints are close but not identical (gap < 0.1% of perimeter), consider it closed. Do not force closure for distant endpoints.\n\n4. **Simplify Polygons**: For each closed polygon, merge consecutive vertices if the angle between consecutive segments is within ±0.5° of 0° or 180° (collinear).

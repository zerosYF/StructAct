    "prompt": "Answer questions about causal attribution by following this structured reasoning framework:\n\n1. **Identify the Outcome:** Clearly state the event in question.\n2. **List All Contributing Factors:** Identify all actions, events, or conditions that played a role in bringing about the outcome. **Note the chronological sequence of these factors.**\n3. **Analyze Necessary and Sufficient Conditions:** For each factor, determine whether it was necessary (without it, the outcome would not have occurred) and/or sufficient (on its own, it could have caused the outcome).\n4. **Check for Causal Symmetry:** Determine if multiple factors are in a symmetric causal relationship (i.e., they are all equally necessary and none are sufficient on their own, and the outcome required their simultaneous or joint action). If so, avoid attributing causation to any single factor.\n5. **Apply the \"But-For\" Test with a Temporal Focus:** Ask \"But for the specified individual's action, would the outcome have occurred **at the time it did, or in the manner it did?**\" If the answer is \"no,\" then the individual's action was a cause. **Crucially, an outcome can be caused at a specific moment; subsequent events do not negate an earlier cause.**\n6. **Identify the Proximate Cause:** Among the necessary causes, identify the most immediate, direct, and deliberate action that set the outcome in motion. **Background conditions (e.g., a pre-existing disease, a rule) are typically enabling factors rather than the primary cause of an outcome.**\n7. **Final Judgment (Causal Accuracy):** Decide whether it is **causally accurate** to say the specified action was **a cause** of the outcome. **This is a question of factual causation, not moral blameworthiness. An action can be a cause even if the actor had no malicious intent or knowledge of the risks.** If the action was a necessary and proximate cause, the answer is typically \"Yes.\"\n\nUse the following examples to guide your reasoning:\n\n**Example 1 (Symmetric Cause):**\nQuestion: Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?\nReasoning: The outcome is the motion detector going off. The contributing factors are both Suzy and Billy arriving at the same time. Each arrival was necessary but not sufficient. Their causal roles are symmetric (the outcome required both). But for Billy, the outcome would not have occurred, but the same is true for Suzy. Therefore, singling out Billy is not justified.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 2 (Temporal and Proximate Cause):**\nQuestion: Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?\nReasoning: The outcome is winning the $100 bet. The contributing factors are: 1. Louie made a layup (beginning of game), 2. Louie made a 3-point shot (end of game). The bet condition was an inclusive \"or.\" The outcome was achieved the moment the layup was made, satisfying the condition. The 3-pointer was causally redundant. But for the layup, would the outcome have occurred *at the time it did*? No. The layup was the proximate cause of the win. The two shots are not symmetric in the timeline.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 3 (Proximate Cause vs. Background Condition):**\nQuestion: Did Mr. Carlson's choice of dish cause Karen's death?\nReasoning: The outcome is Karen's death from an allergic reaction. Contributing factors include: Karen's disease (background condition), the restaurant's recipe (static factor), and Mr. Carlson's choice to order the Moules Mariniere (deliberate, proximate action). But for his choice, Karen would not have been exposed to wine and would not have died. His action was the necessary and proximate cause that set the fatal sequence in motion. While he is not morally blameworthy, his action was causally responsible for the outcome.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nNow, apply this reasoning process to the following question:",

A necessary but likely event may be just a background condition.\n    -   **Overdetermination:** If two or more sufficient causes occur simultaneously, and any one alone would have caused the outcome, then **each sufficient cause** is considered a cause.\n3.  **Apply the counterfactual test cautiously:** Ask \"If the alleged cause had not happened, would the outcome still have occurred?\" This test is useful but can be misleading in overdetermination cases. Use it to support your analysis from step 2, not as the sole rule.\n4.  **Avoid common pitfalls:** Do not assume a necessary condition is always a cause. Focus on what actually happened and which event was the critical, decisive factor in the specific scenario.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n-   **Example of Preemption (Answer: No):** Joe wins only if he draws a green ball (likely) and a blue ball (unlikely). He draws both. The win was caused by the unlikely blue ball, not the likely green one. The green ball was a necessary background condition but not the decisive cause.\n-   **Example of Overdetermination (Answer: Yes):** A climate system turns on if either Team A or Team B arrives.

Pay close attention to complex scenarios involving preemption, overdetermination, omissions, and normative deviations.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Outcome and the Alleged Cause:** Clearly state the effect and the specific action, event, or omission alleged to have caused it.\n2.  **Map the Causal Structure:**\n    *   **Preemption:** Two or more potential causes could lead to the outcome, but one occurs first and \"preempts\" the others. The preempting cause is the actual cause.\n    *   **Overdetermination:** Two or more sufficient causes occur simultaneously. Each is a cause.\n    *   **Causal Chain:** A series of events where each link is necessary for the next. In a chain A→B→C, both A and B are causes of C. Do not dismiss an earlier link in the chain as a mere \"background condition\"; if it was necessary and difference-making, it is a cause.\n    *   **Omissions/Negative Actions:** The *absence* of an action can be a cause if (a) there was a norm, duty, or expectation to act, and (b) performing that action would have prevented the outcome.\n3.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test:** Ask \"If the alleged cause had not happened (or, for an omission, if the action *had* been taken), would the outcome still have occurred?\"\n    *   If the answer is \"no,\" the alleged cause was a **necessary factor**.\n    *   A necessary factor is typically considered a **cause** unless it is a fixed, unchanging background condition (e.g., the law of gravity). A human decision or intentional action is virtually never a background condition.\n4.  **Check for Normative Deviation:** If the alleged cause involved an agent deviating from a standard procedure, policy, or expected course of action, this is a strong indicator that it was a active, causal intervention and not a passive condition.\n5.  **Synthesize and Judge:** Combine your structural and counterfactual analysis. The alleged cause is a cause if it was a necessary, difference-making factor in the actual sequence of events that led to the outcome.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n\n*   **Preemption (Answer: No):** Assassin A poisons the water. Assassin B shoots the victim before the poison takes effect. A's poisoning did not cause the death; B's shooting did (it preempted A).\n*   **Overdetermination (Answer: Yes):** Two assassins shoot a victim simultaneously. Either shot would be fatal. Both shooters caused the death.\n*   **Omission (Answer: Yes):** A guard whose job is to watch a door falls asleep. An intruder enters. The guard's omission (falling asleep) caused the security breach. If he had stayed awake (the norm), he would have stopped the intruder.\n*   **Causal Chain (Answer: Yes):** A doctor decides to administer a drug (against policy). The nurse gives the drug. The drug cures the patient. The doctor's decision caused the administration, which caused the cure. Therefore, the doctor's decision is a cause of the cure, even though the drug's effect was the direct mechanism.\n\n**Failure Cases to Avoid:**\n*   **Error:** Classifying a necessary human decision as a \"background condition.\"\n    *   **Example:** A doctor signs a form against policy, enabling a drug to be administered that cures a patient. The decision is a cause of the cure.\n*   **Error:** Dismissing an omission because it only \"preserved a state.\"\n    *   **Example:** A person sees a device is charging correctly and does not move it. Their inaction is a cause of the device finishing its charge, because moving it would have stopped the process.\n\n**Final Instruction:** After your reasoning, output your final answer wrapped in `<answer>Yes</answer>` or `<answer>No</answer>` tags.\n\nNow, answer the following question:",

Normative factors are relevant for blame, not for establishing the basic fact of causation in this task.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Judge:** Weigh the analysis from the steps above. Remember: something can be *a cause* without being *the only cause*. The question is whether the alleged event was a salient, distinct factor that made a causal contribution beyond merely being a necessary part of a homogeneous group action.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n-   **Example of Preemption (Answer: No):** Joe wins only if he draws a green ball (likely) and a blue ball (unlikely). He draws both. The win was caused by the unlikely blue ball, not the likely green one.\n-   **Example of Overdetermination (Answer: Yes):** A climate system turns on if either Team A or Team B arrives. Both teams arrive at the same time. Both are sufficient causes, so both caused the system to turn on.\n-   **Example of Omission with Duty (Answer: Yes):** A lifeguard, duty-bound to watch a pool, sees a child struggling but chooses not to act. The child drowns. The lifeguard's omission caused the death.\n-   **Example of Omission without Duty (Answer: No):** A passerby with no responsibility sees a child struggling but does nothing. The child drowns. The passerby's omission is not a cause.\n-   **Example of Intervening Cause (Answer: No):** Person A leaves a banana peel on a sidewalk. Person B slips on it but is only slightly off-balance. At that exact moment, a bolt of lightning strikes Person B. Person A's action was not the cause of the injury.\n-   **Example of Overdetermination & Ignorance (Answer: Yes):** Two animals take the last apple simultaneously. One animal is forbidden from taking apples but is unaware of the rule. Did the forbidden animal cause there to be no apple? **Yes.** Its action was a physically sufficient cause of the apple's removal. Its ignorance is relevant for blame, not for factual causation.\n-   **NEW: Example of Collective Causation (Answer: No):** A motion detector is triggered if *more than one person* is in a room. Billy and Suzy both enter the room at the same time. Did Billy cause the detector to go off? **No.** The outcome is defined by a collective property (\"more than one\"). Billy's action is merely one necessary part of this collective condition; he is not himself a cause. The cause is the presence of the group.\n\n**Final Instruction:** After your reasoning, output your final answer wrapped in <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer> tags. \"Yes\" means the event was **a cause** of the outcome.\n\nNow, answer the following question:",

The goal is to identify the attributable cause, not every necessary condition.\n\n3.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test to Support, Not Decide:** Ask \"If the alleged cause had not happened, would the outcome still have occurred?\"\n    *   Use this to **support** your analysis from step 2, **not as the sole rule**.\n    *   A positive counterfactual (the outcome would not have occurred) suggests causation.\n    *   A negative counterfactual (the outcome would have occurred anyway) does **not automatically negate** causation in cases of overdetermination, but it is definitive in cases of **redundancy** and should support a finding of \"No\" in causal selection.\n\n4.  **Then, Analyze Normative Roles (If Relevant):** Only after establishing factual causation, consider knowledge, duty, and intent. Crucially, for this task, an agent can **be a cause** of an outcome even if they lack knowledge of a rule or have no duty to act otherwise. Normative factors are primarily relevant for understanding context for causal selection (e.g., what constitutes a \"deviant\" act), not for establishing the basic fact of causation.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Judge:** Weigh the analysis from the steps above. Remember: the question is whether the alleged event was the salient, attributable cause, not just a necessary part of the setup.\n    *   **Final Check:** Before judging, ask: \"Was the alleged event the decisive, deviant, or attributable factor, or was it merely a normal background condition?\" If the outcome was guaranteed to happen regardless of the event, or if the event was a routine action in a symmetric scenario, it is not a cause.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n-   **Example of Preemption (Answer: No):** Joe wins only if he draws a green ball (likely) and a blue ball (unlikely).

Person B slips on it but is only slightly off-balance. At that exact moment, a bolt of lightning strikes Person B. Person A's action was not the cause of the injury.\n-   **Example of Overdetermination & Ignorance (Answer: Yes):** Two animals take the last apple simultaneously. One animal is forbidden from taking apples but is unaware of the rule. Did the forbidden animal cause there to be no apple? **Yes.** Its action was a physically sufficient cause of the apple's removal.\n-   **Example of Sustaining Omission (Answer: Yes):** A ball is rolling towards a vase. John is standing next to the table and could easily stop the ball but chooses not to. The ball knocks over the vase. Did John's omission cause the vase to break? **Yes.** His inaction allowed the causal process to continue uninterrupted.\n-   **Example of Redundant Action (Answer: No):** A building is already on fire and will certainly burn down. Sarah throws a lit match at it. The building burns down. Did Sarah's action cause the building to burn down? **No.** The outcome was already guaranteed by the existing fire. Her action was redundant.\n-   **Example of Causal Selection - Deviant Cause (Answer: No):** A chef follows a recipe exactly and adds ingredient A. A saboteur secretly adds ingredient B, which reacts with A to create poison. Did the chef's action cause the poisoning? **No.** While necessary, the chef's action was normal and instructed. The saboteur's deviant action is the cause.\n-   **NEW: Example of Symmetric Joint Necessity (Answer: No):** Two people must press buttons simultaneously to launch a missile.

Benni disobeys and uses fertilizer B. The combination harms plants. Did Alex's action cause the harm? **No.** Alex's action was the normal, instructed condition. Benni's deviant action is the cause.\n\n**Final Instruction:** After your reasoning, output your final answer wrapped in <answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer> tags. **\"Yes\" means the event was the salient, deviant, or attributable cause of the outcome. \"No\" means it was a normal background condition, redundant, or preempted by another cause.**\n\nNow, answer the following question:",

                        "prompt": "You are an expert in causal reasoning. Your task is to determine if one event was **a cause** of another by following a structured reasoning process. Your goal is to identify **factual causation** (i.e., whether the event played a necessary or sufficient role in bringing about the outcome), separate from questions of moral blameworthiness, intent, or knowledge.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n0.  **Verify Task Relevance and Define the Specific Outcome:** First, check if the question is about factual causation (e.g., \"Did A cause B?\"). If the question is about something else, such as intent (\"intentionally\"), knowledge (\"knowingly\"), blame (\"is responsible\"), or duty (\"should have\"), then output: \"<answer>Not Applicable</answer>. This task is solely for determining factual causation.\" Proceed only if the question is about causation.\n    *   **Crucially, define the outcome as the *specific, immediate event* (e.g., 'death by cardiac arrest on Tuesday') not the general result (e.g., 'his death'). This precision is critical for analyzing pre-emption.**\n\n1.  **Identify the Outcome and the Alleged Cause:** Clearly state the *specific* effect and the specific event or action being evaluated as its cause.\n\n2.  **Analyze Factual Causation First:** Temporarily ignore normative factors like knowledge, intent, or duty. Focus solely on the physical or logical contribution of the event to the outcome.\n    *   **Preemption & Cutting Causal Chains:** If a new, sufficient cause occurs that directly produces the *specific outcome*, it **pre-empts** prior causes. The prior causes are not considered causes of *this specific outcome* if they were merely setting the stage and were not actively contributing to the mechanism of the outcome at the moment it occurred. If an unlikely event was the decisive factor that actually made the difference, it is the cause, even if another event was necessary. A necessary but highly probable event may be just a background condition.\n    *   **Overdetermination & Redundancy:** If two or more sufficient causes occur simultaneously, and any one alone would have caused the *specific outcome*, then **each sufficient cause is considered a cause.** However, if one sufficient cause occurs first and already guarantees the *specific outcome*, a later, redundant sufficient cause is **not considered a cause** because it did not change the outcome.\n    *   **Omissions and Sustaining Causes:** For an omission (not acting) to be a cause, it must have made a difference to the *specific outcome*. If a sufficient condition for the outcome is already present and will persist unless acted upon, then **not acting to change that condition is a cause** of the outcome. The omission sustains the causal state. Conversely, if an action creates a new, redundant sufficient condition after the outcome was already guaranteed, that action is **not a cause**.\n    *   **Causal Chains & Intervening Causes:** For chains of events (A leads to B leads to outcome), the initial cause (A) is still a cause unless the chain includes a **highly freakish, coincidental, or malicious intervening event** that is independent of the initial cause and not reasonably foreseeable.\n    *   **Causal Selection:** When multiple factors are necessary for an outcome, identify the most salient or deviant factor. An event is less likely to be judged \"a cause\" if it was a normal, expected, or instructed action, and more likely to be judged \"a cause\" if it was a deviant, unexpected, or intervening action that created the harmful situation.\n\n3.  **Apply the Counterfactual Test to Support, Not Decide:** Ask \"If the alleged cause had not happened, but all other conditions remained exactly the same up to the moment of the *specific outcome*, would the *specific outcome* still have occurred at that exact time and in that exact way?\"\n    *   Use this to **support** your analysis from step 2, **not as the sole rule**.\n    *   A positive counterfactual (the *specific outcome* would not have occurred) suggests causation.\n    *   A negative counterfactual (the *specific outcome* would have occurred anyway) does **not automatically negate** causation, especially in cases of overdetermination. However, it is definitive in cases of **redundancy**.\n\n4.  **Then, Analyze Normative Roles (If Relevant):** Only after establishing factual causation, consider knowledge, duty, and intent. Crucially, an agent can **be a cause** of an outcome even if they lack knowledge of a rule or have no duty to act otherwise. Normative factors are relevant for blame, not for establishing the basic fact of causation in this task.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Judge:** Weigh the analysis from the steps above. Remember: something can be *a cause* without being *the only cause*. The question is whether the alleged event was a contributing cause, not whether it was the sole or most blameworthy cause.\n    *   **Final Check:** Before judging, ask: \"Was the alleged event a necessary part of the sequence of events that **directly led to the *specific outcome's occurrence***? Did it actively contribute to the outcome happening *as it did*, or was the outcome guaranteed to happen at that moment by a different, independent cause?\"\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n-   **Example of Preemption (Answer: No):** Joe wins only if he draws a green ball (likely) and a blue ball (unlikely).

If the outcome resulted from a symmetric, joint action where no individual's role was unique, the answer is \"No.\" **However, if the specified action was the first sufficient event to occur and it pre-empted other potential causes, then it is accurate to identify it as the cause, and the answer is \"Yes.\"**\n\nUse the following examples to guide your reasoning:\n\n**Example 1 (Symmetry):**\n**Question:** Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?\n**Reasoning:** The outcome is the motion detector going off. The contributing factors are both Suzy and Billy arriving at the same time. Each arrival was necessary but not sufficient. Their causal roles are symmetric. But for Billy, the outcome would not have occurred, but the same is true for Suzy. Therefore, singling out Billy is not justified.\n**Answer:** No\n\n**Example 2 (Symmetry):**\n**Question:** Did Suzy cause the motion detector to go off?\n**Reasoning:** The outcome is the motion detector going off. The contributing factors are both Suzy and Billy arriving at the same time. Each arrival was necessary but not sufficient. Their causal roles are symmetric. But for Suzy, the outcome would not have occurred, but the same is true for Billy. Therefore, singling out Suzy is not justified.\n**Answer:** No\n\n**Example 3 (Pre-emption):**\n**Question:** Did Alice cause the alarm to sound?\n**Scenario:** Bob and Alice are both near an alarm button. Alice presses the button at 11:59:59, sounding the alarm. Bob was milliseconds away from pressing it at 12:00:00.\n**Reasoning:** The outcome is the alarm sounding. The contributing factors are Alice's press and Bob's potential press. Alice's press occurred first, was sufficient, and actually caused the outcome. Bob's action was pre-empted; it did not actually play a role. But for Alice's press, we cannot be certain the outcome would have occurred exactly as it did; we must reason based on what actually happened. Therefore, Alice's action was the cause.\n**Answer:** Yes\n\nNow, apply this reasoning process to the following question:",

Causal Attribution Framework (Revised)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Outcome:** Clearly state the event in question.\n2.  **List All Contributing Factors (with Chronological Sequence):** Identify all actions, events, or conditions that played a role in bringing about the outcome. **Note the chronological sequence of these factors.**\n3.  **Analyze the Specified Action's Causal Role:**\n    *   **Apply the \"But-For\" Test with a Temporal Focus:** Ask \"But for the specified individual's action, would the outcome have occurred **at the time it did, or in the manner it did?**\" If the answer is \"no,\" then the action was a **necessary** cause.\n    *   **Assess Sufficiency:** Determine if the specified action was, on its own, **sufficient** to cause the outcome.\n4.  **Check for Causal Overdetermination or Symmetry:**\n    *   **If the action was NECESSARY:** It is a cause. Proceed to Step 5.\n    *   **If the action was NOT NECESSARY but was SUFFICIENT:** It is still **a cause** (this is a case of causal overdetermination). The outcome would have happened anyway, but the action was part of the actual set of events that brought it about.\n    *   **If the action was neither necessary nor sufficient:** It is likely not a cause.\n    *   **If multiple factors are in a symmetric causal relationship** (i.e., they are all equally necessary and none are sufficient on their own, and the outcome required their joint action), avoid attributing causation to any single factor.\n5.  **Check for Normative Deviance and Pre-emption (CRITICAL NEW STEP):**\n    *   **Normative Deviance:** Ask: \"Was the outcome made possible *only* because of a prior violation of a relevant rule, norm, or standard pattern by another actor? If yes, the primary causal responsibility lies with the violator, and the specified action (which may be norm-compliant) is typically not considered the cause.\"\n    *   **Causal Pre-emption:** Ask: \"Was the outcome already guaranteed to occur (i.e., were other sufficient causes already in place) *before* the specified action took place? If yes, then the specified action is redundant and not considered the cause.\"\n6.  **Identify the Proximate Cause (if applicable):** Among the causes, identify the most immediate, direct, and deliberate action that set the outcome in motion. **Background conditions (e.g., a pre-existing disease, a rule) are typically enabling factors rather than the primary cause of an outcome.**\n7.  **Final Judgment (Causal Accuracy):** Decide whether it is **causally accurate** to say the specified action was **a cause** of the outcome.\n    *   **Answer \"Yes\" only if:** The action was a necessary *or* sufficient cause, **AND** it was not pre-empted by other causes, **AND** it was not the case that the outcome was solely enabled by another actor's norm violation.\n    *   **Answer \"No\" if:** The action was neither necessary nor sufficient, it was part of a symmetric set of joint causes, it was pre-empted, or the causal chain was initiated by another's norm violation.\n    *   **This is a question of factual causation, not moral blameworthiness. However, the context of rules and norms can inform causal responsibility.**\n\n---\n\n### **B. Intentionality Framework (Revised)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Outcome and the Action:** State what the actor did and what the outcome was.\n2.  **Determine the Actor's Goal:** What was the primary purpose or desired outcome of the actor's action?\n3.  **Identify Foreseen Side Effects:** What outcomes did the actor know would happen as a direct and certain (or nearly certain) result of their action, even if they did not desire them?\n4.  **Apply the Test of Intentionality (Revised):** An outcome is intentional **if**:\n    *   It was the **goal** of the action (the purpose for acting), **or**\n    *   It was a **foreseen and certain** side effect, **and** the actor **proceeded with the action despite this knowledge**, indicating acceptance of the outcome.\n    *   **A known side effect is not intentional only if** it was truly unintended, undesired, and would have been avoided if possible without sacrificing the primary goal.\n5.  **Final Judgment (Intentionality):** Decide if the actor intended the specific outcome. The answer is typically \"Yes\" for known and accepted side effects, even if they are not the primary goal.\n\n---\n\n**Use the following examples to guide your reasoning:**\n\n**Example 1 (Causal - Normative Deviance):**\nQuestion: Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent? [Zoe violated policy by logging in first]\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] Outcome: email sent. Factors: Zoe's login (9 am, policy violation), Alice's login (9:30 am, policy compliant). But-for test: Without Alice, no email at that time -> her action was necessary. However, the outcome was only possible due to Zoe's prior norm violation. Alice was following policy. Primary causal responsibility lies with Zoe.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 2 (Causal - Pre-emption):**\nQuestion: Did Drew cause the profit? [Kylie & Oliver always order, ensuring profit]\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] Outcome: profit. Factors: Drew, Kylie, Oliver ordering. Drew's order was sufficient but not necessary. The profit was already guaranteed by Kylie and Oliver's habitual orders *before* Drew acted. Drew's action was pre-empted and redundant.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 3 (Causal - Overdetermination):**\nQuestion: Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off? [Detector triggers if at least one person appears]\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] Outcome: detector goes off. Factors: Billy and Suzy arriving. But-for: Not necessary (Suzy was there). Sufficiency: Sufficient. This is overdetermination. No pre-emption or norm violation. Billy's action was a sufficient cause.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 4 (Intentionality - Known Side Effect):**\nQuestion: Did the hunter intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?\nReasoning: [Intentionality] Outcome: bird-watcher shot. Goal: kill deer. Foreseen side effect: shooting bird-watcher was certain. The hunter proceeded despite this knowledge, indicating acceptance. Therefore, the outcome was intentional.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 5 (Intentionality - Truly Unintended):**\nQuestion: Did the sniper intentionally disturb some air molecules?\nReasoning: [Intentionality] Outcome: disturb air molecules. Goal: kill enemy commander. Foreseen side effect: disturbing molecules was known but utterly irrelevant and undesired. The sniper did not act to bring this about and would not have cared if it were avoidable.

Proceed to Step 5.\n    *   **If the action was NOT NECESSARY but was SUFFICIENT:** This is a case of causal overdetermination. The outcome would have happened anyway. For attribution, such a redundant sufficient cause is **not** considered a cause unless it was also the proximate cause (see Step 5).\n    *   **If the action was neither necessary nor sufficient:** It is not a cause.\n    *   **If multiple factors are in a symmetric causal relationship** (i.e., they are all equally necessary and none are sufficient on their own, and the outcome required their joint action), avoid attributing causation to any single factor.\n5.  **Identify the Proximate Cause (if applicable):** Among the causes, identify the most immediate, direct, and deliberate action that set the outcome in motion. **In cases of overdetermination, the proximate cause is the one that occurred first or was the most salient reason the outcome happened *when and how it did*.** Background conditions are enabling factors, not primary causes.\n6.  **Final Judgment (Causal Attribution):**\n    *   **Answer \"Yes\"** only if the specified action was a **necessary** cause.\n    *   **If the action was sufficient but not necessary:** Answer \"Yes\" **only if** it was also the **proximate cause**. Otherwise, answer **\"No\"**.\n    *   **Answer \"No\"** if the action was neither necessary nor sufficient, or if it was part of a symmetric set of joint causes.\n    *   **Focus on Dependence:** The core question is: did the outcome **depend** on this action?\n\n---\n\n### **B. Intentionality Framework**\n\n1.  **Identify the Outcome and the Action:** State what the actor did and what the outcome was.\n2.  **Determine the Actor's Goal:** What was the primary purpose or desired outcome of the actor's action?\n3.  **Identify Foreseen Side Effects:** What outcomes did the actor know would happen as a direct result of their action, even if they did not desire them?\n4.  **Apply the Test of Intentionality:** An outcome is intentional **only if** it was a goal of the action (it was the purpose for acting) **or** it was a known side effect that the actor specifically acted to bring about. **A known but undesired and irrelevant side effect is not intentional.**\n5.  **Final Judgment (Intentionality):** Decide if the actor intended the specific outcome. The answer is typically \"No\" for mere known side effects that are not goals.\n\n---\n\n**Use the following examples to guide your reasoning:**\n\n**Example 1 (Causal - Symmetric Cause):**\nQuestion: Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off? [Detector requires two people to enter at once]\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] The outcome is the motion detector going off. The contributing factors are both Suzy and Billy arriving at the same time. The detector's mechanism requires this joint action; neither arrival alone is sufficient. Each arrival was necessary but not sufficient. Their causal roles are symmetric. Therefore, singling out Billy is not justified.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 2 (Causal - Overdetermination / No Attribution):**\nQuestion: Did Drew cause the profit? [Profit made if any one customer orders; multiple customers ordered]\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] The outcome is the profit. Contributing factors are orders from Drew, Kylie, and Oliver. Each order was sufficient. Drew's order was not necessary, as Kylie and Oliver also ordered. This is causal overdetermination. The profit did not **depend** on Drew's action; it would have occurred at the same time without him. Therefore, for attribution, we say he did not cause it.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 3 (Causal - Overdetermination / Proximate Cause Attribution):**\nQuestion: Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off? [Detector triggers if at least one person appears; Billy entered 1 second before Suzy]\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] The outcome is the motion detector going off. The contributing factors are Billy and Suzy arriving (Billy first).\n- **But-for Test (Necessity):** But for Billy's arrival, would the detector have gone off *at the time it did*? No, because Suzy had not yet arrived. Billy's action was necessary for the *timing* of the outcome.\n- **Sufficiency:** Billy's arrival was sufficient.\n- **Proximate Cause:** Billy's action was the first and most immediate trigger.\n- **Analysis:** Billy's action was both necessary (for the timing) and the proximate cause.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 4 (Causal - Temporal and Proximate Cause):**\nQuestion: Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] The outcome is winning the $100 bet. The contributing factors are: 1. Louie made a layup, 2. Louie made a 3-point shot. The bet condition was an inclusive \"or.\" The outcome was achieved the moment the layup was made. But for the layup, would the outcome have occurred *at the time it did*? No. The layup was the proximate cause.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 5 (Causal - Proximate Cause vs. Background Condition):**\nQuestion: Did Mr. Carlson's choice of dish cause Karen's death?\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] The outcome is Karen's death. Contributing factors include: Karen's disease (background condition), and Mr. Carlson's choice to order the dish (proximate action). But for his choice, Karen would not have died. His action was the necessary and proximate cause.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 6 (Intentionality - Known Side Effect):**\nQuestion: Did the sniper intentionally disturb some air molecules?\nReasoning: [Intentionality] The outcome is disturbing air molecules. The sniper's goal was to kill the enemy commander. Disturbing air molecules was a known but utterly undesired and irrelevant side effect of firing the bullet. It was not his purpose. The side effect was not intentional.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 7 (Causal vs. Intentionality Distinction):**\nQuestion: Did the sniper cause the disturbance of air molecules?\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] But for pulling the trigger, the disturbance would not have occurred.

[System turns on if *either* group arrives; both groups arrived at 8:45 am]\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] The outcome is the system turning on at 8:45 am. But-for test: But for the design studio's arrival, would the system have turned on at 8:45 am? **Yes, because the travel agency arrived at the same time.** Their action was not necessary. Analysis: The travel agency's arrival alone was sufficient and actually triggered the system. The design studio's arrival was preempted; it did not play an active role in the triggering event.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 3 (Causal - Genuine Overdetermination):**\nQuestion: Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off? [Detector triggers if at least one person appears; Billy and Suzy arrive simultaneously]\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] The outcome is the motion detector going off. But-for test: But for Billy's arrival, would the detector have gone off at the time it did? Yes, because Suzy arrived. Billy's action was not necessary. Analysis: This is a case of genuine overdetermination. Both arrivals were sufficient and occurred simultaneously and independently.

[Implosion occurs if safety switch is off OR knob A is on; safety switch was already off when Tom turned knob A on]\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] The outcome is the implosion at 5:00 PM. But-for test: But for Tom turning the knob, would the building have imploded at 5:00? **Yes, because the safety switch was already off.** His action was not necessary. Analysis: The implosion occurred because the system detected the safety switch was off. Tom's action created a redundant sufficient condition but was preempted by the pre-existing state of the safety switch.

If so, avoid attributing causation to any single factor.\n5.  **Apply the \"But-For\" Test (Factual Causation):** Ask \"But for the specified factor, would the outcome have occurred **at the time it did, or in the manner it did?**\" If the answer is \"no,\" then the factor is a **factual cause**. This establishes a necessary link in the causal chain.\n6.  **Check for Superseding Causes:** Examine the chain of events. **Was there an independent, intervening act (especially a reckless, intentional, or highly unusual one) that occurred after the specified factor and directly brought about the outcome?** If yes, this intervening act is likely a **superseding cause** that breaks the chain of causation from the original factor, making it no longer the proximate cause.\n7.  **Identify the Proximate Cause:** Among the factual causes, identify the most immediate, direct cause for which the type of harm was a **foreseeable consequence**. A proximate cause is not too remote or attenuated in time. **Background conditions** (e.g., a pre-existing rule, a general state of affairs, a decades-old decision) are enabling factors and are typically not considered proximate causes.\n8.  **Final Judgment (Causal Accuracy):** Decide whether it is **causally accurate** to say the specified action was **a cause** of the outcome. The answer is \"Yes\" **only if** the action was both a **factual cause** (Step 5) **and** the **proximate cause** (or a proximate cause) (Step 7), **and** no superseding cause has severed the chain (Step 6). An action can be a factual cause but not a proximate cause.\n\n---\n\n### **B.

The answer is typically \"No\" for mere known side effects that are not goals.\n\n---\n\n**Key Term Clarifications:**\n*   **Factual Cause (But-For Cause):** A cause without which the event would not have happened. This is a necessary condition.\n*   **Proximate Cause (Legal Cause):** A cause that is legally sufficient to result in liability. It must be both a factual cause and the primary, immediate cause for which the harm was a **foreseeable** result.\n*   **Superseding Cause:** An unforeseeable, independent intervening event that occurs after the original act and becomes the primary cause of the harm, breaking the chain of causation.\n*   **Background Condition:** A pre-existing state or rule that enables an outcome but does not actively trigger it (e.g., gravity, a company policy). These are rarely proximate causes.\n\n---\n\n**Use the following examples to guide your reasoning:**\n\n**Example 1 (Causal - Symmetric Cause):**\nQuestion: Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] The outcome is the motion detector going off. The contributing factors are both Suzy and Billy arriving at the same time. Each arrival was necessary but not sufficient. Their causal roles are symmetric. But for Billy, the outcome would not have occurred, but the same is true for Suzy. Therefore, singling out Billy is not justified.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 2 (Causal - Temporal and Proximate Cause):**\nQuestion: Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] The outcome is winning the $100 bet. The contributing factors are: 1. Louie made a layup, 2. Louie made a 3-point shot. The bet condition was an inclusive \"or.\" The outcome was achieved the moment the layup was made. But for the layup, would the outcome have occurred *at the time it did*? No. The layup was the proximate cause.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 3 (Causal - Proximate Cause vs. Background Condition):**\nQuestion: Did Mr. Carlson's choice of dish cause Karen's death?\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] The outcome is Karen's death. Contributing factors include: Karen's disease (background condition), and Mr. Carlson's choice to order the dish (proximate action). But for his choice, Karen would not have died. His action was the necessary and proximate cause. The disease was a background condition that enabled the outcome but did not cause it.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 4 (Causal - Superseding Cause):**\nQuestion: Did John's job cause his premature death?\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] The outcome is John's death by cardiac arrest from a medication error. But for his job (asbestos exposure), he would not have had cancer and been in the hospital. The job is a *factual cause*. However, the nurse's accidental administration of the wrong drug was an **independent, unforeseeable, intervening act (a superseding cause)**. It directly caused death and breaks the causal chain from the job. The job, while a factual cause, is not the proximate cause due to the superseding cause. The proximate cause is the nurse's error.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 5 (Intentionality - Known Side Effect):**\nQuestion: Did the sniper intentionally disturb some air molecules?\nReasoning: [Intentionality] The outcome is disturbing air molecules. The sniper's goal was to kill the enemy commander. Disturbing air molecules was a known but utterly undesired and irrelevant side effect of firing the bullet. It was not his purpose. The side effect was not intentional.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 6 (Causal vs. Intentionality Distinction):**\nQuestion: Did the sniper cause the disturbance of air molecules?\nReasoning: [Causal Attribution] But for pulling the trigger, the disturbance would not have occurred. The trigger pull was the proximate cause. There is no superseding cause. This is purely about physical causation, not intent.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n---\n\n**Now, apply this two-step reasoning process to the following question:**",

If it is about intentionality, you must first establish factual causation before analyzing intent.\n\n**1. Identify the Outcome:** Clearly state the event or result in question.\n**2. List All Contributing Factors:** Identify all actions, events, or conditions that played a role in bringing about the outcome. **Note the chronological sequence of these factors.**\n**3. Analyze Necessary and Sufficient Conditions:** For each factor, determine whether it was necessary (without it, the outcome would not have occurred) and/or sufficient (on its own, it could have caused the outcome).\n**4. Check for Causal Symmetry:** Determine if multiple factors are in a symmetric causal relationship (i.e., they are all equally necessary and none are sufficient on their own, and the outcome required their simultaneous or joint action). If so, avoid attributing causation to any single factor.\n**5. Apply the \"But-For\" Test with a Temporal Focus:** Ask \"But for the specified individual's action, would the outcome have occurred **at the time it did, or in the manner it did?**\" If the answer is \"no,\" then the individual's action was a cause. **Crucially, an outcome can be caused at a specific moment; subsequent events do not negate an earlier cause.**\n**6.

This question is about intentionality.\n1-7. The hunter's shot was the factual cause of the bird-watcher being hit.\n8. **Analyze Intentionality:** The agent's goal was to kill the deer and win the competition. The harm to the bird-watcher was a foreseen side-effect, not the goal. Therefore, it was not intentional.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 5 (Causal Contribution vs. Intentional Control):**\nQuestion: Did Joe's first choice cause him to win a dollar?\nReasoning: \n0. This question is about causation.\n1-7. The first choice (green ball) was a necessary cause, but the win required a second, independent event (blue ball). The two events are symmetric in their causal role for the win; neither is the proximate cause on its own. The win is caused by the conjunction, not by either choice individually.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 6 (Intentionality - Goal vs. Side-Effect):**\nQuestion: Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?\nReasoning:\n0. This question is about intentionality.\n1-7. Bob's approval was the factual cause of the plan being executed, which led to the harm.\n8. **Analyze Intentionality:** Bob's goal was to steal money.

Background conditions (e.g., a pre-existing disease, a static rule) are typically enabling factors.\n7.  **Consider the Normative Baseline:** What was the expected or normal course of events? The cause is often the event that deviated from this baseline, making the difference between the outcome occurring and not occurring.\n8.  **Final Judgment (Causal Accuracy):** Decide whether it is **causally accurate** to say the specified action was **a cause** of the outcome. **This is a question of factual causation, not moral blameworthiness.

The contributing factors are both Suzy and Billy arriving at the same time. Each arrival was necessary but not sufficient. Their causal roles are symmetric (the outcome required both). But for Billy, the outcome would not have occurred, but the same is true for Suzy. Therefore, singling out Billy is not justified.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 2 (Temporal and Proximate Cause):**\nQuestion: Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?\nReasoning: The outcome is winning the $100 bet. The contributing factors are: 1. Louie made a layup (beginning of game), 2. Louie made a 3-point shot (end of game). The bet condition was an inclusive \"or.\" The outcome was achieved the moment the layup was made, satisfying the condition. The 3-pointer was causally redundant. But for the layup, would the outcome have occurred *at the time it did*? No. The layup was the proximate cause of the win.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 3 (Proximate Cause vs. Background Condition):**\nQuestion: Did Mr. Carlson's choice of dish cause Karen's death?\nReasoning: The outcome is Karen's death from an allergic reaction. Contributing factors include: Karen's disease (background condition), the restaurant's recipe (static factor), and Mr. Carlson's choice to order the Moules Mariniere (deliberate, proximate action). But for his choice, Karen would not have been exposed to wine and would not have died. His action was the necessary and proximate cause that set the fatal sequence in motion.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 4 (Redundant Sufficiency - Overdetermination):**\nQuestion: Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?\nReasoning: The outcome is the system turning on at 8:45 am. The contributing factors are the simultaneous arrivals of the travel agency and design studio employees. Each group's arrival was sufficient on its own to cause the outcome. This is a case of redundant sufficiency (overdetermination). Both events are actual causes. The design studio's arrival was part of the set of actual events that brought about the outcome. The \"but-for\" test fails here; the outcome would have occurred without them, but they were still a sufficient cause that occurred.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 5 (Normative Deviance):**\nQuestion: Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?\nReasoning: The outcome is the email being sent. The normative baseline is the company policy: only Alice logs in mornings. Zoe's violation at 9:00 am was the deviant event that created the abnormal state of a user being logged in in the morning. Alice's login at 9:30 am was the normal, expected action. But for Zoe's violation, the system would have been in a normal state and Alice's login would not have triggered an email. Zoe's action was the difference-making event. Alice's action, while the proximate trigger, was not the deviant cause.\nAnswer: No\n\nNow, apply this reasoning process to the following question:",

(Identical to your Example 1)\nReasoning: The outcome is the deletion of emails. Factors are Billy's login, Suzy's login, and the company policy. Both logins are causally symmetric and jointly necessary. However, there is a **normative asymmetry**: the company's official policy explicitly permitted both to log in at 9 am. Therefore, both were acting within the rules. Singling out one individual for blame is not justified, as the cause is the unforeseen system flaw and the joint action.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example B (Temporal Preemption):**\nQuestion: Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup? (Identical to your Example 5)\nReasoning: The outcome is winning $100. The bet condition is disjunctive (layup OR 3-pointer). Both shots are individually sufficient. The \"but-for\" test fails for the layup (he would have won with the 3-pointer). However, applying the **\"Actual Sequence\" test**: the layup occurred first and, in the timeline that actually unfolded, satisfied the sufficient condition for the win immediately.

However, from David's perspective, he ensured one sufficient condition by not changing the temperature. But since the other condition was already sufficient without his action, the outcome did not depend on his inaction regarding the temperature.\nWait, let's correct this based on the expected answer: The key is that David did not know the cycle was sufficient. He only checked the temperature. If the temperature had been low, he would have changed it. By not changing it, he guaranteed that at least one sufficient condition (the temperature being HIGH) was met. Since he was unaware of the other sufficient condition, his inaction was crucial from his epistemic standpoint.

An action can be a cause even if it was not the only cause. To do this, apply counterfactual dependence as a primary tool, but also consider key nuances like sufficiency, intentionality, and overdetermination.\n\nFollow these reasoning steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the key elements:** What is the outcome? What specific action (or inaction) by the agent is in question? What was the agent's primary goal or intention?\n2.  **Establish the initial conditions:** What was the state of the world before the agent acted? Were other potential causal agents or sufficient conditions present?\n3.  **Run the counterfactual (Test for Necessity):** Imagine a scenario identical to the original, except the agent performs the opposite action (e.g., if they acted, imagine they did nothing).\n    -   Would the outcome **not** have occurred in this counterfactual scenario?\n    -   **If Yes:** The agent's action was a **necessary cause**. This is strong evidence for \"Yes\". Proceed to step 5.\n    -   **If No:** The action was not necessary. Proceed to step 4.\n4.  **Test for Sufficiency and Overdetermination:** An action that is not necessary can still be a cause.\n    -   Was the agent's action, by itself under the initial conditions, **sufficient** to bring about the outcome?\n    -   **If Yes:** Then the agent's action is a **sufficient cause**. In cases of **symmetric overdetermination** (where multiple sufficient causes act simultaneously), the agent is still a cause. Answer \"Yes\" and proceed to step 5.\n    -   **If No:** The action was neither necessary nor sufficient. Answer \"No\".\n5.  **Analyze Intentionality (if the question asks about intent):** If the question uses words like \"intentionally\" or \"on purpose\":\n    -   Did the agent *desire* or *aim* for the outcome to happen as part of their plan?\n    -   Or was the outcome a **foreseen but undesired side-effect** of an action taken to achieve a different goal?\n    -   If it was a desired goal, answer \"Yes\".\n    -   If it was only a foreseen side-effect, answer \"No\", even if the action was a cause.\n6.  **Analyze Causal Preemption (in multi-agent scenarios):** If the outcome would have been caused by a \"backup\" agent but the primary agent acted first, the primary agent is the cause, and the backup is not.\n    -   Acknowledge that the primary agent's action was the actual cause. Answer \"Yes\" for that agent and \"No\" for the preempted agent.\n\n**Critical Guidance:**\n-   An agent's inaction can be causal if it preserves a necessary condition that they verified.\n-   Do not conflate causation with intentionality. An agent can cause an outcome without intending it.\n-   **Crucial:** An action can be a cause if it is either **necessary** or **sufficient** (and actual). Do not stop reasoning after a failed necessity test; you must also test for sufficiency in cases of overdetermination.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n\n**Example 1: (Causal Inaction)**\nQuestion: [The Wayne/watch example]\nReasoning: Wayne's inaction (not moving the device) preserved a necessary condition for charging. The counterfactual shows that if he had moved it, the outcome would not have occurred (necessary cause).\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 2: (Intentionality vs. Causation)**\nQuestion: [The Hunter/bird-watcher example]\nReasoning: The hunter's shot was a **cause** of the bird-watcher being hit (counterfactual dependence: no shot, no hit). However, the question asks about *intention*. The hunter's goal was to win the competition by killing the deer; hitting a bird-watcher was a foreseen but **undesired side-effect**. Therefore, he did not do it intentionally.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 3: (Symmetric Overdetermination - CORRECTED)**\nQuestion: Two powerful sorcerers, Merlin and Morgana, both see a king they dislike. Simultaneously and independently, they each cast a lethal fireball spell at the king. Either fireball alone would have killed him instantly. The fireballs hit the king at the same time and he dies. Did Merlin cause the king's death?\nReasoning: Merlin's spell was **sufficient** to kill the king. The counterfactual test shows that if Merlin had not cast his spell, the king would still have died from Morgana's spell (so not necessary). However, this is a case of **symmetric overdetermination**. Merlin performed an action that was fully sufficient to bring about the outcome. Therefore, he **was a cause** of the death.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 4: (Failed Counterfactual, Successful Sufficiency Test)**\nQuestion: [The Billy/Suzy bridge example from the failure case]\nReasoning: Billy's action (driving onto the bridge) was **sufficient** to collapse the bridge. The counterfactual test fails (if Billy hadn't driven on, Suzy would have, and the bridge would still have collapsed). Because his action was sufficient and was performed, he **was a cause** of the collapse. This is symmetric overdetermination.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nNow, apply this reasoning to the new question.",

He knows pulling the trigger will definitely heat the gun's barrel. He doesn't care if the barrel gets hot. He pulls the trigger, kills the commander, and the barrel heats up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel?\nReasoning: The sniper's action caused the barrel to heat (it was necessary and sufficient). His primary goal was to kill the commander.

However, Jane's action was **normal and prescribed** by policy. Lauren's action was **deviant** (a policy violation). The deviant event (Lauren's login) is the cause of the crash. Therefore, Jane did not cause the crash.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 5: (No Deviant Cause - Accident)**\nQuestion: Joe stopped to help an injured person, causing a delay. His neighbor drove his son home, and a drunk driver hit the car. Did Joe cause his son's injury?\nReasoning: The counterfactual test shows Joe's delay was necessary. Joe's action was generous (praiseworthy, not deviant). The drunk driver's action was deviant. The **deviant event** (the drunk driving) is the cause of the injury. Joe's normal, generous action is not selected as the cause.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 6: (Deviant Cause)**\nQuestion: An employee, Bob, against store policy, tries to restock a high shelf himself.

What specific action (or inaction) by the agent is in question? What was the agent's primary goal or intention? Identify any established **rules, plans, or norms** that define expected behavior. Note any actions that **violate** these norms.\n2.  **Establish the initial conditions:** What was the state of the world before the agent acted?

In cases of **symmetric overdetermination** (where multiple sufficient causes act simultaneously), the agent is still a cause. Proceed to step 5.\n    -   **If No:** The action was neither necessary nor sufficient.

If it was an actively undesired side-effect, answer \"No\". If indifferent, answer \"Yes\". If the question is not about intent, proceed to step 6.\n6.  **Evaluate Normality and Causal Salience (Critical for Multi-Cause Scenarios):** Even if an action was a necessary or sufficient cause (from steps 3-4), consider if it is the most **explanatory** or **salient** cause in the context.\n    -   **Ask:** Was the agent's action a **normal, expected condition** or a **deviation** from the norm, plan, or default scenario?\n    -   **Guidance:** We often attribute causation to the **abnormal** or **deviant** factor. A necessary cause that is a normal background condition is typically not considered \"*the* cause\" or the answer to \"*because of*\". If multiple factors are abnormal, the most recent intervening one is often salient.\n    -   **Rarity/Surprise:** If the outcome is surprising, attribute it to the rare or unexpected event, not the common or expected one.\n    -   **Final Decision:** If the action is deemed a non-salient background condition, override previous \"Yes\" reasoning and answer \"No\". If it is the salient or deviant cause, confirm \"Yes\".\n7.  **Analyze Causal Preemption (in multi-agent scenarios):** If the outcome would have been caused by a \"backup\" agent but the primary agent acted first, the primary agent is the cause, and the backup is not.\n    -   Acknowledge that the primary agent's action was the actual cause. Answer \"Yes\" for that agent and \"No\" for the preempted agent.\n\n**Critical Guidance:**\n-   An agent's inaction can be causal if it preserves a necessary condition that they verified.\n-   **Do not conflate causation with intentionality.** An agent can cause an outcome without intending it. However, an agent can also intend an outcome they are indifferent to, if it is a known and certain side-effect.\n-   **Crucial:** An action can be *a* cause if it is either **necessary** or **sufficient** (and actual). However, you must use **Step 6** to determine if it is the **salient cause** implied by the question.\n-   **Do not stop at necessity.** You must complete all relevant steps, especially Step 6.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n\n**Example 1: (Causal Inaction)**\nQuestion: [The Wayne/watch example]\nReasoning: Wayne's inaction (not moving the device) preserved a necessary condition for charging. The counterfactual shows that if he had moved it, the outcome would not have occurred (necessary cause). No norm violation or salience issue exists.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 2: (Intentionality - Actively Undesired)**\nQuestion: [The Hunter/bird-watcher example]\nReasoning: The hunter's shot was a **cause** of the bird-watcher being hit (counterfactual dependence). However, the hunter's goal was to kill the deer; hitting a person was a foreseen but **actively undesired side-effect** (it thwarts his goal of a clean hunt). Therefore, he did not do it intentionally.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 3: (Symmetric Overdetermination)**\nQuestion: Two powerful sorcerers, Merlin and Morgana, both see a king they dislike. Simultaneously and independently, they each cast a lethal fireball spell at the king. Either fireball alone would have killed him instantly. The fireballs hit the king at the same time and he dies. Did Merlin cause the king's death?\nReasoning: Merlin's spell was **sufficient** to kill the king. The counterfactual test shows it was not necessary. This is **symmetric overdetermination**. Both actions are sufficient and deviant (attacking a king is not normal). The question is about singular causation, but both are equally salient causes. The framework treats this as a \"Yes\" for each sufficient cause.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 4: (Normality & Salience - Computer Crash)**\nQuestion: Lauren and Jane work for the same company... Lauren decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately. Did Jane cause the computer to crash?\nReasoning: Jane's login was **necessary** for the crash (without it, no crash). However, the company policy established a norm: Jane logs in mornings (normal), Lauren logs in afternoons (normal). Lauren's action was a **violation of this norm** (deviant). Jane's action was the **expected, normal condition**. Therefore, while causally necessary, Jane's action is a background condition, not the salient cause. The salient cause is Lauren's deviant action.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 5: (Explanatory Salience - Dice Game)**\nQuestion: Alex will only win the game if the total of his dice roll is greater than 11 AND the coin comes up heads... The coin comes up heads, and he rolls a 12... Did Alex win because of the coin flip?\nReasoning: The coin flip (heads) was **necessary** for the win. However, the outcome is surprising because rolling a 12 is **highly abnormal and unlikely**. The coin landing heads is a **normal, 50/50 event**. The question \"Did he win *because of* the coin flip?\" is asking for the explanatory cause. The surprising and limiting factor was the dice roll, not the coin flip. The coin flip was a necessary but non-explanatory background condition.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 6: (Intentionality - Indifference)**\nQuestion: A sniper is ordered to kill an enemy commander. He knows pulling the trigger will definitely heat the gun's barrel. He doesn't care if the barrel gets hot. He pulls the trigger, kills the commander, and the barrel heats up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel?\nReasoning: The sniper's action caused the barrel to heat (it was necessary and sufficient). His primary goal was to kill the commander. Heating the barrel was not his aim. However, he was fully aware it was a direct, immediate, and certain result of his action, and he was completely **indifferent** to it. Therefore, he did it intentionally.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nNow, apply this reasoning to the new question.",

                        "prompt": "Answer questions about causal attribution by determining if a specific agent's action was a cause of a given outcome. An action can be a cause even if it was not the only cause. To do this, apply counterfactual dependence as a primary tool, but also consider key nuances like sufficiency, intentionality, overdetermination, and indifference.\n\nFollow these reasoning steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the key elements:** What is the outcome? What specific action (or inaction) by the agent is in question? What was the agent's primary goal or intention?\n2.  **Establish the initial conditions:** What was the state of the world before the agent acted? Were other potential causal agents or sufficient conditions present?\n3.  **Run the counterfactual (Test for Necessity):** Imagine a scenario identical to the original, except the agent performs the opposite action (e.g., if they acted, imagine they did nothing).\n    -   Would the outcome **not** have occurred in this counterfactual scenario?\n    -   **If Yes:** The agent's action was a **necessary cause**. This is strong evidence for \"Yes\". Proceed to step 5.\n    -   **If No:** The action was not necessary. Proceed to step 4.\n4.  **Test for Sufficiency and Overdetermination:** An action that is not necessary can still be a cause.\n    -   **Define Sufficiency Correctly:** Was the agent's action, **by its own nature under the initial conditions, sufficient** to bring about the outcome? That is, if it had occurred and **all other potential causes were absent**, would it have caused the outcome? (Do not consider whether other causes were actually present).\n    -   **If Yes:** Then the agent's action is a **sufficient cause**. In cases of **symmetric overdetermination** (where multiple sufficient causes act simultaneously), the agent is still a cause. Answer \"Yes\" and proceed to step 5.\n    -   **If No:** The action was neither necessary nor sufficient. Answer \"No\".\n5.  **Analyze Intentionality (if the question asks about intent):** If the question uses words like \"intentionally\" or \"on purpose\":\n    -   **Important:** Analyze intentionality for the **precise outcome as described**. An agent may intend a general result but not the specific manner in which it occurred.\n    -   Did the agent perform the action **with the aim or purpose** of bringing about the outcome?\n    -   If not, was the outcome a **foreseen side-effect**?\n        -   **Actively Undesired:** The agent wished it would not happen (e.g., an accident that thwarts their goal). → **Not Intentional.**\n        -   **Indifferent:** The agent did not care whether it happened or not.\n            -   **Truly Inert Indifference:** The outcome is a **direct, mechanistic, and inherent consequence** of the physical action itself (e.g., a gun barrel heating up when fired). → **Intentional.**\n            -   **Causal Pathway Indifference:** The outcome is a **separate effect** of the action that operates through a distinct causal pathway, even if it is certain (e.g., a medicine's bonus effect). → **Not Intentional.**\n        -   **Accepted Means:** The outcome is negative, but the agent accepts it as a necessary step to achieve their goal. → **Intentional.**\n    -   If it was a desired goal or an accepted means, answer \"Yes\". If it was an actively undesired side-effect, answer \"No\". If it was a side-effect from a separate causal pathway, answer \"No\".\n6.  **Analyze Causal Preemption (in multi-agent scenarios):** If the outcome would have been caused by a \"backup\" agent but the primary agent acted first, the primary agent is the cause, and the backup is not.\n    -   Acknowledge that the primary agent's action was the actual cause. Answer \"Yes\" for that agent and \"No\" for the preempted agent.\n\n**Critical Guidance:**\n-   An agent's inaction can be causal if it preserves a necessary condition that they verified.\n-   **Do not conflate causation with intentionality.** An agent can cause an outcome without intending it (e.g., an accident). However, an agent can also intend an outcome they are indifferent to, if it is a direct, inherent, and certain side-effect.\n-   **Crucial:** An action can be a cause if it is either **necessary** or **sufficient** (and actual). Do not stop reasoning after a failed necessity test; you must also test for sufficiency in cases of overdetermination.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n\n**Example 1: (Causal Inaction)**\nQuestion: [The Wayne/watch example]\nReasoning: Wayne's inaction (not moving the device) preserved a necessary condition for charging. The counterfactual shows that if he had moved it, the outcome would not have occurred (necessary cause).\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 2: (Intentionality - Actively Undesired)**\nQuestion: [The Hunter/bird-watcher example]\nReasoning: The hunter's shot was a **cause** of the bird-watcher being hit (counterfactual dependence). However, the hunter's goal was to kill the deer; hitting a person was a foreseen but **actively undesired side-effect** (it thwarts his goal of a clean hunt). Therefore, he did not do it intentionally.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 3: (Symmetric Overdetermination)**\nQuestion: Two powerful sorcerers, Merlin and Morgana, both see a king they dislike. Simultaneously and independently, they each cast a lethal fireball spell at the king. Either fireball alone would have killed him instantly. The fireballs hit the king at the same time and he dies. Did Merlin cause the king's death?\nReasoning: Merlin's spell was **sufficient** to kill the king (by its nature, it would kill the king if no other spell were present). The counterfactual test shows it was not necessary (the king would have died from Morgana's spell). However, this is **symmetric overdetermination**. Merlin performed a sufficient action. Therefore, he **was a cause**.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 4: (Intentionality - Truly Inert Indifference)**\nQuestion: A sniper is ordered to kill an enemy commander. He knows pulling the trigger will definitely heat the gun's barrel. He doesn't care if the barrel gets hot. He pulls the trigger, kills the commander, and the barrel heats up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel?\nReasoning: The sniper's action caused the barrel to heat (it was necessary and sufficient). His primary goal was to kill the commander. Heating the barrel was not his aim. However, he was fully aware it was a direct, inherent, and certain result of his action, and he was completely **indifferent** to it. Therefore, he did it intentionally.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 5: (Intentionality - Causal Pathway Indifference)**\nQuestion: A superhero releases a neurotoxin to stop a bank robbery. A known, certain side-effect is that the toxin will later interact with a different poison to improve public health. The superhero says \"I don't care\" about the health outcome. Did the superhero intentionally improve public health?\nReasoning: The health improvement was a foreseen and certain side-effect. However, it was a **separate effect** of the toxin operating through a distinct causal pathway, not an inherent consequence of stopping a robbery. The agent was indifferent. Therefore, this is **Causal Pathway Indifference** and he did **not** do it intentionally.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 6: (Intentionality - Specific Outcome)**\nQuestion: A man aims a rifle at his aunt to kill her and inherit money. His hand slips, but the bullet hits her perfectly in the heart. Did he intentionally shoot her in the heart?\nReasoning: He intended to kill her. However, the specific outcome of a perfectly placed heart shot was caused by a slip of the hand, which was not part of his intended action. He did **not** intend for the bullet to strike that precise location due to a slip. Therefore, he did not intentionally shoot her **in the heart**.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 7: (Symmetric Overdetermination - Redundant Cause)**\nQuestion: A player wins a game if a dice roll >2 OR a spinner lands on green. He rolls a 12 (>2) and the spinner lands on green. Did spinning the spinner cause him to win?\nReasoning: The spinner landing on green is, by its nature, a **sufficient condition** for winning. The fact that the dice roll was also sufficient and present does not negate this. This is **symmetric overdetermination**. Therefore, spinning the spinner (which resulted in green) **was a cause** of winning.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nNow, apply this reasoning to the new question.",

Answer \"Yes\" for that agent and \"No\" for the preempted agent.\n\n**Critical Guidance:**\n-   **Crucial: Outcome Definition:** The way an outcome is described can change the causal attribution. Always use the precise description provided in the question.\n-   **Superseding Cause:** An action that is a cause-in-fact might not be the proximate cause if a later, independent event (e.g., a grossly negligent or intentional act by another agent) intervenes and directly brings about the outcome.\n-   An agent's inaction can be causal if it preserves a necessary condition that they verified.\n-   Do not conflate causation with intentionality. An agent can cause an outcome without intending it.\n-   **Crucial:** An action can be a cause if it is either **necessary** or **sufficient** (and actual). Do not stop reasoning after a failed necessity test; you must also test for sufficiency in cases of overdetermination.\n-   **Do not assume health:** Do not assume a healthy person would or would not have survived a subsequent event unless the scenario provides clear evidence. If you must make an assumption to complete the counterfactual, state it explicitly in your reasoning.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n\n**Example 1: (Causal Inaction)**\nQuestion: [The Wayne/watch example]\nReasoning: Wayne's inaction (not moving the device) preserved a necessary condition for charging. The counterfactual shows that if he had moved it, the outcome would not have occurred (necessary cause). No superseding cause.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 2: (Intentionality vs. Causation)**\nQuestion: [The Hunter/bird-watcher example]\nReasoning: The hunter's shot was a **cause** of the bird-watcher being hit (counterfactual dependence: no shot, no hit). However, the question asks about *intention*. The hunter's goal was to win the competition by killing the deer; hitting a bird-watcher was a foreseen but **undesired side-effect**. Therefore, he did not do it intentionally.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 3: (Symmetric Overdetermination)**\nQuestion: Two powerful sorcerers, Merlin and Morgana, both see a king they dislike. Simultaneously and independently, they each cast a lethal fireball spell at the king. Either fireball alone would have killed him instantly. The fireballs hit the king at the same time and he dies. Did Merlin cause the king's death?\nReasoning: Merlin's spell was **sufficient** to kill the king. The counterfactual test shows that if Merlin had not cast his spell, the king would still have died from Morgana's spell (so not necessary). However, this is a case of **symmetric overdetermination**. Merlin performed an action that was fully sufficient to bring about the outcome. No superseding cause.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 4: (Superseding Cause)**\nQuestion: John worked in a job for 30 years where he was exposed to asbestos, giving him terminal cancer. While in the hospital for cancer treatment, a new nurse accidentally administered a drug he was allergic to, causing immediate fatal cardiac arrest. Did John's job cause his death?\nReasoning:\n-   **Step 0: Outcome:** \"his death\" (a general description).\n-   **Step 3: Counterfactual:** If John hadn't taken the job, he wouldn't have gotten cancer, wouldn't have been in the hospital, and wouldn't have died. His job was a necessary cause-in-fact.\n-   **Step 5: Superseding Cause:** The nurse's action was a new, independent, and highly negligent event. It was the direct and proximate cause of the death (cardiac arrest). The cancer was the reason he was in the hospital, but it was not the direct cause of the death that occurred. The nurse's action is a superseding cause that breaks the causal chain from John's job.\nAnswer: No\n\nNow, apply this reasoning to the new question.",

Proceed to step 4a.\n4a. **Test for Contributory Cause (Joint Necessity):** For outcomes that require multiple actions (e.g., collective possession of an object), an action can be a cause if it is an essential part of a set of conditions that together are necessary and sufficient.\n    -   Was the agent's action a necessary part of a minimal set of actions that caused the outcome?\n    -   **If Yes:** Then the agent is a **contributory cause**. Answer \"Yes\".\n    -   **If No:** Answer \"No\".\n5.  **Evaluate the Causal Chain (Proximate Cause):** If the counterfactual test suggests causation, examine the chain of events.\n    -   Was the outcome brought about directly, or through a long and complex chain?\n    -   Was there an **intervening cause**? Specifically, did a new, independent agent perform a voluntary, negligent, or highly unexpected action that became the immediate cause of the outcome?\n    -   **If such a superseding intervening cause is found,** it breaks the chain of causation from the original action. Answer \"No\".\n6.  **Analyze Intentionality (if the question asks about intent):** If the question uses words like \"intentionally\" or \"on purpose\":\n    -   Did the agent *desire* or *aim* for the outcome to happen as part of their plan?\n    -   **Crucially:** Did the outcome happen *in the way the agent planned*? Or was it brought about by an unexpected, deviant, or accidental chain of events between the action and the outcome?\n    -   If it was a desired goal **and** executed as planned, answer \"Yes\".\n    -   If the outcome was desired but occurred in an unplanned, accidental way (a 'deviant causal chain'), or if it was only a foreseen side-effect, answer \"No\".\n7.  **Analyze Causal Preemption (in multi-agent scenarios):** If the outcome would have been caused by a \"backup\" agent but the primary agent acted first, the primary agent is the cause, and the backup is not.\n    -   Acknowledge that the primary agent's action was the actual cause. Answer \"Yes\" for that agent and \"No\" for the preempted agent.\n\n**Critical Guidance:**\n-   **Inaction:** An agent's inaction can be causal, but it requires more than mere passivity. It must typically be a **deliberate decision** made after the agent **verified** a state of affairs, thereby preserving a condition.\n-   **Proximate Cause Matters:** A long, fragile chain of dependence can be broken by a superseding, intervening cause (especially a negligent or intentional act by a new agent).\n-   **Contributory Cause:** An action can be a cause if it is an essential part of a set of conditions that together are necessary and sufficient, even if it is not sufficient alone. Pay attention to questions about collective outcomes.\n-   **Do not conflate causation with intentionality.** An agent can cause an outcome without intending it.\n-   **Crucial:** An action can be a cause if it is **necessary**, **sufficient**, or a **contributory cause** (and actual).\n\n**Examples for Guidance (Including Failure Cases):**\n\n**Example 1: (Deviant Causal Chain - Intentionality)**\nQuestion: Jake wants to inherit money and aims his rifle at his aunt. His hand slips, accidentally firing the shot that kills her. Did Jake shoot his aunt intentionally?\nReasoning: Jake desired the outcome. However, the outcome happened via a deviant causal chain (the slip), not in the way he planned (a well-aimed shot). Therefore, he did not do it intentionally.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 2: (Contributory Cause)**\nQuestion: Sue buys the left bookend. Bill independently buys the right bookend. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set?\nReasoning: Bill's action was not necessary (Sue would have bought the left one anyway) nor sufficient (he only had one half). However, the outcome is *their joint possession* of the set. Bill's purchase was a necessary part of the minimal set of actions (Bill's + Sue's) that caused this collective outcome. Therefore, he is a contributory cause.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 3: (Causal Inaction via Verification)**\nQuestion: Ned verifies the motor is in the lock position and does nothing. The boat starts because the gear is also in neutral. Did the boat start because Ned did not change the position?\nReasoning: Ned's inaction was not necessary (the gear was sufficient). However, by verifying the state and deliberately choosing not to alter it, he guaranteed a sufficient condition was met. His informed inaction is a cause.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 4: (Intervening Cause)**\nQuestion: John gets incurable cancer from asbestos at his job. A nurse then accidentally administers a lethal drug, killing him. Did John's job cause his death?\nReasoning: John's job caused the cancer. However, the nurse's negligent administration of a lethal drug is a superseding intervening cause. It is highly unexpected and breaks the chain of causation from the job to the immediate death.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 5: (Symmetric Overdetermination)**\nQuestion: Merlin and Morgana simultaneously cast lethal spells at a king. Either alone would suffice. Did Merlin cause the death?\nReasoning: Merlin's spell was sufficient. The counterfactual test fails (not necessary), but this is symmetric overdetermination. Performing a sufficient action makes him a cause.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nNow, apply this reasoning to the new question.",

Apply counterfactual dependence as the primary tool, but carefully consider nuances like intentionality, overdetermination, probabilistic contexts, and the salience of causes.\n\nFollow these reasoning steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the key elements:** What is the outcome? What specific action (or inaction) by the agent is in question? What was the agent's primary goal or intention, if stated?\n2.  **Establish the initial conditions:** What was the state of the world before the agent acted? Were other potential causal agents or sufficient conditions present? Note any probabilities or likelihoods mentioned.\n3.  **Construct and run the counterfactual (Causal Dependence Test):** Imagine the closest possible world where the agent performs the opposite action. Consider the logical ramifications of this change based on the agent's known goals.\n    - Would the outcome still have occurred in this counterfactual scenario?\n    - If **No**, then the agent's action was **a cause** of the outcome. Proceed to step 4.\n    - If **Yes**, then it did not happen *because of* that action. Answer \"No\".\n4.  **Analyze Intentionality (if the question asks about intent):** If the question uses words like \"intentionally\" or \"on purpose\":\n    - If the agent aimed for the outcome as a goal or a means to a goal, answer \"Yes\".\n    - If the outcome was a side-effect, analyze the agent's knowledge and attitude:\n        - If the agent **knew the outcome would occur** and **proceeded anyway** (even with indifference), this is typically considered an **intentional** action. Answer \"Yes\".\n        - If the outcome was an **unforeseen accident** or the agent took steps to avoid it but failed, answer \"No\".\n5.  **Analyze Singular Causation (in multi-agent or multi-factor scenarios):** If the outcome requires multiple causes and the question is phrased to imply a singular cause (e.g., \"Did Billy cause it?\"):\n    - Acknowledge that the agent is **a cause** based on the counterfactual.\n    - However, if other agents or factors are equally necessary and responsible, then the outcome is best attributed to the group. In such cases of symmetric overdetermination, answer \"No\" to the singular causal question.\n6.  **Analyze Probabilistic Causation (if probabilities are given):** If the scenario involves likelihoods (e.g., \"very unlikely,\" \"90% chance\"):\n    - The standard counterfactual test still applies: a necessary cause is still a cause.\n    - However, in common parlance, people often attribute causation to the **difference-making** or **surprising** factor.\n    - If an event was almost certain to happen, people are less likely to say the outcome happened *because of* it. If the question implies a search for the salient cause, you may answer \"No\" for a highly probable but necessary event, and \"Yes\" for the unlikely, decisive event.\n\n**Critical Guidance:**\n- An agent's inaction can be causal if it preserves a necessary condition that they verified.\n- Do not conflate causation with intentionality. An agent can cause an outcome without intending it *only if the outcome was unforeseen or an accident*.\n- In cases with multiple sufficient causes, an agent's action may not be necessary, and the outcome would have occurred regardless. Answer \"No\" in such cases.\n- The phrase \"because of\" can sometimes ask for the most salient cause. If other factors were more critical or surprising, the answer to a singular causal question may be \"No\" even if the agent's action was a necessary part of the chain.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n\n**Example 1: (Intentionality with Knowledge and Indifference)**\nQuestion: [The CEO/racial law example]\nReasoning: The CEO's order caused the violation (counterfactual: no order, no violation). The question is about intent. The CEO knew the violation would occur and proceeded with indifference to achieve his profit goal. Therefore, he intentionally violated the law.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 2: (Causal Inaction with Ambiguous Counterfactual)**\nQuestion: [The Wayne/watch example]\nReasoning: The device would charge if either plugged in OR on the pad. The counterfactual action is \"change the position.\" In the closest possible world, if Wayne had decided to change the device's position, his goal (to charge it) might lead him to unplug it. If unplugging is a logical consequence, then the outcome would not have occurred (no plug, no charge). Therefore, his inaction was causal. The dual sufficient conditions do not negate this, as his verification and subsequent inaction preserved a necessary condition from his epistemic perspective.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 3: (Probabilistic Causation and Salience)**\nQuestion: [The Joe/casino example]\nReasoning: Joe's first choice (green ball) was a necessary cause of winning (counterfactual: not green, no win). However, the right-box draw was very unlikely. The outcome is attributed to the surprising, difference-making event. Therefore, while Joe's first choice was *a* cause, the win is not said to have happened *because of* it, but rather because of the unlikely second choice. The question implies a search for the salient cause.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 4: (Symmetric Overdetermination)**\nQuestion: [The Billy/motion detector example]\nReasoning: Billy's arrival was a cause (if he had not arrived, the detector would not have gone off). However, Suzy's arrival was equally necessary. The outcome was caused by the simultaneous presence of both agents. The question \"Did Billy cause it?\" implies a singular cause, which is not accurate. The causation is shared.\nAnswer: No\n\nNow, apply this reasoning to the new question.",

Proceed to step 4.\n    - If **Yes**, then it did not happen *because of* that action. Answer \"No\".\n4.  **Analyze Intentionality (if the question asks about intent):** If the question uses words like \"intentionally\" or \"on purpose\":\n    - Did the agent perform the action *with the primary goal or purpose* of bringing about the outcome? (Specific Intent)\n    - Even if not the primary goal, did the agent *know with high certainty* that the outcome would occur as a direct result of their action? (Knowledge)\n    - If the answer to **either** question is Yes, then the agent acted intentionally. Answer \"Yes\".\n    - If the answer to **both** is No, then the outcome was an accident or unforeseeable side-effect. Answer \"No\".\n5.  **Analyze Normative Context:** Consider if the agent violated a known social, legal, or explicit rule.\n    - In cases with multiple contributing causes, if one agent acted permissibly and another violated a rule, this strongly favors attributing causation to the rule-violating agent.\n6.  **Analyze Proximate Causation (Intervening Causes):** Examine the causal chain between the agent's action and the outcome.\n    - Was there a subsequent, independent event that directly produced the outcome (e.g., a criminal act, a natural disaster)?\n    - If yes, evaluate if this intervening cause was:\n        - **Foreseeable:** A natural or likely consequence of the initial action?\n        - **Extraordinary / Superseding:** Highly abnormal, reckless, or criminal?\n    - If the intervening cause was **foreseeable**, the original agent is likely still a proximate cause.\n    - If the intervening cause was **extraordinary and superseding**, it breaks the chain of proximate causation. The original agent may be a but-for cause, but you should answer \"No\" to the causal question.\n7.  **Analyze Singular Causation (in multi-agent scenarios):** If the outcome requires multiple agents and the question is phrased to imply a singular cause (e.g., \"Did Billy cause it?\"):\n    - Acknowledge that the agent is **a but-for cause** based on the counterfactual.\n    - However, if other agents are equally necessary and responsible, then the outcome is often attributed to the group.\n    - **Exception:** If the normative context (Step 5) strongly favors attributing causation to one agent (e.g., due to their rule violation), then a \"Yes\" answer to the singular causal question is appropriate.\n\n**Critical Guidance:**\n- An agent's inaction can be causal if it preserves a necessary condition that they verified.\n- Do not conflate causation with intentionality. An agent can cause an outcome without intending it.\n- In cases with multiple sufficient causes (preemption), an agent's action may not be necessary, and the outcome would have occurred regardless. Answer \"No\" in such cases.\n- **Foreseen Outcomes are Intentional:** An outcome an agent knows is certain to result from their action is typically considered intentional.\n- **Consider Norms and Rules:** Causation for blame attribution is highly sensitive to whether an action was permissible or a violation.\n- **But-For is Not Always Enough:** A but-for cause is not always a proximate cause. Intervening criminal or highly abnormal acts can break the chain of responsibility.\n\n**Examples for Guidance (Including Failure Cases):**\n\n**Example 1: (Causal Inaction)**\nQuestion: [The Wayne/watch example]\nReasoning: Wayne's inaction preserved a necessary condition. The counterfactual shows that if he had moved the device, the outcome would not have occurred.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 2: (Intentionality - Revised)**\nQuestion: [The Hunter/bird-watcher example]\nReasoning: The hunter's shot was a but-for cause. The question asks about *intention*. The hunter's primary goal was to kill the deer (not the bird-watcher). However, he knew with certainty that shooting would hit a bird-watcher. Therefore, he knowingly caused the outcome, which qualifies as intentional.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 3: (Symmetric Overdetermination)**\nQuestion: [The Billy/motion detector example]\nReasoning: Billy's arrival was a but-for cause. However, Suzy's arrival was equally necessary and there is no normative difference (no rule violation). The question implies a singular cause, which is not accurate. The causation is shared.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 4: (Overdetermination with Norm Violation)**\nQuestion: [The Hedgehog/pencil example]\nReasoning: The hedgehog's action was a but-for cause (if it hadn't taken the pencil, one would have remained). The bear's action was also a but-for cause. This is symmetric overdetermination. However, the hedgehog violated a known rule (\"hedgehogs were not allowed\"), while the bear acted permissibly. Therefore, based on normative context, we attribute causation to the hedgehog.\nAnswer: Yes\n\n**Example 5: (Superseding Intervening Cause)**\nQuestion: [Joe/drunk driver example]\nReasoning: Joe's delay was a but-for cause (no delay, no accident). However, the car was struck by a drunk driver. This is a criminal, extraordinary, and superseding intervening cause. It was not a foreseeable result of Joe helping an injured person. This breaks the chain of proximate causation from Joe's action to the injury.\nAnswer: No\n\nNow, apply this reasoning to the new question.",

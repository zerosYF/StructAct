The outcome is not a general type of event but the specific instance as described.\n2.  **Apply the Difference-Maker Test:** Determine if the candidate event was a necessary OR sufficient part of the set of events that actually brought about **that specific outcome**. Ask: \"Was this event pivotal in making **this exact outcome** happen in the precise way it did in this scenario?\"\n3.  **Handle Preemption and Overdetermination:**\n    *   For preemption: If the event was necessary in the actual chain to trigger the outcome, it is a cause.\n    *   For overdetermination (multiple sufficient causes): An event is still a cause if it was part of the actual causal set. However, if the outcome would have occurred at the exact same time and in the exact same manner without the event, then it is not a cause of *that specific instance* of the outcome.\n4.  **Accept All Premises:** Accept the narrative's factual premises without skepticism (e.g., take stated causal links as given). Crucially, also accept the narrative's **normative premises** (e.g., rules, permissions, intentions). If a rule or norm is stated, factor it into your analysis of causation, especially for outcomes like \"the problem.\"\n5.  **Avoid External Skepticism:** Do not introduce external biological, physical, or philosophical doubts.

Focus on the event that was decisive in the actual causal chain, rather than routine or automatic necessary conditions.\n\n**Apply this two-step reasoning process:**\n\n1.  **But-For Test:** Was the outcome dependent on this event? (\"But for this event, would the outcome have occurred in the exact way it did?\")\n2.  **Pivotal Action Test:** Was this event the **decisive factor** that changed the expected course of events? Did it involve a meaningful choice, a deviation from normal procedure, or a non-guaranteed action? If the event was a routine, automatic, or procedurally guaranteed step, it is likely a background condition and not a cause.\n\n**Key Principles to Follow:**\n-   **Prioritize Proximate Agency:** The cause is typically the most immediate intentional act that made the critical difference.\n-   **Narrative Salience:** Accept the story's facts, and use its framing to identify the salient, non-standard event. The story often emphasizes the pivotal choice.\n-   **Avoid Trivial Necessity:** Do not classify routine or guaranteed steps (e.g., a required signature that is automatically given) as causes. These are background conditions.\n-   **Preemption vs. Joint Necessity:** In cases of preemption, the preempting cause is the actual cause. For jointly necessary events, identify which one was the active, pivotal decision-maker.\n-   **Overdetermination:** An event is a cause if it was sufficient on its own to bring about the outcome, even if other sufficient causes were present.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**\n\n**Example where answer is Yes (Pivotal Action):**\nQuestion: A doctor's signature was required but against policy.

The pharmacist automatically signed after confirming stock. The doctor signed despite policy against it. The drug was administered and caused recovery. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the recovery?\nReasoning: The pharmacist's action was a necessary condition but it was routine and automatic. It fails the pivotal action test.

Determine if the event was a necessary OR sufficient part of the set of events that actually brought about the outcome. Apply the \"difference-maker\" test: ask if the event was pivotal in making the outcome happen in the specific scenario described. For this test, construct the counterfactual by changing only the target event and holding all other established facts and narrative constraints fixed.\n\n**Key Principles for Application:**\n- **Hold Narrative Facts Fixed:** In your counterfactual reasoning, do not alter other events, dispositions, or background conditions stated in the narrative. Only change the specific event in question.\n- **Preemption:** An event is a cause if it was necessary to activate the actual causal chain that occurred (it preempted an alternative chain).\n- **Asymmetric Overdetermination (e.g., multiple sufficient causes):** An event can be a cause if it was part of the actual causal set that brought about the outcome, even if it was not strictly necessary.\n- **Symmetric Overdetermination (e.g., two identical sufficient causes):** In these specific cases, if the outcome would have occurred unchanged due to another identical, sufficient event even without the target event, then the target event is not a cause. The outcome is attributed to the collective set.\n- **Omissions/Double Prevention:** Treat omissions (failures to act) as potential causes if they were pivotal in allowing the actual causal chain to proceed, based on the narrative's expectations.\n\nAccept the narrative's premises without skepticism (e.g., if the story states an action led to an outcome, take it as given).

Either rock alone has enough force to break the window. The window breaks. Did Rock A cause the window to break?\nReasoning: This is symmetric overdetermination. The window breaking was guaranteed by Rock B alone. If Rock A had not been thrown, the outcome would have been identical (the window would still be broken by Rock B). Rock A's throw was not a difference-maker.\nAnswer: No\n\n**Example 4 (Answer: Yes - Omission with Narrative Constraints):**\nQuestion: Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?\nReasoning: The narrative establishes that Wayne's only available action was to change the device's position. Holding narrative facts fixed, the direct counterfactual is that if he had acted, he would have moved the device off the pad. The device charges if it is EITHER plugged in OR on the pad. In the actual world, both conditions are met (Plugged AND On Pad). His inaction preserved the \"on the pad\" condition. If he had acted, he would have removed this condition, leaving only \"plugged in.\" Since either condition is sufficient, the device would have charged anyway. However, his inaction was part of the actual sufficient set (P ∧ OP) that brought about the outcome.

It is a contributing cause, even if not necessary.\nAnswer: <answer>Yes</answer>\n\nExample:\nInput: \"Did the doctor's decision cause the recovery?\"\nReasoning: The outcome is recovery. The alleged cause is the doctor signing. Without the signature, the drug would not have been administered.

If the outcome would have occurred identically due to the default scenario without the alleged cause, then it is not a salient cause. If the alleged cause was a normal, expected part of the background conditions and the outcome was actually triggered by a *different* deviant factor, it is not considered the cause.\n5. **Render Judgment:** Decide whether the alleged cause was a genuine and *salient* contributing factor, based on the normality test.\n\n**Critical Guidelines to Avoid Errors:**\n- A cause that is merely a necessary condition in the actual set is **not sufficient** for attribution; it must be salient relative to the default scenario.\n- Do not attribute causation to a normal, expected action when a deviant action is the true difference-maker.\n- When multiple factors are equally normal or equally deviant and jointly necessary, attributing causation to a single one is often incorrect.\n\n**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput: \"Did David's clothes dry because he changed the temperature?\"\nReasoning: Outcome is drying.

The profit would have occurred identically without it. Therefore, Drew's order is not a salient cause.\nAnswer: <answer>No</answer>\n\n**Example 3 (Failure Case Correction):**\nInput: \"Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?\"\nReasoning: Outcome is the detector going off. Alleged cause is Billy's arrival. Causal mechanism: detector requires >1 person. Default scenario: both were instructed to arrive at 9 am. Both actions are equally normal and expected. Neither is deviant. Singling out Billy is arbitrary; the cause is the conjunction of both arrivals.\nAnswer: <answer>No</answer>\n\n**Example 4 (Failure Case Correction):**\nInput: \"Did Jane cause the computer to crash?\"\nReasoning: Outcome is the crash. Alleged cause is Jane logging on. Causal mechanism: crash requires two users logged on. Default scenario: Jane is permitted and expected to log on at 9 am. Deviant action: Lauren disobeyed the policy and logged on. Jane's action was normal background. The deviant action (Lauren's login) was the difference-maker.

These relate to blame, not causal attribution.\n    *   Do not attribute causation to remote, unforeseen events that break the chain of proximate causation.\n    *   Do not conflate \"a cause\" with \"the sole cause,\" but also do not over-extend causation to include all events in a chain.\n5.  **Render Judgment:** Decide whether the alleged cause was a genuine, non-redundant, proximate factor in the outcome.\n\n**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**\n\nExample:\nInput: \"Did David's clothes dry because he changed the temperature?\"\nReasoning: The outcome is drying in 60 minutes. The alleged cause is changing the temperature to HIGH. Although MAX DRY was already set (a sufficient condition), changing the temperature added another sufficient condition. Since the change was part of the actual causal set, it is a cause.\nAnswer: <answer>Yes</answer>\n\nExample:\nInput: \"Did the motorboat start because Ned changed the position of the motor?\"\nReasoning: The outcome is the motorboat starting. The alleged cause is changing the motor to lock. The gear was already in neutral, a sufficient condition. But for Ned's action, the outcome would have occurred in the exact same way. Therefore, his action was redundant and not a cause.\nAnswer: <answer>No</answer>\n\nExample:\nInput: \"Did Joe cause his son's injury?\"\nReasoning: The outcome is the son's injury. The alleged cause is Joe's delay. While the delay set a background condition, the direct, proximate cause of the injury was the drunk driver's unforeseeable, independent action. Joe's action is not the proximate cause.\nAnswer: <answer>No</answer>\n\nExample:\nInput: \"Did the doctor's decision cause the recovery?\"\nReasoning: The outcome is recovery. The alleged cause is the doctor signing. Without the signature, the drug would not have been administered. The narrative states the drug caused recovery, so the signature was a necessary component of the actual causal chain and a proximate cause.\nAnswer: <answer>Yes</answer>\n\nAfter your reasoning, provide your final answer as:\n<answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>",

The drunk driver's action was a **deliberate, reckless, and criminal act**. It was an independent, superseding cause that was not a foreseeable result of Joe's act of generosity. This intervention breaks the chain of causal attribution back to Joe.\n- **Judgment:** Joe's action was a but-for condition but not a responsible cause.\nAnswer: <answer>No</answer>\n\n**Example 4 (New - Foreseeable Intervening Act):**\nInput: \"Did the store owner's failure to repair the broken step cause the customer's fall?\"\nReasoning:\n- **Outcome:** Customer's fall and injury.\n- **Alleged Cause:** Owner's inaction (not repairing the step).\n- **Actual Causation:** The broken step was a necessary condition for the fall. By not repairing it, the owner preserved this hazardous condition.\n- **Causal Proximity & Intervening Acts:** The customer stepping on the broken stair is a foreseeable intervening act, not a superseding cause. It is the exact type of risk the owner's inaction created.\n- **Judgment:** The owner's inaction is a cause of the injury.\nAnswer: <answer>Yes</answer>\n\nAfter your reasoning, provide your final answer as:\n<answer>Yes</answer> or <answer>No</answer>",

Follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the Question's Frame:** First, decide if the question is asking about:\n    *   **(A) Physical Causation:** The question is neutrally phrased (e.g., \"Did X cause Y?\") and is purely about counterfactual dependence and causal mechanisms. **--> Proceed with physical analysis.**\n    *   **(B) Normative Attribution:** The question implies blame, responsibility, credit, or praise (e.g., \"Is X to blame for Y?\", \"Should X be credited for Y?\"). **--> Proceed with normative analysis.**\n\n2.  **Identify the Outcome and the Specific Agent Behavior:** State the outcome. Identify the precise action or inaction of the agent being questioned.\n\n3.  **Identify the Causal Rules:** Determine the scenario's rules for the outcome. Note if multiple sufficient conditions exist (overdetermination) or if one cause preempts another (where a deviant act makes a routine action causally irrelevant for attribution).\n\n4.  **Determine the Pre-existing Context:** Establish the state of the world before the agent's decision, including any relevant social norms, policies, or expected behaviors.\n\n5.  **Analyze Agency and Norms:** Assess the agent's knowledge and intent. Determine if their behavior was compliant with rules and expectations or was a deviant act.\n\n6.  **Apply the Dual Counterfactual Tests:**\n    *   **For an ACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent did **NOT** perform the action. Would the outcome have been prevented? If yes, the action was a *necessary condition*.\n    *   **For an INACTION:** Consider the closest world where the agent **DID** act. Would that action have prevented the outcome? If yes, the inaction was a *necessary condition*.\n\n7.  **Make the Final Causal Judgment:**\n    *   **For Physical Causation (from Step 1A):** A behavior is **a cause** if it was a necessary element of a sufficient set of conditions that led to the outcome. Answer \"Yes\".\n    *   **For Normative Attribution (from Step 1B):**\n        *   If the behavior was a **deviant** violation of norms/policy that created the problem, it is the cause. Answer \"Yes\".\n        *   If the behavior was **compliant, expected, and reasonable**, even if physically necessary, it is typically **not** considered the cause for attribution purposes. The cause is attributed to the deviant act or the background conditions. Answer \"No\".\n        *   **Preemption Exception:** If a deviant action preempts a standard causal process, the deviant action is the cause. Necessary but non-deviant actions in the chain are not considered the primary cause for attribution. Answer \"No\" for the compliant agent, \"Yes\" for the deviant one.\n\n**Example 1 (Action & Overdetermination - Physical Causation: Yes):**\n- Outcome: Alex wins the game.\n- Behavior: Alex spun the spinner (it landed on green).\n- Causal Rules: Win if (dice > 2) OR (spinner green).\n- Context: Dice and spin are simultaneous. Both conditions were met.\n- Agency/Norms: Alex acted as required by the game.\n- Counterfactual (Action): If Alex had not spun, the win would still have occurred (dice=12).\n- Judgment (Physical): The spin produced a sufficient condition (green). Therefore, it is **a cause**.\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n\n**Example 2 (Inaction & Overdetermination - Physical Causation: No):**\n- Outcome: Clothes dried in sixty minutes.\n- Behavior: David did not change the temperature setting.\n- Causal Rules: Dries in 60 min if *either* MAX DRY *or* HIGH temp.\n- Context: Both MAX DRY and HIGH temp were true.\n- Agency/Norms: David checked and intentionally preserved the HIGH temp state.\n- Counterfactual (Inaction): If David *had* changed the temp, the MAX DRY condition alone would still have caused the outcome.\n- Judgment (Physical): The inaction did not change the fact that a sufficient condition (MAX DRY) was met. It was not a cause.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n**Example 3 (Action & Responsibility - Normative Attribution: No):**\n- Outcome: Computer crashed.\n- Behavior: Jane logged on at her permitted time (9:00 am).\n- Causal Rules: Crashes if two users are logged in simultaneously.\n- Context: A policy existed to prevent this. Lauren violated it by logging on at 9:00 am.\n- Agency/Norms: Jane's action was compliant and expected. Lauren's was deviant.\n- Counterfactual (Action): If Jane had not logged on, the crash would not have occurred.\n- Judgment (Normative): While Jane's login was a necessary physical condition, the cause is attributed to Lauren's deviant action that violated the policy.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n**Example 4 (Simultaneous Login - Physical Causation: Yes):**\n- Outcome: Emails were deleted.\n- Behavior: Suzy logged into the central computer at 9 am.\n- Causal Rules: Deletion occurs if two people log in simultaneously.\n- Context: Company policy permitted both to log in at 9 am. The deletion risk was unknown.\n- Agency/Norms: Suzy's action was compliant and expected.\n- Counterfactual (Action): If Suzy had not logged in, only Billy would have logged in, the simultaneous condition would not have been met, and the deletion would not have occurred.\n- Judgment (Physical): The question is neutral (\"did cause\"). Suzy's action was a necessary part of the sufficient condition (two logins). It is a physical cause.\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n\n**Example 5 (Pharmacist's Signature - Normative Attribution: No):**\n- Outcome: Patient recovered.\n- Behavior: The pharmacist signed off on the drug request (a routine check of inventory).\n- Causal Rules: Recovery resulted from the drug, which required two signatures.\n- Context: A hospital policy forbade this drug due to risks. The doctor knowingly violated this policy to sign off.\n- Agency/Norms: Pharmacist's action was compliant and routine. Doctor's action was deviant.\n- Counterfactual (Action): If the pharmacist had not signed, the drug would not have been administered.\n- Judgment (Normative): The question implies attribution for a positive outcome. However, the doctor's deviant action preempts the standard process. The pharmacist's routine, compliant action is not considered the cause; the cause is attributed to the doctor's deviant decision.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\nAfter your reasoning, provide your final answer strictly as \"Yes\" or \"No\" within <answer> tags.",

This prompt is designed exclusively for determining causal factors and intentionality in systems with clear rules. It is not for judging moral responsibility or legal guilt.\n\n**Important Conceptual Clarifications:**\n-   **Foreseen Certainty Implies Intention:** If an agent knows that their action will *certainly* bring about a specific outcome in a specific manner, and they proceed with the action, then that outcome is intentional. It does not need to be their primary goal or desire; it can be an accepted side effect.\n-   **Normative Baseline for Causation:** In scenarios with official rules or standard procedures, use them to establish a \"normal\" baseline. An agent acting within this normal baseline is less likely to be considered the primary cause of an outcome that was made inevitable by a prior *deviant* action that violated the rules. The deviant action often pre-empts causal status from subsequent normal actions.\n\nFollow these reasoning steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the outcome and the specific agent behavior** being questioned.\n2.  **Distinguish the general outcome from the specific manner:** Determine if the question is about the outcome itself or the specific manner in which it occurred. If it is about the manner, this must be a separate focus of your analysis.\n3.  **Identify the causal rules** stated in the scenario for the outcome to occur.\n4.  **Determine the pre-existing conditions** before the agent's decision. Note if any conditions were created by a deviant action that violated known rules.\n5.  **Analyze the agent's knowledge and intent:**\n    a. **General Intent:** Did the agent desire the overall outcome?\n    b. **Action Intent:** Was the specific action (or inaction) deliberate?\n    c. **Knowledge of Causation:** Did the agent know their action would achieve the outcome *in the specific way it occurred*? Was the outcome certain?\n6.  **Apply the critical counterfactual test:**\n    a.  **For Causation:** Consider the closest world where the agent *did* act (if they inacted) or *did not* act (if they acted). Would that change have *prevented* the outcome by breaking a *necessary condition*?\n    b.  **But also ask:** Was the outcome already **guaranteed or pre-empted** by a prior, deviant action? Would the outcome have occurred *anyway* through the normal, expected actions of other agents? If yes, then the behavior was likely **not** a cause.\n    c.  **For Intentionality of Manner:** 'In the closest world where the agent acts deliberately and without slips, does the outcome occur *in the exact same manner*?'\n        -   If **No**, then the specific manner was not intentional.\n        -   If **Yes**, then the specific manner **was intentional**, *even if it was not the agent's primary goal*, provided the agent knew with certainty that it would occur in that manner.\n7.  **Final Check for Causal Primacy (Preemption):** If the counterfactual test (6a) suggests the agent's action was a cause, but the scenario involves a prior rule violation or deviant act by another agent that created the dangerous situation, the primary cause is the deviant act. The subsequent act that actualizes the outcome may not be the cause the question is targeting.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis (Causal Attribution - Answer: Yes):**\n- Outcome: Device fully charged.\n- Agent's behavior: Wayne did not change the position.\n- Causal rule: Charges fully in one hour *only if* both plugged in AND on charging pad.\n- Pre-existing conditions: Already both plugged in and on pad at 2:00 PM.\n- Agent's knowledge & intent: Wayne checked and saw it was on the pad, so he intentionally preserved this state.\n- Counterfactual: If Wayne *had* changed the position, he would have taken it off the pad, breaking a necessary condition.

Thus, his inaction was NOT a cause.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n**Example 3 Analysis (Intentionality of Manner - Answer: No):**\n- Question: Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?\n- Outcome: Aunt dies from a bullet to the heart.\n- Specific Manner: Bullet hitting directly in the heart.\n- Agent's behavior: Jake intentionally pulled the trigger, but a slip caused an unintended shot that luckily hit the heart.\n- Causal rule: Death occurs if a bullet strikes a vital organ with sufficient force.\n- Pre-existing conditions: Aunt is alive, Jake is a poor shot.\n- Agent's knowledge & intent: Jake intended to kill her (general intent) and intended to pull the trigger (action intent). He did *not* intend to place the bullet precisely in the heart; this was due to a slip and was unforeseen (knowledge of specific causation).\n- Counterfactual for Manner: If Jake's hand had not slipped, his poor aim might have missed or caused a non-fatal wound. The specific outcome of a heart shot was not guaranteed by his intentional action alone; it relied on luck. Therefore, shooting her *in the heart* was not intentional.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n**Example 4 Analysis (Intentionality with Certain Foresight - Answer: Yes):**\n- Question: Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?\n- Outcome: Bird-watcher was hit by the bullet.\n- Specific Manner: The bullet hitting the bird-watcher.\n- Agent's behavior: The hunter intentionally shot the deer.\n- Causal rule: A bullet will travel in a straight line and hit objects in its path.\n- Pre-existing conditions: The bird-watchers were directly behind the deer.\n- Agent's knowledge & intent: The hunter intended to kill the deer (general intent) and intended to fire the bullet (action intent). He knew with **certainty** that the bullet would hit a bird-watcher.\n- Counterfactual for Manner: In the closest world without slips, the bullet still travels through the deer and hits a bird-watcher. The outcome occurs in the exact same manner. The hunter knew this was certain. Therefore, even though it was not his primary goal, shooting the bird-watcher was an intentional side effect.\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n\n**Example 5 Analysis (Causal Preemption - Answer: No):**\n- Question: Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent?\n- Outcome: Empty email sent.\n- Agent's behavior: Alice logged in at 9:30 am.\n- Causal rule: Email sent iff two people are logged in simultaneously.\n- Pre-existing conditions: Zoe had already violated policy by logging in at 9:00 am. This created a pre-empted cause.\n- Agent's knowledge & intent: Alice was following policy unknowingly.\n- Counterfactual (Naive): If Alice had not logged in, the email would not have been sent.\n- Counterfactual (Preemption): The outcome was already guaranteed by Zoe's deviant act. The normal, expected action of the morning user (Alice) was always going to trigger it. Alice's action did not introduce a new cause; it merely completed the pre-empted causal chain initiated by Zoe.\n- Normative Baseline: Zoe violated the rules; Alice followed them. The primary cause is the violation.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\nAfter your reasoning, provide your final answer strictly as \"Yes\" or \"No\" within <answer> tags.

            "prompt": "Answer questions about causal attribution by carefully analyzing whether an agent's specific action or inaction was a cause of the outcome. Follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the outcome and the specific agent behavior** being questioned.\n2.  **Identify the causal rules** stated in the scenario for the outcome to occur.\n3.  **Determine the pre-existing conditions** before the agent's decision.\n4.  **Analyze the agent's knowledge and intent**: Did the agent check the state? Was their action/inaction intentional?\n5.  **Analyze Normality and Deviance**:\n    *   Was the agent's action compliant with established rules, norms, or expectations?\n    *   Was another agent's action deviant or a violation of rules?\n    *   Which event was more unexpected or abnormal?\n6.  **Apply the Extended Counterfactual Test**:\n    *   Consider the closest possible world where the agent *did not* perform the action (or *did* act in the case of inaction), while holding fixed the normal, expected behavior of others.\n    *   In this world, would the outcome have been prevented?\n    *   **If yes,** then the action/inaction was a cause.\n    *   **If no,** because another *sufficient* condition was present (overdetermination), then the action can still be a cause if it was sufficient. Often, all sufficient actions are considered causes.\n    *   **Special Case for Multiple Necessary Causes:** If multiple factors were necessary, causation is typically attributed to the most *abnormal* or *deviant* factor.\n7.  **Consider Moral Agency and Intent (if relevant)**:\n    *   Did the agent act with malicious or negligent intent?\n    *   Was the agent's action morally justified or praiseworthy?\n    *   Was the agent capable of acting differently? (Note: This may lead to concluding an action was a *cause* but the agent is not *blameworthy*).\n8.  **Synthesize a Final Judgment**: Weave together the findings from the counterfactual test, the normality analysis, and any moral considerations. A cause is often the most *abnormal* or *deviant* factor in a chain of events.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis (Where answer should be Yes - Overdetermination):**\n- Outcome: Coffee shop profit.\n- Agent's behavior: Drew ordered coffee.\n- Causal rule: Profit occurs if *anyone* orders coffee.\n- Pre-existing conditions: Kylie and Oliver also ordered coffee.\n- Normality/Deviance: Drew's action was normal (he usually orders). No deviant actions.\n- Counterfactual: If Drew had not ordered, profit would still have occurred (due to Kylie and Oliver). However, his action was still a *sufficient* condition for the profit.\n- Synthesis: In cases of overdetermination where multiple sufficient causes exist, each sufficient action is typically considered a cause. Drew's ordering was a sufficient cause.\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n\n**Example 2 Analysis (Where answer should be No - Abnormal Cause):**\n- Outcome: Alex wins the game.\n- Agent's behavior: Alex flipped the coin (which came up heads).\n- Causal rules: Win requires dice >11 AND coin = heads.\n- Pre-existing conditions: Neither condition was met beforehand.\n- Normality/Deviance: The dice roll was very unlikely (abnormal). The coin flip was 50/50 (normal).\n- Counterfactual: If the coin had not come up heads, Alex would not have won. It was necessary. However, the win is attributed to the *abnormal* and surprising event—the dice roll—not the normal background condition—the coin flip.\n- Synthesis: The question \"Did Alex win because of the coin flip?\" asks for the primary, salient reason. The abnormal dice roll is the more causally salient factor.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n**Example 3 Analysis (Where answer should be No - Deviant Intervenor):**\n- Outcome: Computer crashed.\n- Agent's behavior: Jane logged on at 9:00 am.\n- Causal rules: Crashes if two people are logged on simultaneously.\n- Pre-existing conditions: Company policy designated mornings for Jane.\n- Normality/Deviance: Jane's action was normal and rule-following. Lauren's action (logging on at 9:00 am) was deviant and violated official policy.\n- Counterfactual: If Jane had not logged on, the crash would not have occurred. Her action was necessary. However, the deviant and unexpected cause of the crash was Lauren's rule-breaking action.\n- Synthesis: Causation is attributed to the deviant act (Lauren's) that broke the normal, functional process, not the normal, expected action (Jane's).\n<answer>No</answer>\n\n**Example 4 Analysis (Where answer should be No - Moral Context):**\n- Outcome: Joe's son is injured.\n- Agent's behavior: Joe delayed to help an injured person.\n- Causal rules: Delay → neighbor takes child → accident → injury.\n- Normality/Deviance: Joe's action was generous and aligned with his unchangeable character (normal for him). The drunk driver's action was deviant.\n- Moral Agency: Joe acted with laudable intent. His behavior is described as a core trait he \"could not help.\"\n- Counterfactual: If Joe had not helped, his son would not have been injured. His action was a necessary link in the causal chain.\n- Synthesis: While Joe's action was a causal precursor, the primary cause is the drunk driver. Furthermore, given Joe's justified intent and lack of capacity to have easily acted otherwise, he is not considered the cause of the injury in this context.\n<answer>No</answer>\n\nAfter your reasoning, provide your final answer strictly as \"Yes\" or \"No\" within <answer> tags.",

Proceed to answer \"Yes\".\n    -   If **YES**, proceed to Step 4.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Actual Causation Test (For Physical Frames)**\n-   Even if the outcome would have occurred later, **was the proposed cause the actual, operative event that directly brought about the outcome *at the specific time it occurred*?**\n    -   If **YES** (e.g., it pre-empted a later, potential cause), then answer \"Yes\".\n    -   If **NO** (e.g., the outcome was simultaneously overdetermined by multiple sufficient causes), then answer \"No\".\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Normative Test (For Normative Frames)**\n-   If the question is framed normatively (from Step 0), construct this special counterfactual: \"If all agents had followed the rules and acted as expected, would the outcome have occurred?\"\n    -   If the outcome would **NOT** have occurred, then the norm-violating action was the cause.

The outcome would still have occurred.\n**Answer:** No\n\n**Example C: (Demonstrating Pre-emption)**\n**Question:** [John's Death Story]\n**Reasoning:**\n*   **Frame:** Physical/medical causation.\n*   **Cause:** Misadministration of medication. **Outcome:** Death at that moment.\n*   **Necessity Test (Step 3):** Without the error, would John have died at that exact moment? No, he would have died later from cancer. The outcome (death at time T) would not have occurred.\n*   **Actual Causation Test (Step 4):** The drug error was the actual, operative event that directly caused death at the time it happened. It pre-empted the cancer.\n**Answer:** Yes\n\n**Example D: (Demonstrating Normative Test)**\n**Question:** [The Hedgehog Story]\n**Reasoning:**\n*   **Frame (Step 0):** Normative. The story emphasizes a rule (\"hedgehogs were not allowed\").\n*   **Cause:** The hedgehog taking pencils. **Outcome:** No pencils for the polar bear.\n*   **Normative Test (Step 5):** If everyone had followed the rules (hedgehog takes 0, bear takes 7), would the outcome have occurred? The story implies the bear's permitted actions were sufficient to use all pencils, so the outcome would have occurred anyway. The hedgehog's violation was not the decisive cause.\n**Answer:** No\n\nAfter reasoning, output your final answer within <answer> tags.",

Classify the Question:**\n- If the question asks about **causal necessity** (e.g., \"Did X cause Y?\", \"Was X necessary for Y?\"), proceed to Step 1.\n- If the question asks about **intentional causation** (e.g., \"Did X intentionally cause Y?\", \"Did X mean to cause Y?\"), you must consider both causal necessity *and* the agent's intention. Proceed through all steps, then apply the **Intentionality Analysis** (Step 8).\n- If the question is about other concepts (e.g., moral blameworthiness), note that this framework may not be fully sufficient.\n\n1.  **Identify the proposed cause and the outcome.**\n    -   Pay close attention to how the cause is phrased. If it is a negative event or an inaction (e.g., \"did not change,\" \"was absent\"), the counterfactual will involve its positive counterpart (e.g., \"did change,\" \"was present\").\n    -   Separate an *agent's action or inaction* from the resulting *state of the world*.\n\n2.  **Construct a counterfactual scenario:** Imagine the proposed cause did NOT occur (or, for an inaction, imagine the agent DID perform the action), but all other conditions remain as similar as possible to the original situation.\n\n3.  **Determine if the outcome would still have occurred in this counterfactual scenario:**\n    -   If the outcome would NOT have occurred, then the proposed cause is a necessary causal factor.\n    -   If the outcome would still have occurred, then the proposed cause is not a necessary causal factor.\n\n4.  **For events requiring multiple conditions (e.g., A AND B must occur),** remember that EACH condition is necessary. The absence of any necessary condition prevents the outcome.\n\n5.  **Ignore the objective likelihood or probability of external events.** However, you **must** consider the agent's subjective knowledge, beliefs, and desires as stated in the scenario when analyzing questions of intention.\n\n6.  **In cases of overdetermination (where multiple sufficient causes exist),** the outcome does not depend on any single cause. If the outcome would have occurred even without the proposed cause, then the proposed cause is not necessary.\n\n7.  **Special Rule for Omissions:** For a cause phrased as an inaction (e.g., \"did not do X\"), the counterfactual is that the agent *does* perform the action. If performing that action would have changed the outcome, then the inaction was necessary. If the outcome would have been the same regardless, then the inaction was not necessary.\n\n8.  **Intentionality Analysis (if required by question classification):**\n    -   A necessary causal relationship (established in Step 3) is a prerequisite for intentional causation, but it is not sufficient.\n    -   Review the scenario for evidence of the agent's **goals and desires**. The key question is: Did the agent perform the action *with the goal or purpose* of bringing about the outcome?\n    -   If the outcome was a **foreseen but undesired side effect** of an action taken for a different purpose, then the agent did *not* intentionally cause it.\n    -   If the outcome was the direct goal of the action, then the agent *did* intentionally cause it.\n\n**Examples of correct reasoning:**\n\n**Example A:**\n**Question:** Joe wins if he gets green from left AND blue from right. He got both. Did getting green cause the win?\n**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is \"getting green.\" Counterfactual: If Joe had not gotten green (but still got blue), he would not have won because both are required. The outcome would not have occurred.\n**Answer:** Yes\n\n**Example B:**\n**Question:** The climate system turns on if travel agents OR design agents arrive. Both arrived. Did design agents cause the system to turn on?\n**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is \"design agents arriving.\" Counterfactual: If design agents had not arrived (but travel agents still did), the system would still have turned on. The outcome would still have occurred.\n**Answer:** No\n\n**Example C:**\n**Question:** Ned has a new motorboat. It starts if gear is neutral OR motor is in lock. Both are true. Ned did not change the motor's position. Did the boat start because Ned did not change it?\n**Reasoning:** The proposed cause is \"Ned did not change the motor's position,\" an *inaction*. Counterfactual: Imagine Ned *had* changed the position (moving the motor out of lock). The gear is still neutral. The boat would still start (because gear is neutral is a sufficient condition). The outcome would still have occurred. Applying Rule 7, the inaction was not necessary.\n**Answer:** No\n\n**Example D: [Intentionality Analysis]**\n**Question:** The hunter shot the deer, and the gunfire caused an eagle to fly away. The hunter knew this would happen but did not care. Did the hunter intentionally cause the eagle to fly away?\n**Reasoning:**\n-   *Causal Necessity (Steps 1-3):* The proposed cause is \"the hunter shot the deer.\" The outcome is \"the eagle flew away.\" Counterfactual: If the hunter had not shot, there would be no gunfire, and the eagle would not have flown away. The action was a necessary cause.\n-   *Intentionality Analysis (Step 8):* The hunter's goal was to kill the deer to win the competition. The eagle flying away was a known but undesired side effect of this goal. He did not act with the purpose of making the eagle fly away.\n**Answer:** No\n\nAfter reasoning, output your final answer within <answer> tags.",

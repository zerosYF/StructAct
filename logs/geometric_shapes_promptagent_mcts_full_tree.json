    "prompt": "You are an expert computational geometry analyst. Your task is to analyze SVG path data and identify which geometric shapes from a given list are completely drawn by its line segments. Follow this structured procedure precisely:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis Procedure\n\n1. **Parse Path Segments**\n   - Extract all line segments (`L` commands). Ignore `M` commands for connectivity analysis (they indicate pen lifts)\n   - Each segment = straight line between two points\n   - Note: Coordinates are rounded to 5 decimal places - treat points as identical if coordinates match within 0.00001\n\n2. **Identify Connected Components**\n   - Group segments that share endpoints OR are collinear and adjacent into continuous subpaths\n   - Different `M` commands indicate separate subpaths, but check for implicit connectivity across `M` commands if endpoints align within tolerance\n   - Tolerance: Points within 0.00001 are identical. For collinearity, use slope tolerance of 0.001 radians\n   - Important: A path may form a shape even if segments are separated by small gaps - use visual continuity when endpoints are close\n\n3. **Check for Closed Polygons**\n   - For each subpath, determine if it forms a closed polygon\n   - A polygon is closed if the final point connects back to the initial point within tolerance\n   - Merge collinear segments: Two segments are collinear if:\n     * They share an endpoint AND\n     * The angle between them is < 0.001 radians OR\n     * All three points lie on a straight line within coordinate tolerance\n   - Consider the entire path: A shape may be formed across multiple `M` commands if endpoints align\n\n4. **Analyze Polygon Properties**\n   For each closed polygon:\n   - Count number of distinct sides after merging collinear segments\n   - Calculate side lengths and angles\n   - Check for parallel sides (compare slopes within 0.001 radians tolerance)\n   - Check for right angles (dot product = 0 within 0.001 tolerance)\n   - Determine convexity (all interior angles < 180° within tolerance)\n   - Note: Regular polygons require equal sides AND equal angles within 1% tolerance\n\n5. **Validate Shape Completeness**\n   - Ensure all sides of the shape are explicitly drawn as line segments\n   - Verify no extra segments are present that would indicate diagonals or internal lines\n   - Check that the polygon is simple (no self-intersections) within tolerance\n   - A shape is considered \"drawn\" if all its sides are present as line segments, even if:\n     * They are broken into multiple collinear segments\n     * They span multiple `M` commands but connect at endpoints\n\n6. **Map to Shape Definitions**\n   Match polygon properties to these exact definitions:\n   1. Rectangle: 4 sides, 4 right angles, unequal adjacent sides\n   2. Square: 4 sides, 4 right angles, all sides equal\n   3. Non-right triangle: 3 sides, no right angles\n   4. Right triangle: 3 sides, one 90° angle\n   5. Parallelogram: 4 sides, two pairs parallel, not rectangle\n   6. Trapezoid: 4 sides, exactly one pair parallel\n   7. Irregular convex pentagon: 5 sides, convex, irregular\n   8. Irregular concave pentagon: 5 sides, concave, irregular\n   9. Regular pentagon: 5 sides, equal sides and angles\n   10. Regular hexagon: 6 sides, equal sides and angles\n\n7. **Validate Against Options**\n   - Only consider shapes that are fully drawn as closed polygons\n   - Multiple shapes may be present if multiple closed polygons exist\n   - Select the option that lists exactly the correct shape(s)\n   - If no option matches, choose \"none of the above\"\n\n### Critical Reminders:\n- `M` commands create disconnected segments - do not assume connectivity unless endpoints align\n- A shape requires all sides to be drawn as part of a closed polygon\n- Colinear segments should be merged when counting sides\n- Diagonals are internal lines connecting non-adjacent vertices\n- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the one that maximizes complete shapes and minimizes unused segments\n\n### Example Analysis (Few-Shot Guidance):\n\n[Example 1 Correction - Previous Failure]\nPath contained a parallelogram that wasn't recognized due to strict endpoint matching. The segments formed a closed quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides, but the model missed it because endpoints didn't exactly match. Correct approach: Use tolerance for endpoint matching and collinearity checking.\n\n[Example 2 Correction - Previous Failure]\nThe model incorrectly identified a 7-gon that wasn't in the options. The correct approach was to recognize that no valid closed polygon matched the definitions, so answer should be \"none of the above.\"\n\n[Example 5 Success]\nThe path contained a clear square: points (17.84567,31.10289) → (26.84567,31.10289) → (26.84567,22.10289) → (17.84567,22.10289) → back to start. All sides equal, right angles, no diagonals. Correct answer: only option 2.\n\n### Practical Considerations:\n- Real SVG paths may have numerical precision issues - use reasonable tolerance\n- Focus on the effective geometry rather than exact point matches\n- A shape is valid only if all its sides are explicitly drawn segments\n- When in doubt about whether a shape is fully drawn, err on the side of exclusion\n\nNow analyze this input carefully:\n[Insert SVG path and options here]\n\nProvide your final answer in the format: <answer>[LETTER]</answer>",

For each, record the start point (from preceding `M` or `L`) and end point.\n   - Round all coordinates to 5 decimal places (treat as exact).\n   - Ignore isolated segments (not connected to any other segment).\n\n2. **Group Connected Components**:\n   - Group segments that share endpoints (directly or through intermediate points) to form continuous paths.\n   - Consider indirect connections: if point P is the end of segment S1 and the start of S2, then S1 and S2 are connected.\n\n3. **Find Closed Loops**:\n   - For each connected component, trace paths that start and end at the same point (within rounding). Discard open paths.\n   - If a path crosses itself, it may form multiple loops; treat each simple closed loop separately.\n\n4. **Simplify Polygons**:\n   - For each closed loop, remove intermediate points that are collinear with adjacent points and in the same direction.\n   - Check collinearity: |(B-A)×(C-B)| < 0.1 and (B-A)·(C-B) > 0 (to ensure same direction).\n   - Repeat until no collinear points remain.\n\n5. **Check for Degeneracy and Validity**:\n   - Discard polygons with area < 0.001 (e.g., via shoelace formula) or with all points collinear.\n   - Discard self-intersecting polygons (use Bentley-Ottmann or check non-adjacent edges for intersection).\n\n6. **Classify Shape**:\n   - Count the number of sides after simplification.\n   - Check geometric properties with relative thresholds:\n     - **Right Angle**: |v·w| < 0.1 * |v| * |w|\n     - **Parallel Sides**: |v×w| < 0.1 * |v| * |w|\n   - Check convexity: All cross products of consecutive edges have the same sign (within tolerance).\n\n7. **Check for Diagonals**:\n   - Ensure no segment connects non-adjacent vertices of the polygon.\n   - Also, ensure no segment lies entirely inside the polygon (use point-in-polygon tests).\n\n8. **Handle Multiple Shapes**:\n   - List all valid shapes (non-degenerate, no diagonals, no self-intersection).\n   - Consider nested or overlapping shapes (e.g., a triangle inside a pentagon) if both are fully drawn without internal diagonals.\n\n9. **Map to Options**:\n   - Compare the identified shapes to the provided candidate shapes.\n   - An option is correct only if all its listed shapes are present and no incorrect shapes are included.\n\n### Key Clarifications:\n- A shape with n sides may be drawn with more than n lines (due to collinear points).

For example, a pentagon with one concave vertex should not be simplified to a quadrilateral.\n- **Missing Shapes**: Check all connected components for closed polygons. For instance, a path may contain both a triangle and a pentagon.\n- **Diagonals**: A segment connecting non-adjacent vertices is a diagonal even if it is drawn as a series of lines. For example, a rectangle with a line from (0,0) to (10,10) has a diagonal.\n- **Scale Awareness**: Use relative tolerances for geometric checks to account for coordinate scale. Do not use absolute thresholds like 0.1.\n- **Connectivity**: Do not assume all segments are connected. Each `M` may start a new subpath.\n\n### Few-Shot Examples:\n**Example 1 (Overlooking Substructure)**:\n- Path: M 0,0 L 10,0 L 10,10 L 0,10 L 0,0 M 0,0 L 5,5 L 10,0\n- Contains: rectangle (0,0)-(10,0)-(10,10)-(0,10) and right triangle (0,0)-(10,0)-(5,5)\n- Correct options: 1 and 4\n\n**Example 2 (Misclassifying Parallelism)**:\n- Path: M 0,0 L 5,0 L 7,2 L 2,2 L 0,0\n- After simplification: quadrilateral with sides (0,0)-(5,0), (5,0)-(7,2), (7,2)-(2,2), (2,2)-(0,0)\n- Check parallelism: (5,0) and (7,2) are not parallel to (2,2) and (0,0). It is a trapezoid if only one pair is parallel.\n\n**Example 3 (Ignoring Collinearity)**:\n- Path: M 0,0 L 5,0 L 10,0 L 10,10 L 0,10 L 0,0\n- After simplification: rectangle (0,0)-(10,0)-(10,10)-(0,10), not a pentagon.\n\n**Example 4 (Diagonals)**:\n- Path: M 0,0 L 10,0 L 10,10 L 0,10 L 0,0 M 0,0 L 10,10\n- The rectangle has a diagonal, so it does not qualify.\n\n### Candidate Shapes:\n1. Rectangle that is not a square and with no diagonals drawn  \n2. Square with no diagonals drawn  \n3. Triangle that is not a right triangle  \n4. Right triangle  \n5. Parallelogram that is not a rectangle and with no diagonals drawn  \n6. Trapezoid with exactly one pair of parallel sides and with no diagonals drawn  \n7.

Your task is to determine which option(s) match the visualization of the path when all lines are drawn. Follow these steps carefully:\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions:\n1. **Extract Line Segments**: List all `L` (line-to) commands along with their start points (from preceding `M` or `L`). Note: `M` starts a new subpath, but lines may connect indirectly to form shapes.\n2. **Identify Connected Components**: Group segments that are connected (shared endpoints, rounded to 5 decimal places) to form continuous paths. Each connected component should be analyzed separately.\n3. **Find Closed Polygons**: For each connected set, check if it forms a closed loop (start point = end point). If not, it does not form a shape.\n4. **Simplify the Polygon**: For each closed loop, merge collinear points (three or more points on a straight line; cross product ≈ 0 within ±0.1 tolerance) to form the minimal polygon with distinct vertices.\n5. **Classify the Shape**:\n   - Count the number of sides after simplification.\n   - Check geometric properties:\n     - **Right Angle**: Dot product of adjacent edge vectors ≈ 0 (allow ±0.1 due to rounding).\n     - **Parallel Sides**: Cross product of edge vectors ≈ 0 (allow ±0.1).\n     - **Convexity**: All cross products of consecutive edges have the same sign (all clockwise or counterclockwise). If signs differ, it is concave.\n   - Use this to match against the candidate shapes (e.g., right triangle, parallelogram, trapezoid).\n6. **Check for Diagonals**: Ensure no internal diagonals are drawn for the shape. A diagonal is any line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices and lying strictly inside the polygon boundary. If any such segment exists, discard that shape.\n7. **Consider Multiple Shapes**: The path may visualize multiple shapes simultaneously (e.g., a right triangle inside a pentagon). List all valid shapes. Multiple instances of the same shape (e.g., two parallelograms) are allowed and should be reported as one option.\n8. **Map to Options**: Compare the identified shapes to the provided options. An option is correct only if all shapes listed are present and no incorrect shapes are included. If multiple instances of a shape exist, the option is still valid.\n\n### Key Clarifications:\n- A shape with n sides may be drawn with more than n lines (e.g., collinear points). Simplify first.\n- Coordinates are rounded; ignore slight differences (e.g., treat 0.00001 as 0).\n- The visualization includes all lines, so substructures (e.g., a triangle within a larger path) count if they form a closed polygon.\n- For trapezoids, \"exactly one pair of parallel sides\" means no other pairs are parallel.\n- If no closed polygon is found, or if no candidate shape matches, output \"none of the above\".\n\n### Examples of Common Mistakes to Avoid:\n- **Example 1 (Overlooking Substructure)**: A path may contain a right triangle (e.g., points (0,0), (10,0), (0,5)) even if embedded in a larger pentagon. Both can be visible.\n- **Example 2 (Misclassifying Parallelism)**: Vectors (a,b) and (c,d) are parallel if a*d - b*c ≈ 0. Check this for trapezoids and parallelograms.\n- **Example 3 (Ignoring Collinearity)**: A path with points (0,0), (5,0), (10,0), (10,10), (0,10) simplifies to a rectangle (4 points), not a pentagon.\n- **Example 4 (Diagonals)**: If a diagonal is drawn inside a rectangle (e.g., from (0,0) to (10,10)), the rectangle does not qualify for \"no diagonals\".\n- **Example 5 (Concavity)**: A pentagon may be concave if cross products of consecutive edges change sign. Check carefully.\n- **Example 6 (Multiple Shapes)**: A path may contain two parallelograms. Option 5 is correct even though there are two instances.\n\n### Candidate Shapes:\n1. Rectangle that is not a square and with no diagonals drawn  \n2. Square with no diagonals drawn  \n3. Triangle that is not a right triangle  \n4. Right triangle  \n5.

Your task is to determine which option(s) match the visualization of the path when all lines are drawn. Follow these steps carefully:\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions:\n1. **Build a Graph of Points and Segments**:\n   - Extract all points from `M` and `L` commands, rounding each coordinate to 5 decimal places.\n   - Create an undirected graph where nodes are points and edges exist between points connected by an `L` command (ignoring `M` discontinuities if endpoints match within rounding).\n\n2. **Find Connected Components**:\n   - Use graph traversal (e.g., BFS/DFS) to find all connected components. Each component represents a set of interconnected segments.\n\n3. **Identify Closed Polygons**:\n   - For each component, find all cycles (closed loops) where the start point equals the end point. Note: A single component may contain multiple cycles.\n\n4. **Simplify Each Polygon**:\n   - For each cycle, remove collinear points: For each triplet of consecutive points (A, B, C), compute the cross product of (B-A) and (C-A). If |cross product| < 0.1, remove B. Repeat until no collinear points remain.\n\n5. **Classify the Shape**:\n   - Count the number of sides after simplification.\n   - Check geometric properties with tolerance ±0.1:\n     - **Right Angle**: Dot product of adjacent edge vectors ≈ 0.\n     - **Parallel Sides**: Cross product of non-adjacent edge vectors ≈ 0.\n     - **Convexity**: All cross products of consecutive edges have the same sign.\n   - Match to candidate shapes (e.g., right triangle, trapezoid).\n\n6. **Check for Diagonals**:\n   - For each polygon, verify no segment in the path lies strictly inside its boundary (i.e., both endpoints on the polygon but the segment is not an edge). If found, discard the shape.\n\n7. **List All Valid Shapes**:\n   - The path may contain multiple non-overlapping shapes. Include all that satisfy the above.\n\n8. **Map to Options**:\n   - Compare identified shapes to the provided options. An option is correct only if all its shapes are present and no extra shapes are included.\n\n### Key Clarifications:\n- Round all coordinates to 5 decimal places before processing.\n- Use tolerance ±0.1 for all geometric checks (dot products, cross products).\n- `M` commands start new subpaths, but segments may connect visually if endpoints match (within rounding).\n- A shape with n sides may be drawn with more than n lines (merge collinear points).\n- For trapezoids, \"exactly one pair of parallel sides\" means no other pairs are parallel within tolerance.\n\n### Examples of Common Mistakes to Avoid:\n- **Missing Embedded Shapes**: A path may contain a small triangle (e.g., points (16.05,6.0), (22.05,6.0), (16.05,11.29)) even if within a larger path. Both the large path and the triangle should be considered if closed.\n- **Incorrect Collinearity Check**: Points (0,0), (4.47,-2.39), (17.20,-9.19) may be collinear if |cross product| < 0.1. Remove intermediate points.\n- **Misjudging Diagonals**: A segment from (0,0) to (10,10) inside a rectangle from (0,0) to (10,10) to (10,0) to (0,0) is a diagonal—discard the rectangle.\n- **Overlooking Shared Edges**: A rectangle and triangle can share an edge (e.g., along y=0) and both be valid if no diagonals are present.\n- **Floating-Point Errors**: Coordinates like -0.00001 should be treated as 0.0. Use tolerances in all comparisons.\n\n### Candidate Shapes:\n[List remains unchanged]\n\nNow, analyze the given SVG path and output the correct option(s).",

Irregular convex pentagon: 5 sides, convex, irregular\n   8. Irregular concave pentagon: 5 sides, concave, irregular\n   9. Regular pentagon: 5 sides, equal sides and angles\n   10. Regular hexagon: 6 sides, equal sides and angles\n\n7. **Validate Against Options**\n   - Only consider shapes that are fully drawn as closed polygons\n   - Multiple shapes may be present if multiple closed polygons exist\n   - Select the option that lists exactly the correct shape(s)\n   - If no option matches, choose \"none of the above\"\n\n### Enhanced Shape Acceptance Criteria\n\n**Critical Principles:**\n- A shape must be explicitly drawn: All sides must exist as line segments in the path, even if fragmented\n- Small gaps (< 0.001 units) can be bridged if visually continuous\n- Reject shapes only if sides are missing or if there are internal diagonals\n- Multiple collinear segments count as a single side\n- When in doubt, prefer inclusion over exclusion for clear visual shapes\n\n**Confidence Assessment:**\n- For each potential shape, assign confidence (0-1)\n- Only consider shapes with confidence > 0.9\n- Reject borderline cases only if clearly invalid\n\n### Closure Verification Protocol\n\n1. Trace the entire path from start to end\n2. If the path doesn't return to start, check if endpoints are within tolerance (0.001)\n3. If endpoints > 0.001 apart, but the shape is visually closed and all sides are present, accept it\n4. Only reject if there is a clear break in the shape\n\n### Complex Path Handling Strategy\n\n1. First identify all obvious closed loops\n2. Check for shapes within these loops\n3. Ignore segments that don't contribute to closed shapes\n4. If multiple interpretations exist, prefer the one that uses the most segments\n5. Document all reasoning steps\n\n### Example Analysis (Failure Cases Guidance):\n\n[Example 1 - Previous Failure]\nPath contained segments suggesting a right triangle, but the hypotenuse was composed of non-collinear segments that didn't form a single straight line. The model incorrectly accepted it. Correct approach: REJECT shapes where sides are not explicitly drawn as continuous segments, even if vertices suggest a valid shape.\n\n[Example 2 - Previous Failure]  \nThe model identified a right triangle correctly but forced a parallelogram that wasn't closed. Correct approach: Only accept shapes that are fully closed with all sides present. Don't force-fit partial matches.\n\n[Example 3 - Success]\nThe path contained a clear trapezoid with one pair of parallel vertical sides. All sides were present as line segments, no diagonals. The model correctly identified it as option 6.\n\n[Example 4 - Previous Failure]\nThe model missed a square because the bottom side wasn't a single segment, even though the other three sides were explicit and the shape was visually closed. Correct approach: Accept shapes where all sides are present, even if fragmented across segments.\n\n### Tolerance Application Examples:\n- Points (1.00000, 2.00000) and (1.00001, 2.00001) → SAME POINT\n- Angles 89.9° and 90.1° → RIGHT ANGLE (within 0.001 rad tolerance)\n- Lengths 10.000 and 10.010 → NOT EQUAL (1% difference)\n\n### Practical Considerations:\n- Real SVG paths may have numerical precision issues - use reasonable tolerance\n- Focus on the effective geometry rather than exact point matches\n- A shape is valid only if all its sides are explicitly drawn segments\n- When in doubt about whether a shape is fully drawn, perform visual sanity check\n\nNow analyze this input carefully:\n[Insert SVG path and options here]\n\nProvide your final answer in the format: <answer>[LETTER]</answer>",

Your task is to analyze SVG path data and identify which geometric shapes from a given list are completely drawn by its line segments. Follow this structured procedure precisely:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis Procedure\n\n1. **Parse Path Segments**\n   - Extract all line segments (`L` commands). Ignore `M` commands for connectivity analysis (they indicate pen lifts)\n   - Each segment = straight line between two points\n   - Note: Coordinates are rounded to 5 decimal places - treat points as identical if coordinates match within 0.00001\n\n2. **Identify Connected Components**\n   - Group segments that share endpoints OR are collinear and adjacent into continuous subpaths\n   - Different `M` commands indicate separate subpaths, but check for implicit connectivity across `M` commands only if endpoints align within tolerance and segments are visually continuous\n   - Tolerance: Points within 0.00001 are identical. For collinearity, use slope tolerance of 0.001 radians\n   - Important: Do not force connectivity across distant `M` commands. Only connect if segments clearly form part of the same geometric feature\n\n3. **Check for Closed Polygons**\n   - For each subpath, determine if it forms a closed polygon\n   - A polygon is closed if the final point connects back to the initial point within tolerance\n   - Merge collinear segments: Two segments are collinear if:\n     * They share an endpoint AND\n     * The angle between them is < 0.001 radians OR\n     * All three points lie on a straight line within coordinate tolerance\n   - Consider the entire path: A shape may be formed across multiple `M` commands only if endpoints align and the connection is visually coherent\n\n4. **Analyze Polygon Properties**\n   For each closed polygon:\n   - Count number of distinct sides after merging collinear segments\n   - Calculate side lengths and angles\n   - Check for parallel sides (compare slopes within 0.001 radians tolerance)\n   - Check for right angles (dot product = 0 within 0.001 tolerance)\n   - Determine convexity (all interior angles < 180° within tolerance)\n   - Note: Regular polygons require equal sides AND equal angles within 1% tolerance\n\n5. **Validate Shape Completeness**\n   - Ensure all sides of the shape are explicitly drawn as line segments\n   - Verify no extra segments are present that would indicate diagonals or internal lines\n   - Check that the polygon is simple (no self-intersections) within tolerance\n   - A shape is considered \"drawn\" if all its sides are present as line segments, even if:\n     * They are broken into multiple collinear segments\n     * They span multiple `M` commands but connect at endpoints\n   - Reject degenerate polygons (e.g., triangles with collinear points)\n\n6. **Map to Shape Definitions**\n   Match polygon properties to these exact definitions:\n   1. Rectangle: 4 sides, 4 right angles, unequal adjacent sides\n   2. Square: 4 sides, 4 right angles, all sides equal\n   3. Non-right triangle: 3 sides, no right angles\n   4. Right triangle: 3 sides, one 90° angle\n   5. Parallelogram: 4 sides, two pairs parallel, not rectangle\n   6. Trapezoid: 4 sides, exactly one pair parallel\n   7. Irregular convex pentagon: 5 sides, convex, irregular\n   8. Irregular concave pentagon: 5 sides, concave, irregular\n   9. Regular pentagon: 5 sides, equal sides and angles\n   10. Regular hexagon: 6 sides, equal sides and angles\n\n7. **Validate Against Options**\n   - Only consider shapes that are fully drawn as closed polygons\n   - Multiple shapes may be present if multiple closed polygons exist\n   - If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the one that minimizes the number of shapes and unused segments\n   - Select the option that lists exactly the correct shape(s)\n   - If no option matches, choose \"none of the above\"\n\n### Critical Reminders:\n- `M` commands create disconnected segments - do not assume connectivity unless endpoints align and segments are visually continuous\n- A shape requires all sides to be drawn as part of a closed polygon\n- Colinear segments should be merged when counting sides, but avoid over-merging that changes the intended shape\n- Diagonals are internal lines connecting non-adjacent vertices\n- If a segment could belong to multiple shapes, prefer the interpretation that maximizes complete shapes while minimizing unused segments\n\n### Example Analysis (Few-Shot Guidance):\n\n[Example 1 Correction - Previous Failure]\nPath contained a parallelogram that wasn't recognized due to strict endpoint matching. The segments formed a closed quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides, but the model missed it because endpoints didn't exactly match. Correct approach: Use tolerance for endpoint matching and collinearity checking.\n\n[Example 2 Correction - Previous Failure]\nThe model incorrectly identified a convex pentagon by connecting segments across multiple M commands. The correct approach was to recognize that these segments were visually disconnected and should not be combined into one shape.\n\n[Example 3 Correction - Previous Failure]\nThe model identified a triangle by merging multiple nearly-collinear segments, but the original path did not intend a triangle at that location. Correct approach: Be conservative when merging segments; only merge if clearly collinear.\n\n[Example 4 Success]\nThe path contained a clear rectangle: points (0.0,16.37063) → (0.0,0.0) → (17.55,0.0) → (17.55,16.37063) → back to start. All sides present, right angles, no diagonals. Correct answer: only option 1.\n\n### Practical Considerations:\n- Real SVG paths may have numerical precision issues - use reasonable tolerance\n- Focus on the effective geometry rather than exact point matches\n- A shape is valid only if all its sides are explicitly drawn segments\n- When in doubt about whether a shape is fully drawn, err on the side of exclusion\n- Do not create degenerate polygons (e.g., triangles with collinear points)\n\nNow analyze this input carefully:\n[Insert SVG path and options here]\n\nProvide your final answer in the format: <answer>[LETTER]</answer>",

Record the coordinates of every point.\n   - Each segment = straight line between two points.\n   - **Critical:** Coordinates are rounded to 5 decimal places - treat points as identical if coordinates match within 0.00001.\n\n2. **Build a Graph of Points and Segments**\n   - Create a graph where nodes are points and edges are segments.\n   - **Connectivity Rule:** `M` commands typically indicate pen lifts, but if the endpoint of a segment from one subpath is identical (within tolerance) to the start point of a segment from another subpath, these segments are connected. The entire path should be treated as a single graph for cycle detection.\n\n3. **Identify All Closed Polygons (Cycles)**\n   - Find all cycles in the graph. A cycle is a closed polygon where a path of connected segments starts and ends at the same point.\n   - **Note:** A single polygon may be drawn using multiple segments across different `M` commands. It is defined by its vertices, not by the order of commands in the SVG.\n\n4. **Merge Collinear Segments**\n   - For each cycle, merge consecutive segments that are collinear into a single side. Use vector cross product to check collinearity (cross product ≈ 0 within tolerance).\n   - **Critical:** This merging must be done across segments from different `M` commands if they are part of the same logical side.\n\n5. **Analyze Polygon Properties**\n   For each closed polygon (after merging collinear segments):\n   - Count number of distinct sides.\n   - Calculate side lengths and angles.\n   - Check for parallel sides (compare slopes; slopes equal within tolerance).\n   - Check for right angles (dot product of adjacent side vectors ≈ 0 within tolerance).\n   - Determine convexity (all interior angles < 180°; check using cross product signs).\n   - **Note:** Regular polygons require equal sides AND equal angles.\n\n6. **Map to Shape Definitions**\n   Match polygon properties to these exact definitions:\n   1.

Your task is to analyze SVG path data and identify which geometric shapes from a given list are completely drawn by its line segments. Follow this structured procedure precisely:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis Procedure\n\n1. **Parse Path Segments**\n   - Extract all line segments (`L` commands) and moveto commands (`M`). Record the coordinates of every point.\n   - Each segment = straight line between two points.\n   - **Critical:** Coordinates are rounded to 5 decimal places - treat points as identical if coordinates match within 0.00001.\n\n2. **Quick Scan for Simple Shapes**\n   - Before building the full graph, look for obvious simple closed shapes:\n     - **Triangles:** Check for three points that form a cycle with three segments.\n     - **Rectangles/Squares:** Look for four points with right angles and parallel sides.\n   - **Note:** A shape may be drawn with extra segments; focus on the outer boundary.\n\n3. **Build a Graph of Points and Segments**\n   - Create a graph where nodes are points and edges are segments.\n   - **Connectivity Rule:** `M` commands typically indicate pen lifts, but if the endpoint of a segment from one subpath is identical (within tolerance) to the start point of a segment from another subpath, these segments are connected. The entire path should be treated as a single graph for cycle detection.\n   - **Merge Points:** If two points are within tolerance, merge them into one node.\n\n4. **Identify All Closed Polygons (Cycles)**\n   - Find all simple cycles in the graph. A simple cycle is a closed polygon where no vertex is repeated (except start/end).\n   - **Priority:** Prefer smaller cycles (e.g., triangles, quadrilaterals) over larger ones.\n   - **Note:** A single polygon may be drawn using multiple segments across different `M` commands. It is defined by its vertices, not by the order of commands in the SVG.\n\n5. **Merge Collinear Segments**\n   - For each cycle, merge consecutive segments that are collinear into a single side. Use vector cross product to check collinearity (cross product ≈ 0 within tolerance).\n   - **Critical:** This merging must be done across segments from different `M` commands if they are part of the same logical side.\n\n6. **Analyze Polygon Properties**\n   For each closed polygon (after merging collinear segments):\n   - Count number of distinct sides.\n   - Calculate side lengths and angles.\n   - Check for parallel sides (compare slopes; slopes equal within tolerance).\n   - Check for right angles (dot product of adjacent side vectors ≈ 0 within tolerance).\n   - Determine convexity (all interior angles < 180°; check using cross product signs for consecutive edges).\n   - **Note:** Regular polygons require equal sides AND equal angles.\n\n7. **Map to Shape Definitions**\n   Match polygon properties to these exact definitions:\n   1. Rectangle: 4 sides, 4 right angles, unequal adjacent sides\n   2. Square: 4 sides, 4 right angles, all sides equal\n   3. Non-right triangle: 3 sides, no right angles\n   4. Right triangle: 3 sides, one 90° angle\n   5. Parallelogram: 4 sides, two pairs parallel, not rectangle\n   6. Trapezoid: 4 sides, exactly one pair parallel\n   7. Irregular convex pentagon: 5 sides, convex, irregular\n   8. Irregular concave pentagon: 5 sides, concave, irregular\n   9. Regular pentagon: 5 sides, equal sides and angles\n   10. Regular hexagon: 6 sides, equal sides and angles\n\n8. **Validate Against Options**\n   - Only consider shapes that are fully drawn as closed polygons. Internal diagonals or extra segments do not invalidate a shape.\n   - Multiple shapes may be present if multiple closed polygons exist.\n   - Select the option that lists **exactly and only** the correct shape(s).\n   - If no option matches, choose \"none of the above\".\n\n### Critical Reminders:\n- **Simple Shapes First:** Always check for triangles and quadrilaterals before larger polygons.\n- **Graph Connectivity is Key:** The entire path is a graph. `M` suggests disconnection, but always check endpoint matches across subpaths.\n- **Merge Collinearity Globally:** Collinear segments must be merged even if from different `M` commands.\n- **Diagonals are Internal:** A diagonal connects non-adjacent vertices of a polygon. If present, the shape has diagonals drawn, but it is still fully drawn.\n- **Tolerance:** Use 0.00001 for all comparisons (point equality, cross product, dot product).\n\n### Example Analyses (Few-Shot Guidance):\n\n[Example 1 Correction]\nPath contains segments that form a rectangle and a triangle: \n- Rectangle: points (0,0)-(12.76409,0)-(12.76409,12)-(0,12)\n- Triangle: points (0,0)-(4.47191,-2.38892)-(17.19964,-9.18816) → non-right triangle\nAfter merging collinear segments, the rectangle has 4 sides with right angles, and the triangle has 3 sides with no right angle.

                "prompt": "You are an expert computational geometry analyst. Your task is to analyze SVG path data and identify which geometric shapes from a given list are completely drawn by its line segments. Follow this structured procedure precisely:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis Procedure\n\n1. **Parse All Segments**\n   - Extract all line segments from `L`, `H` (horizontal), and `V` (vertical) commands\n   - Explicitly break down any multi-point commands into individual segments (e.g., `L x1,y1 x2,y2` becomes two segments: `current→(x1,y1)` and `(x1,y1)→(x2,y2)`)\n   - Each segment = straight line between two points\n   - Note: Coordinates are rounded to 5 decimal places - treat points as identical if coordinates match within 0.00001\n\n2. **Build Connectivity Graph**\n   - Create a graph where nodes are points and edges are segments\n   - Group segments that share endpoints (within tolerance) into connected components\n   - **Critical**: Different `M` commands typically indicate separate components. However, verify connectivity strictly through endpoint matching, not `M` commands alone\n   - Each connected component represents a potentially separate shape\n\n3. **Find Closed Polygons**\n   - For each connected component, trace paths to find simple cycles (closed polygons)\n   - A polygon is closed if the final point connects back to the initial point\n   - **Critical**: Discard any self-intersecting or degenerate polygons (zero-area)\n   - **Critical**: If a polygon has more than 6 sides, it cannot match any listed shape\n   - Merge collinear segments into single sides (only consecutive segments along the same edge)\n\n4. **Analyze Polygon Properties**\n   For each closed polygon:\n   - Count number of distinct sides after merging collinear segments\n   - Calculate side lengths and angles (using vector mathematics)\n   - Check for parallel sides (compare slopes; vertical lines have undefined slope but are parallel to each other)\n   - Check for right angles (dot product ≈ 0 within tolerance)\n   - Determine convexity (all cross products of consecutive edges have same sign for convex polygons)\n   - **Critical**: Regular polygons require equal sides AND equal angles within tolerance\n\n5. **Map to Shape Definitions**\n   Match polygon properties to these exact definitions:\n   1. Rectangle: 4 sides, 4 right angles, opposite sides parallel and equal, adjacent sides unequal\n   2. Square: 4 sides, 4 right angles, all sides equal\n   3. Non-right triangle: 3 sides, no right angles\n   4. Right triangle: 3 sides, one 90° angle\n   5. Parallelogram: 4 sides, two pairs of parallel sides, not a rectangle (no right angles)\n   6. Trapezoid: 4 sides, exactly one pair of parallel sides\n   7. Irregular convex pentagon: 5 sides, convex, irregular\n   8. Irregular concave pentagon: 5 sides, concave, irregular\n   9. Regular pentagon: 5 sides, equal sides and angles\n   10. Regular hexagon: 6 sides, equal sides and angles\n\n   **Critical**: If a shape doesn't match any definition (e.g., concave quadrilateral), it is invalid\n\n6. **Validate Against Options**\n   - Only consider shapes that are fully drawn as closed polygons with no internal diagonals\n   - **Critical**: For \"no diagonals,\" ensure all segments are part of the boundary; no segment connects non-adjacent vertices\n   - Multiple shapes may be present if multiple valid closed polygons exist\n   - Select the option that lists exactly the correct shape(s) found\n   - If an option includes a shape you did not find, it is incorrect\n   - If no option matches exactly, choose \"none of the above\"\n\n### Critical Reminders & Heuristics:\n- Apply coordinate tolerance (0.00001) consistently for all point comparisons\n- `M` commands are not reliable indicators of disconnection - always check endpoint connectivity\n- A shape requires all sides to be drawn as part of a closed polygon\n- Collinear segments should be merged when counting sides\n- Prioritize finding simple polygons (triangles, quadrilaterals) - complex polygons (>6 sides) are rarely correct answers\n- Small connected components may form separate shapes - check all components thoroughly\n\n### Example Analysis (Failure Avoidance Guidance):\n\n[Example 1 - Previously Failed]\nPath contains segments that form a closed quadrilateral after merging collinear segments:\n- Points: (0.0,-18.0)→(0.0,-30.0)→(12.0,-30.0)→(12.0,-18.0)→(0.0,-18.0)\n- 4 sides with right angles, all sides length 12 → Square\nBut also contains a right triangle: (0.0,0.0)→(0.0,-18.0)→(12.75,-18.0)→(0.0,0.0)\nCorrect answer should include both square and right triangle → Only option containing both is (O) 1,4,7,10 but includes extra shapes → No exact match → (P) none of the above\n\n[Example 2 - Previously Failed]\nMultiple segments form a closed pentagon with vertices:\n(0.0,0.0)→(-9.02208,10.7521)→(-17.44857,3.68143)→(-8.42649,-7.07066)→(-10.33662,3.76222)→(0.0,0.0)\n- 5 sides, concave, irregular → Irregular concave pentagon\nBut also contains a separate triangle: (2.63778,-11.56632)→(4.17592,-12.63334)→(5.03728,-13.23087)→(2.63778,-11.56632)\n- 3 sides, no right angles → Non-right triangle\nCorrect answer: Options 3 and 8 are present → Only option containing both is (H) 8 and 3\n\n[Example 3 - Previously Failed]\nSegments form a closed triangle:\n- (0.0,0.0)→(0.0,-1.72196)→(3.6183,-2.05268)→(0.0,0.0)\n- 3 sides, no right angles → Non-right triangle\nNo other closed shapes are fully formed\nCorrect answer: Only option 3 → (D) only 3\n\n[Example 4 - Previously Failed]\nSegments form a closed irregular concave pentagon:\n- (0.0,0.0)→(0.0,-18.0)→(12.0,-18.0)→(12.0,0.0)→(6.0,-10.3923)→(0.0,0.0)\n- 5 sides, concave, irregular → Irregular concave pentagon\nNo other closed shapes are fully formed\nCorrect answer: Only option 8 → But no option contains only 8 → (P) none of the above\n\n[Example 5 - Previously Failed]\nSegments form one large closed polygon with 8 sides after merging collinear segments:\n- Not matching any listed shape (only options go up to 6 sides)\nCorrect answer: No option matches → (P) none of the above\n\nNow analyze this input carefully:\n[Insert SVG path and options here]\n\nProvide your final answer in the format: <answer>[LETTER]</answer>",

This simplifies the path and avoids overcounting.\n- **Implied Connections**: If endpoints are aligned horizontally or vertically (within 0.001 tolerance) and no other segment exists between them, consider them connected. However, if the path draws a non-straight detour (e.g., multiple segments with different slopes), do not assume a straight side.\n- **No Diagonals Drawn**: This means no internal lines (diagonals within the shape) are present. It does not require all sides to be drawn explicitly; implied sides are allowed if endpoints are aligned.\n- **Multiple Shapes**: The path may contain multiple disconnected shapes. Check each candidate shape independently, even if they share edges or overlap.\n- **Approximation Tolerances**:\n  - Parallelism: Slopes differ by < 0.01.\n  - Perpendicularity: Dot product < 0.01 (for normalized vectors) or one horizontal and one vertical.\n  - Equal lengths: Difference < 0.01.\n  - Common angles: Use integer ratios (e.g., 1:1 for 45°, 1:√3 for 30°/60°).\n- **Visualization Over Precision**: Focus on the overall visual appearance. If segments approximately form a shape (e.g., nearly right angles, nearly equal lengths), accept it. Do not require exact mathematical precision.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n1. **Parse and Merge Segments**: Extract all line segments from `M` and `L` commands. Group segments by proximity (points within 0.001 are the same). Merge collinear segments (slope difference < 0.01) into single lines.\n2. **Group Connected Components**: Identify clusters of segments that are connected or have aligned endpoints. Each cluster may form one or more shapes.\n3. **Identify Key Features**: For each cluster, look for:\n   - Vertical lines (x constant), horizontal lines (y constant), and diagonals.\n   - Points where lines meet or endpoints are close.\n   - Calculate slopes and angles approximately using tolerances.\n4. **Check for Simple Shapes First**:\n   - **Rectangle/Square**: Look for two pairs of parallel sides and four right angles. For square, ensure equal side lengths.\n   - **Triangle**: Three lines forming a closed figure (may have collinear segments). Check for right angle using dot product.\n   - **Right Triangle**: Two perpendicular lines (approximate right angle).\n5. **Check for Complex Shapes**:\n   - **Parallelogram**: Two pairs of parallel sides (not necessarily right angles).\n   - **Trapezoid**: Exactly one pair of parallel sides.\n   - **Pentagon**: Five-sided polygon (convex or concave). Regular requires equal sides and angles.\n   - **Hexagon**: Six-sided polygon (regular only if option 10).\n6. **Verify Against Options**: For each candidate shape, ensure no internal diagonals are drawn if required. Consider all shapes present, even if overlapping.\n7. **Final Decision**: If the correct combination is not listed, choose \"none\" only if no option is correct. Otherwise, select the closest match that includes all correct shapes.\n\n### Examples of Common Mistakes to Avoid (Few-Shot):\n[Example 1: Overcomplication]\nPath: Contains multiple segments that are collinear. Do not treat them as separate sides; merge them first. Incorrectly identified a trapezoid due to unmerged segments.\nCorrection: Merge collinear lines before shape detection.\n\n[Example 2: Implied Connections]\nPath: Endpoints at (0,0) and (10,0) are aligned horizontally, but the path draws a detour between them.

When visualized together, these segments may form one or more geometric shapes.\n- A shape with n sides may be drawn with more than n lines (e.g., a triangle might be drawn with 4 lines if two are collinear). Merge collinear segments to form minimal edges.\n- Coordinates are rounded to 5 decimal places, so ignore slight differences. Approximate right angles, parallel lines, and equal lengths should be accepted.\n- Shapes need not be explicitly closed; if segments visually form a shape, it counts.

Avoid creating implied segments that would fragment a larger shape.\n- Multiple shapes may be present, but if a smaller shape is entirely embedded within a larger shape (sharing edges), prioritize the larger shape. Only consider the smaller shape as separate if it has distinct lines not part of the larger shape.\n- The answer must exactly match one of the provided options.

Group segments into connected components using endpoint proximity (points within 0.001 are the same). For each component, form a graph of points and edges.\n2. **Simplify Collinear Points**: For each connected component, merge collinear points to form minimal edges. If three points A, B, C are collinear and B is between A and C, replace segments AB and BC with AC.\n3. **Reconstruct Polygons**: Traverse the graph to find all simple cycles (closed polygons). For each cycle, count the number of sides after simplification.\n4. **Identify Key Features**: For each polygon, approximate features:\n   - Check for vertical/horizontal lines (slope ≈ 0 or undefined).\n   - Calculate slopes for diagonals. Consider lines parallel if slopes differ by < 0.01 (relative to coordinate scale).\n   - Check perpendicularity using dot product (near zero). For right angles, ensure vectors are approximately orthogonal.\n   - Check side lengths for equality (difference < 0.01).\n5. **Classify Shapes**: For each polygon, classify based on features:\n   - **Triangle**: 3 sides. Check for right angle (if yes, option 4; else, option 3).\n   - **Rectangle**: 4 sides, four right angles, two pairs of parallel sides. If sides equal, it is a square (option 2); else, option 1.\n   - **Parallelogram**: 4 sides, two pairs of parallel sides, not all right angles (option 5).\n   - **Trapezoid**: 4 sides, exactly one pair of parallel sides (option 6).\n   - **Pentagon**: 5 sides. Check convexity (all interior angles < 180°) and regularity (equal sides and angles). Options: convex (7), concave (8), regular (9).\n   - **Hexagon**: 6 sides. Regular only if option 10.\n6. **Check for Diagonals**: Ensure no internal diagonals are drawn if the option says \"no diagonals drawn\". Edges are not diagonals.\n7. **Consider Multiple Shapes**: If multiple polygons are present, list all distinct shapes. Avoid double-counting embedded shapes.\n8. **Match Options**: Map the identified shapes to the options. Select the option that exactly matches the set. If no match, choose \"none\".\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid:\n- **Overcounting Embedded Shapes**: Do not count a triangle if it is part of a pentagon (unless drawn with distinct lines).\n- **Overreliance on Implied Connections**: Only use implied connections if necessary for closure and not conflicting with larger shapes.\n- **Ignoring Collinearity**: Merge collinear segments to avoid overcounting vertices (e.g., a hexagon may be misclassified as a pentagon if collinear points are not merged).\n- **Incorrect Parallelism Checks**: Use relative tolerance for slopes (e.g., if coordinates are large, adjust tolerance proportionally).\n- **Option Mismatch**: Ensure the selected option includes all and only the correct shapes. Do not choose an option with extra shapes.\n\n### Few-Shot Examples:\n[Example 1: Correct Analysis]\nPath: M 0,0 L 10,0 L 10,10 L 0,10 L 0,0 M 2,2 L 8,2 L 8,8 L 2,8 L 2,2\nShapes: Square (outer) and square (inner). But inner square has diagonals? No, only edges. However, option says \"no diagonals drawn\", so both are valid. But options may not include this combination. If no option has two squares, choose \"none\".\n[Example 2: Avoid Implied Connection]\nPath: M 0,0 L 5,0 L 5,5 L 0,5  # Missing closing segment. Imply connection from (0,5) to (0,0)? Yes, since aligned. Forms a square.\n[Example 3: Collinearity]\nPath: M 0,0 L 3,0 L 5,0 L 5,5 L 0,5 L 0,0  # Collinear points (0,0), (3,0), (5,0). Merge to form edge from (0,0) to (5,0). So polygon is a square.\n[Example 4: Embedded Shape]\nPath: M 0,0 L 5,0 L 5,5 L 0,5 L 0,0 M 1,1 L 4,1 L 4,4 L 1,4 L 1,1  # Outer square and inner square. But inner square is distinct. If options include \"two squares\", select it.\n[Example 5: No Option Match]\nPath: M 0,0 L 1,0 L 1,1 L 0,1 L 0,0  # Square. If options include only triangles, choose \"none\".\n\nNow, apply these steps to the given path and options.\n\nOptions: [List of options here]\n\nAnswer:",

                "prompt": "You are given an SVG path element description and a list of candidate shapes. Decide which option(s) match the visualization of the path.\n\n### Important Guidelines:\n- The path may consist of multiple disconnected line segments. When visualized together, these segments may form one or more geometric shapes.\n- A shape with n sides may be drawn with more than n lines (e.g., a triangle might be drawn with 4 lines if two are collinear).\n- Coordinates are rounded to 5 decimal places, so ignore slight differences. Approximate right angles, parallel lines, and equal lengths should be accepted.\n- Shapes need not be explicitly closed; if segments visually form a shape (e.g., three lines form a triangle even if not connected end-to-end), it counts. If endpoints are aligned horizontally or vertically (within 0.001 tolerance), consider them connected.\n- Multiple shapes may be present in the same path.\n- Diagonals are internal lines connecting non-adjacent vertices; edges are part of the perimeter. If an option says \"no diagonals drawn,\" ensure no such internal lines exist. Collinear segments on the perimeter are allowed.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n1. **Parse and Preprocess the Path**: Extract all line segments from `M` and `L` commands. Merge collinear segments (slopes within 0.01) with endpoints within 0.001 into single edges. Group segments into connected components based on endpoint proximity (within 0.001). Ignore segments shorter than 0.01 units unless critical for closure.\n2. **Reconstruct Polygons**: For each connected component, form closed polygons by connecting endpoints that are within 0.001. A polygon is closed if its start and end points are within 0.001 or if segments are collinear and aligned.\n3. **Identify Key Features**: For each polygon, compute approximate slopes, lengths, and angles:\n   - Consider lines parallel if slopes differ by < 0.01.\n   - Consider lines perpendicular if one is horizontal (|slope| < 0.01) and the other vertical (|slope| > 100), or if the dot product is < 0.01.\n   - Consider lengths equal if difference < 0.01.\n4. **Check for Shapes**: For each polygon, determine its type:\n   - **Triangle**: Three sides. Check for right angle using dot product.\n   - **Rectangle**: Four sides with four right angles and two pairs of parallels.\n   - **Square**: Rectangle with equal side lengths.\n   - **Parallelogram**: Two pairs of parallel sides.\n   - **Trapezoid**: Exactly one pair of parallel sides.\n   - **Pentagon**: Five-sided polygon (convex or concave, regular or irregular). Regular requires equal sides and angles.\n   - **Hexagon**: Six-sided polygon (regular only if option 10).\n5. **Check for Diagonals**: For each shape, if the option says \"no diagonals drawn,\" ensure there are no internal lines connecting non-adjacent vertices.\n6. **Handle Multiple Shapes**: The path may contain multiple distinct polygons. List all that match the candidate options. If two polygons share an edge, they are separate shapes.\n7. **Match to Options**: Compare the found shapes to the given options. Select the option that includes all correct shapes and no incorrect ones. If no option matches, choose \"none\".\n\n### Examples of Common Mistakes to Avoid:\n- **Overcomplication**: Do not reconstruct the entire polygon if unnecessary. Focus on key segments.\n- **Ignoring Collinearity**: Merge collinear segments into single edges; do not treat them as separate lines.\n- **Exact Calculations**: Avoid precise dot products or distances. Use rounding to judge parallels and right angles.\n- **Missing Shapes**: Check for multiple shapes; the answer may be a combination.\n- **Option Mismatch**: If the correct combination is not listed, choose \"none\" only if no option is correct. Otherwise, select the closest match that includes all correct shapes.\n\n### Example Analysis (Few-Shot):\n[Example 1]\nPath: Contains a convex pentagon formed by five points, but drawn with multiple collinear segments. After merging, it is an irregular convex pentagon with no diagonals. Option 7 is correct.\n[Example 2]\nPath: Contains a right triangle where the hypotenuse is drawn as multiple collinear segments. After merging, it is a right triangle. Option 4 is correct.\n[Example 3]\nPath: Contains a rectangle and a right triangle sharing an edge. Both are distinct shapes. Options 1 and 4 are correct.\n[Example 4]\nPath: Contains a concave pentagon with an internal diagonal. Option 8 is incorrect if \"no diagonals drawn\" is required.\n[Example 5]\nPath: Contains a trapezoid with one pair of parallel sides. Option 6 is correct.\n\nNow, apply these steps to the given path and options.\n\nOptions: [List of options here]\n\nAnswer:",

A full circle is typically made with two or four arc commands.\n\n**Examples of Correct Reasoning:**\n\n**Example 1: Degenerate Path**\n**Input:** `<path d=\"M 18.32,43.48 A 12.66,12.66 94.39 1,0 20.26,18.23 A 12.66,12.66 94.39 1,0 18.32,43.48\"/>`\n**Reasoning:** The second arc uses identical parameters to the first, meaning it retraces the first arc in reverse. The net visible result is degenerate (nothing is drawn). However, the arc parameters (equal radii of 12.66) indicate the intent was to draw a circular shape.

Vectors: AB = (-79.32, -4.66), BC = (2.55, -43.38). Dot product ≈ -0.206 (|dot| < 0.1), so ∠ABC ≈ 90°. Similarly, all angles are right angles.

Use tolerance of `0.05` for parallel lines (equal slopes) or perpendicular lines (slopes are negative reciprocals).\n5.  **Match to Shape:** Follow this specificity hierarchy:\n    *   **Circle/Ellipse:** If composed of arcs with equal (circle) or different (ellipse) radii.\n    *   **Triangle/Quadrilateral/Polygon:** First identify number of sides.\n    *   **Special Quadrilaterals:** Check in this order:\n        1.  **Square:** 4 equal sides, 4 right angles.\n        2.  **Rectangle:** 4 right angles, opposite sides equal.\n        3.  **Kite:** Two distinct pairs of adjacent equal sides.\n        4.  **Rhombus:** 4 equal sides.\n        5.  **Parallelogram:** Both pairs of opposite sides parallel.\n        6.  **Trapezoid:** At least one pair of parallel sides.\n    *   *Always choose the most specific option available in the list.*\n6.  **Final Decision:** If properties match a specific shape within tolerances, select it. For degenerate paths, identify intent from first valid segment's parameters.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n- **Floating-Point Precision:** Use tolerances for all comparisons. Do not expect perfect equality.\n- **Intent Over Literal Interpretation:** Infer the intended shape from parameters (e.g., equal radii indicate circle, right angles indicate rectangle).\n- **Option Availability:** Your answer must be from provided options. If your deduced shape isn't listed, find its most specific parent category that is listed.\n\n**Example Analysis 1 (Degenerate Path):**\n**Input:** `<path d=\"M 18.32,43.48 A 12.66,12.66 94.39 1,0 20.26,18.23 A 12.66,12.66 94.39 1,0 18.32,43.48\"/>`\n**Reasoning:** The second arc retraces the first. Net visible result is degenerate. Arc parameters (equal radii of 12.66) indicate intent to draw a circle.\n**Conclusion:** circle\n\n**Example Analysis 2 (Quadrilateral with Right Angles):**\n**Input:** `<path d=\"M 31.84,9.21 L 39.79,23.26 L 46.03,19.73 L 38.09,5.68 M 38.09,5.68 L 31.84,9.21\"/>`\n**Vertices:** A(31.84,9.21), B(39.79,23.26), C(46.03,19.73), D(38.09,5.68)\n**Slopes:** AB(~1.77), BC(~-0.565), CD(~1.77), DA(~-0.565). ∴ AB ∥ CD and BC ∥ DA (parallelogram).\n**Angles:** Dot product of AB & BC ≈ 0 (perpendicular). All angles are right angles within tolerance.\n**Conclusion:** This is a rectangle (available option), not just a trapezoid or parallelogram.\n\nNow, analyze the following question and options.\nQuestion:\nThis SVG path element <path d=\"PATH\"/> draws a\nOptions:\n[LIST OF OPTIONS]",

Each `M` starts a new, independent subpath.\n- Scan for command types:\n  - If the path contains **any `A` (arc) commands**, it is a **circular-related shape** (e.g., circle, ellipse, sector). Proceed to **Step 2A**.\n  - If the path contains **any `C`, `S`, `Q`, or `T` commands** (Bézier curves), the shape is **curved** and likely not a basic polygon.\n  - If the path contains **only `M`, `L`, `H`, `V`, and/or `Z` commands**, it is composed of straight lines. Proceed to **Step 2B**.\n\n**Step 2A: Analyze Circular Paths (Arcs)**\nFor paths with `A` commands:\n- Extract arc parameters: radii (`rx, ry`) and endpoints.\n- Check if the path closes with `Z` or returns to the start.\n- **Crucial:** Check for lines connecting to a common center point. If present, it is likely a **sector**.\n\n**Step 2B: Analyze Straight-Line Paths**\n1. **Identify Subpaths:** Split the path into separate subpaths at each `M`. For each subpath, list all absolute points (convert `H`/`V` to coordinates).\n2. **Check Closure per Subpath:** A subpath is closed if it ends with `Z` or if its endpoint equals its start point.\n3. **Synthesize the Overall Shape:**\n   - If there is **only one closed subpath**, treat it as a single polygon. Count its **unique vertices** and proceed to classify.\n   - If there are **multiple subpaths**, determine if they connect to form a single shape:\n     - *Example:* `M A L B M B L C M C L A` forms a **triangle** via three lines.\n     - Subpaths that do not connect form separate shapes (e.g., two lines).\n4. **Classify the Polygon:**\n   - For closed shapes, map vertex count: 3 = triangle, 4 = quadrilateral, etc.\n   - For quadrilaterals, check geometric properties:\n     - Right angles and equal opposite sides → **rectangle**\n     - Two pairs of parallel sides → **parallelogram** (if no rectangle, may be trapezoid)\n     - One pair of parallel sides → **trapezoid**\n     - Adjacent pairs of equal sides → **kite**\n\n**Step 3: Match to Options**\nChoose the most specific option from the list. If the shape is drawn by multiple connected subpaths (e.g., outline of a rectangle), select that shape.\n\n---\n\n**Examples to Avoid Common Mistakes:**\n- **Path:** `M A L B M B L C L D M D L A`\n  - **Incorrect:** Treating as one quadrilateral with 4 vertices.\n  - **Correct:** Three subpaths that form a closed quadrilateral outline (e.g., rectangle).\n- **Path:** `M 59.00,38.00 L 66.02,48.94 A 13.00,13.00 0.00 0,1 53.59,49.82 L 59.00,38.00`\n  - **Incorrect:** Counting only `L` points yields a line.\n  - **Correct:** Contains an arc and lines to a center → **sector**.\n\nNow, analyze the following path:",

Follow these steps precisely:\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Path Type**\nScan the entire `d` attribute for command types.\n- If the path contains **any `A` (arc) commands**, it is a **circular-related shape** (e.g., circle, ellipse, sector). Proceed to **Step 2A**.\n- If the path contains **any `C`, `S`, `Q`, or `T` commands** (Bézier curves), the shape is **curved** and likely not a basic polygon. Pay close attention to the options.\n- If the path contains **only `M`, `L`, `H`, `V`, and/or `Z` commands**, it is a **polygon or line**. Proceed to **Step 2B**.\n\n**Step 2A: Analyze Circular Paths (Arcs)**\nFor paths with `A` commands:\n- Extract the arc parameters: radii (`rx, ry`) and the arc's endpoint.\n- Check if the path ends at its start point (via `Z` or coordinates).\n- **Crucial: Check for lines to a common point.** If the path has lines from a central point to the arc's start and end, it is a **sector**.\n  - *Example:* `M C L P1 A ... P2 L C` forms a sector, where `C` is the center.\n- If the arc is the primary element and forms a full circle (often with two symmetric arcs), it is a **circle** (if `rx == ry`) or an **ellipse** (if `rx != ry`).\n\n**Step 2B: Analyze Polygonal Paths**\nFor paths with only `M`, `L`, `H`, `V`, `Z`:\n1. Extract all absolute points from `M`, `L`, `H`, and `V` commands (convert `H`/`V` to full coordinates).\n2. List points in order, removing consecutive duplicates. If the path closes with `Z`, it returns to the start; do not add an extra point.\n3. Count the **unique vertices**.\n4. If the number of vertices is 4, proceed to **Step 2B-1: Classify Quadrilateral**.\n5. Otherwise, map the count: 2 = line, 3 = triangle, 5 = pentagon, 6 = hexagon, 7 = heptagon, 8 = octagon.\n\n**Step 2B-1: Classify Quadrilateral**\nFor paths with 4 vertices (A, B, C, D in order):\n- Compute vectors for each side: AB, BC, CD, DA.\n- Check for parallel sides: Two sides are parallel if their vectors are scalar multiples (within tolerance ±0.01).\n- Check for right angles: For each vertex, compute the dot product between vectors of adjacent sides. If |dot product| < 0.01, the angle is 90°.\n- Check side lengths (using distance formula) with tolerance (±0.01).\n- If all four angles are 90°, it is a **rectangle**.\n- Else if two pairs of adjacent sides are equal, it is a **kite**.\n- Else if at least one pair of sides is parallel, it is a **trapezoid**.\n- Else, it is a generic quadrilateral (choose best fit from options).\n\n**Step 3: Match to Options**\nChoose the most specific and accurate option from the provided list.\n\n**Note on Numerical Precision:** Use a tolerance (e.g., ±0.01) for all floating-point comparisons (lengths, dot products, vector multiples).\n\n---\n\n**Examples to Avoid Common Mistakes:**\n\n**Example 1:**\n- **Path:** `M 59.00,38.00 L 66.02,48.94 A 13.00,13.00 0.00 0,1 53.59,49.82 L 59.00,38.00`\n- **Incorrect:** Ignoring the arc and counting only `M`/`L` points yields 2 vertices (line).\n- **Correct:** The path has an `A` command (Step 1 → Step 2A). It has lines from a center point (`59.00,38.00`) to the arc's start and end, forming a **sector**.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- **Path:** `M 31.84,9.21 L 39.79,23.26 L 46.03,19.73 L 38.09,5.68 M 38.09,5.68 L 31.84,9.21`\n- **Incorrect:** Classifying as trapezoid due to parallel sides but missing right angles.\n- **Correct:** After extracting points (A:31.84,9.21; B:39.79,23.26; C:46.03,19.73; D:38.09,5.68), compute vectors:\n  - AB ≈ (7.95,14.05), BC ≈ (6.24,-3.53)\n  - Dot product AB · BC ≈ 7.95*6.24 + 14.05*(-3.53) ≈ 49.608 - 49.5965 ≈ 0.0115 (<0.01) → angle at B is 90°.\n  - Similarly, all angles are 90° → **rectangle**.\n\nNow, analyze the following path:",

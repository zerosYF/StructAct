State all intermediate results.\n7.  **Review and Validate:**\n    *   **Check the Question:** Does my final answer directly match what was asked for?\n    *   **Check Reasonableness:** Is the answer plausible within the problem's context?\n    *   **Check Calculations:** Verify key arithmetic.\n8.  **Final Answer Format:**\n    *   The answer must be a **plain number** inside `<answer>` tags.\n    *   **If the answer is a time of day:** Output only the **hour** as a number (e.g., for 2:00 PM, output `2`).\n    *   **If the answer is a monetary value:** Round to the nearest whole number and omit the currency symbol.\n    *   **For all other answers:** Output only the numeric value.\n\nAfter completing all steps, output the final answer within `<answer>` tags.",

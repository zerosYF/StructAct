Reference this table strictly.\n    Example:\n    | Statement | Truth Value | Reason |\n    |-----------|-------------|--------|\n    | The capital of India is Mumbai. | False | Capital is New Delhi. |\n\n2.  **Validate parentheses structure**: For each expression, count opening and closing parentheses to ensure they balance. Use a counter: increment for '(', decrement for ')'. If unbalanced, reparse carefully.\n\n3.  **Break down expressions step-by-step**:\n    - Start from the absolute innermost parentheses.\n    - Compute arithmetic (including `max`, `min`, operations) exactly: use fractions to avoid rounding errors.\n    - Evaluate relational comparisons (<, >, <=, etc.) precisely.\n    - For negation chains: reduce systematically (e.g., `not not X ≡ X`; `not not not X ≡ not X`; apply modulo 2: even `not`s cancel, odd reduce to one `not`).\n    - At every logical operation (`and`/`or`), check for short-circuiting: if left operand of `and` is `False`, stop and yield `False`; if left operand of `or` is `True`, stop and yield `True`.\n\n4.  **Use intermediate variables for clarity**: For complex subexpressions, assign results to variables (e.g., `P = innermost part`) to simplify propagation and avoid reevaluation.\n\n5.  **Verify only one True**: After initial evaluation, if multiple expressions appear True, recheck each true candidate from scratch.

Apply this recursively from the innermost negation outward.\n3. **Arithmetic Evaluation**: Compute all mathematical expressions carefully.

Start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.\n   - For each sub-expression, compute its value and label it (e.g., S1, S2) for reference.\n   - Replace all capital statements and arithmetic expressions with their boolean values as you go.\n\n2. **Factual Verification**:\n   - Before evaluation, identify all capital statements. Verify each against common knowledge (e.g., \"The capital of Turkey is Ankara\") and note their truth values in a fact table.\n   - Example: \"The capital of Azerbaijan is Ganja\" → False.\n\n3. **Negation Simplification**:\n   - For any chain of `n` negations: if `n` is even, remove all `not`s; if `n` is odd, replace with one `not`. Apply this recursively from the inside out.\n   - Example: `not not not not X` → X; `not not not X` → `not X`.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Evaluation**:\n   - Follow strict arithmetic precedence: parentheses, exponents, multiplication/division (left to right), addition/subtraction (left to right).\n   - Compute fractions exactly or with sufficient decimal precision.\n   - Example: `-4 - (-5 / 1)` → compute division first: `-5/1 = -5`, then subtraction: `-4 - (-5) = 1`.\n\n5. **Logical Precedence and Grouping**:\n   - Always evaluate parentheses first. If no parentheses, remember: `and` has higher precedence than `or`.\n   - Example: `A and B or C` is `(A and B) or C`.\n\n6. **Consistency Check Protocol**:\n   - After evaluating all expressions, if more than one is true, re-check each step for errors in arithmetic, fact-checking, or negation counting.\n   - Pay special attention to expressions that were true.\n\n7. **Common Pitfalls and Examples**:\n   - Avoid miscounting negations in long chains (e.g., `not not not not X` → X).\n   - Avoid misinterpreting operator precedence (e.g., `A and B or C` is `(A and B) or C`).\n   - Avoid incorrect arithmetic with negative numbers or fractions (e.g., `-5 / -1 = 5`).\n   - Avoid overlooking factual errors in capital statements (e.g., \"The capital of Nigeria is Lagos\" is false; it is Abuja).\n\n### Examples of Past Mistakes (Few-Shot References):\n- **Example 1**: In \"not not not (The capital of Turkey is Istanbul)\", the model incorrectly simplified to True.

Follow these steps rigorously for each expression:\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation Protocol:\n1. **Decompose into sub-expressions**: For each expression, identify all innermost sub-expressions (arithmetic, comparisons, factual claims, and boolean literals). Assign them intermediate variables (e.g., `P = arithmetic expression`, `Q = factual claim`). Evaluate each variable step-by-step before combining.\n\n2. **Simplify negation chains immediately**: For any chain of `not`s, count the number of `not`s:\n   - Even number (e.g., 2, 4, 6): replace with the original expression.\n   - Odd number (e.g., 1, 3, 5): replace with the negation of the original expression.\n   - Example: `not not not not X` = `X` (even), `not not not X` = `not X` (odd).\n\n3. **Compute arithmetic with explicit steps**:\n   - Evaluate operations in order: parentheses, then `*`, `/`, then `+`, `-`, then comparisons.\n   - For `max` and `min`, list all values and identify the maximum/minimum.\n   - Show all intermediate calculations (e.g., `-1 * 10 = -10`, `-4 * 4 = -16`, `-10 + (-16) = -26`).\n   - Double-check negative numbers and fractions (e.g., `-7 - (-6/4) = -7 + 1.5 = -5.5`).\n\n4. **Evaluate factual claims accurately**:\n   - Use this knowledge base:\n     - The capital of UAE is Abu Dhabi (not Dubai).\n     - The capital of Norway is Oslo (not Bergen).\n     - The capital of India is New Delhi (not Mumbai).\n     - The capital of Cameroon is Yaoundé (not Douala).\n     - The capital of Belarus is Minsk (not Grodno).\n     - The capital of Nepal is Kathmandu (not Pokhara).\n     - The capital of Iraq is Baghdad (not Beirut).\n     - The capital of Jordan is Amman (not Beirut).\n     - The capital of Turkey is Ankara (not Istanbul).\n     - The capital of Canada is Ottawa (not Toronto).\n     - The capital of Afghanistan is Kabul (not Kandahar).\n     - The capital of Nigeria is Abuja (not Lagos).\n     - The capital of Colombia is Bogotá (not Medellin).\n     - The capital of Malaysia is Putrajaya (or Kuala Lumpur for some contexts; treat as Putrajaya).\n   - For any claim not listed, assume it is `False`.\n   - Ignore minor phrasing variations (e.g., \"the Nigeria\" should be treated as \"Nigeria\").\n\n5. **Enforce logical precedence and grouping**:\n   - `and` has higher precedence than `or`.\n   - Always add explicit parentheses to reflect grouping before evaluating (e.g., rewrite `A and B or C` as `(A and B) or C`).\n   - Resolve parentheses from the innermost outward.\n\n6. **Verify consistency across all expressions**:\n   - After evaluating all options, if multiple appear `True`, re-check each step for errors (common pitfalls below).\n   - Only one expression can be `True`.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid (with Examples):\n- **Negation miscounting**: `not not not True` = `not True` = `False` (not `True`).\n- **Factual errors**: \"The capital of UAE is Dubai\" is `False` (correct: Abu Dhabi).\n- **Arithmetic errors**: \n  - `-7 - (-6/4)` = `-7 - (-1.5)` = `-7 + 1.5 = -5.5` (not `-8.5`).\n  - `max(-1, 2, 6, 1)` = `6`, `min(...)` = `-1`, difference = `7` (not `5`).\n- **Precedence errors**: `A and B or C` is `(A and B) or C`, not `A and (B or C)`.\n- **Premature evaluation**: Do not combine sub-expressions until all parts are simplified.\n\n### Demonstration with Complex Example:\nConsider a nested expression:  \n`not not ( (max(1,2) - min(1,2) > 0) and (The capital of France is Paris) )`  \n- Step 1: Let `P = max(1,2)=2`, `Q = min(1,2)=1`, then `P - Q = 1 > 0` → `True`.  \n- Step 2: `not not True` = `True` (two `not`s).  \n- Step 3: \"The capital of France is Paris\" → `True`.  \n- Step 4: `True and True` → `True`.\n\n### Final Workflow:\nFor each expression (A through E):  \n1. Decompose into sub-expressions and assign variables.  \n2. Simplify negations by counting.  \n3. Compute arithmetic and comparisons with shown steps.  \n4. Evaluate factual claims against the knowledge base.  \n5. Combine results using logical rules and explicit parentheses.  \n6. After all expressions are evaluated, confirm only one is `True`. If not, re-check for errors.\n\nGiven that only one expression evaluates to `True`, analyze each option methodically and conclude with the correct choice.",

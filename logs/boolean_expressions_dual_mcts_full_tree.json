    "prompt": "You are an expert boolean expression evaluator. Your task is to determine which of five complex expressions (A through E) evaluates to True. Only one is true. Follow these enhanced steps precisely:\n\n### Step 1: Parse and Group with Explicit Parentheses\n- Before evaluation, rewrite each expression with explicit parentheses to ensure correct operator precedence and grouping.\n- Use a stack-based approach to track nested parentheses and negations systematically.\n- Example: Rewrite `A and B or C` as `(A and B) or C` to avoid ambiguity.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify Negations with a Counter\n- For each sub-expression, count consecutive `not` operations from innermost parentheses outward.\n- Maintain a negation counter: increment for each `not`, and when reaching a non-negated term, apply:\n  - Even number of `not`s → result is `X`\n  - Odd number of `not`s → result is `not X`\n- Record the negation count at each step in an evaluation log.\n- *Complete all negation simplification before proceeding to other steps.*\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Arithmetic with Precision\n- Compute arithmetic expressions step-by-step:\n  - First: `*` and `/` (left to right)\n  - Then: `+` and `-` (left to right)\n  - Respect negative signs and operator precedence.\n- For division, compute exactly using fractions where possible. If decimals are needed, retain at least 4 decimal places for intermediate calculations.\n- For comparisons: \n  - \"is greater than\" = `>`\n  - \"is less than or equal to\" = `<=`\n  - etc.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Factual Statements Strictly\n- Treat natural language statements (e.g., \"The capital of X is Y\") as booleans using this exact capital list:\n  - Afghanistan: Kabul\n  - Armenia: Yerevan\n  - Azerbaijan: Baku\n  - Belarus: Minsk\n  - Cameroon: Yaoundé\n  - Canada: Ottawa\n  - Colombia: Bogota\n  - Denmark: Copenhagen\n  - Gambia: Banjul\n  - Germany: Berlin\n  - India: New Delhi\n  - Iran: Tehran\n  - Jordan: Amman\n  - Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur\n  - Nepal: Kathmandu\n  - Nigeria: Abuja\n  - Norway: Oslo\n  - Turkey: Ankara\n  - UAE: Abu Dhabi\n- Any textual deviation from this list (including extra words, typos, or formatting differences) → `False`\n\n### Step 5: Apply Logical Operations with Care\n- Precedence: Highest `not`, then `and`, then `or`\n- Use parentheses to explicitly group sub-expressions\n- Short-circuit efficiently but cautiously:\n  - In `and`: If any part is False → stop early (whole False)\n  - In `or`: If any part is True → stop early (whole True)\n- *Exception: Do not short-circuit if negation simplification or arithmetic evaluation is incomplete in the current sub-expression*\n\n### Step 6: Step-by-Step Evaluation Protocol\n1. Start from innermost sub-expressions (arithmetic, facts, or negations)\n2. For each sub-expression:\n   - Simplify negations completely using the counter method\n   - Compute arithmetic results with precise fractional/decimal values\n   - Verify factual statements against the capital list exactly\n   - Record intermediate truth value in an evaluation log\n3. Work outward systematically, maintaining the log for each nesting level\n4. For deeply nested expressions, create a detailed evaluation log showing each step\n\n### Step 7: Consistency Check\n- If multiple expressions seem True, re-evaluate in this order:\n  - First: Expressions with deepest nesting or most negations\n  - Recount negations in problematic expressions using the counter method\n  - Recompute arithmetic with exact precision (use fractions)\n  - Reverify factual statements against capital list strictly\n- Remember: Only one expression is True\n\n### Step 8: Output Format\n- After complete evaluation, output only the correct label, e.g., `(C)`\n- If uncertain, re-evaluate before outputting\n\n### Critical Examples for Guidance (Learn from Common Errors):\n\n**Example 1 - Negation Depth:**\nInput: `not not not not not (True)`\nSimplify: 5 `not`s (odd) → `not True` = `False`\n\n**Example 2 - Arithmetic Precision:**\nInput: `-8 / -2 * 3 + 1`\nStep 1: `-8 / -2 = 4`\nStep 2: `4 * 3 = 12`\nStep 3: `12 + 1 = 13`\n\n**Example 3 - Factual Accuracy:**\nInput: `(The capital of Nigeria is Abuja.) and (The capital of Norway is Bergen.)`\nEvaluate: `True and False` = `False` (Bergen ≠ Oslo)\n\n**Example 4 - Short-Circuiting:**\nInput: `False and (complex expression)`\nEvaluate: Immediately `False` (short-circuit)\n\n**Example 5 - Nested Evaluation:**\nInput: `not (not (5 > 3) or (2 * 2 = 4))`\nStep 1: Innermost: `5 > 3` = `True`\nStep 2: `not True` = `False`\nStep 3: `2 * 2 = 4` = `True`\nStep 4: `False or True` = `True`\nStep 5: `not True` = `False`\n\n**Example 6 - Common Mistake (Grouping):**\nInput: `not A and B or C`\nIncorrect: `not (A and B) or C`\nCorrect: `((not A) and B) or C` (respect precedence)\n\n**Example 7 - Common Mistake (Factual Deviation):**\nInput: `(The capital of the Nigeria is Abuja.)`\nEvaluate: `False` (extra \"the\" is deviation from list)\n\nNow, evaluate the following expressions carefully using this enhanced protocol:",

However, in (C), a similar structure was misparsed. Always verify the scope of `not` operations.\n- **Example 2 (Error)**: Factual statements like \"The capital of India is Mumbai\" are `False` (capital is New Delhi). Do not assume all statements are True.\n- **Example 3 (Error)**: `not not not False` equals `True` (since `not not not False = not not True = not False = True`). Apply negation rules consistently.\n- **Example 4 (Error)**: In expression (A), the entire inner expression evaluated to `False`, so `not (False)` became `True`. But in (D), an `or (True)` term was overlooked.

Apply these immediately when encountered to terminate evaluation early.\n4. **Compute arithmetic precisely**: Evaluate all arithmetic and comparisons carefully. Double-check calculations involving negative numbers, fractions, and order of operations. Verify each arithmetic operation twice.\n5. **Leverage the constraint**: Only one expression is True.

Always verify the outermost operation.\n- **Example 2**: In expression (B), the model misparsed operator precedence between `and` and `or`. Count parentheses carefully.\n- **Example 3**: In expression (C), the model incorrectly evaluated `not not not True` as `True` (should be `False`).

For highly nested expressions, consider labeling intermediate values (e.g., Let X = ...) to manage complexity.\n2. **Handle factual statements accurately**: Use the following factual truths (common knowledge):\n   - The capital of Nigeria is Abuja.\n   - The capital of Turkey is Ankara.\n   - The capital of Canada is Ottawa.\n   - The capital of Afghanistan is Kabul.\n   - The capital of India is New Delhi.\n   - The capital of Denmark is Copenhagen.\n   - The capital of Norway is Oslo.\n   - The capital of Gambia is Banjul.\n   - The capital of Armenia is Yerevan.\n   - The capital of Iraq is Baghdad.\n   - The capital of Nepal is Kathmandu.\n   - The capital of Jordan is Amman.\n   - The capital of UAE is Abu Dhabi.\n   - The capital of Colombia is Bogotá.\n   - The capital of Malaysia is Kuala Lumpur.\n   - The capital of Azerbaijan is Baku.\n   - The capital of Iran is Tehran.\n   Any deviation from these is False.\n3. **Apply logical rules rigorously**:\n   - Simplify negations: `not not A = A`, `not not not A = not A`. For long chains, count the number of `not`s: even number => A, odd number => not A.\n   - Use domination: `A and False = False`, `A or True = True`. Apply these immediately to short-circuit evaluation.\n4. **Compute arithmetic precisely**: Evaluate all arithmetic and comparisons carefully. Double-check calculations step-by-step, especially with negative numbers and fractions. Write intermediate values to avoid propagation of errors.\n5. **Leverage the constraint**: Only one expression is True. If multiple seem True, re-evaluate them systematically. Focus on complex nesting or arithmetic where errors are likely.\n6. **Identify critical sub-expressions**: Look for terms like `and (False)` or `or (True)` that force the value of larger expressions, enabling early termination. Constants like `(True)` or `(False)` should be used immediately to simplify.\n7. **Avoid grouping errors**: Pay close attention to parentheses and operator precedence. Count parentheses to ensure correct parsing. If needed, re-write expressions with explicit brackets for clarity.\n8. **Re-evaluation under constraint**: If you find multiple candidates for True, list them and re-check each step. Prioritize re-evaluating expressions with deep nesting, complex arithmetic, or ambiguous factual statements.\n\n### Key Strategies from Successful Cases:\n- **Innermost-first evaluation**: Always decompose expressions from the inside out, resolving each layer completely before proceeding.\n- **Re-evaluation under constraint**: If contradictions arise (e.g., multiple True expressions), systematically re-check steps, prioritizing areas with high complexity or potential mistakes.\n- **Factual consistency**: Assume no statement is True unless confirmed by the provided factual database.\n- **Logical shortcuts**: Use rules like domination to simplify without full computation (e.g., `and (False)` immediately implies False).\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid:\n- **Miscounting negations**: For expressions like `not not not (not X)`, count the total number of `not`s applied to X. Example: `not not not not A = A`.\n- **Overlooking constants**: `or (True)` always simplifies to True, and `and (False)` always simplifies to False, regardless of other terms.\n- **Arithmetic errors**: Double-check operations with negatives and fractions. Example: `-5 - (-2 / -2) = -5 - (1) = -6`.\n- **Factual inaccuracies**: Do not rely on memory; use the provided factual list strictly.\n- **Parentheses mismatches**: Ensure every opening parenthesis has a matching closing parenthesis. Consider using subexpression labels to avoid confusion.\n\n### Output Format:\nAfter analysis, output your answer in the format:  \n`<answer>(X)</answer>`\n\nNow, analyze the following expressions:",

                "prompt": "You are an assistant that determines which boolean expression evaluates to True. You are given five complex boolean expressions (A through E), and only one evaluates to True.\n\n### Guidelines:\n1. **Pre-evaluate all factual statements**: Before any simplification, identify all factual claims (e.g., \"The capital of Nepal is Kathmandu\") and determine their truth values using common knowledge. Create a reference table:\n   - Example: \"The capital of Nigeria is Abuja\" → True, \"The capital of Canada is Toronto\" → False.\n2. **Simplify systematically from innermost parentheses**:\n   - Break each expression into sub-expressions. Evaluate each layer completely before moving outward.\n   - For negation chains: \n        - `not not A = A`\n        - `not not not A = not A`\n        - In general, an even number of `not`s cancels out; an odd number is equivalent to a single `not`.\n3. **Apply logical shortcuts rigorously**:\n   - If you encounter `and (False)`, the entire conjunction is False (domination).\n   - If you encounter `or (True)`, the entire disjunction is True (domination).\n   - Use these to short-circuit evaluation where possible.\n4. **Compute arithmetic with extreme precision**:\n   - Evaluate all arithmetic operations step-by-step. Pay careful attention to signs and fractions.\n   - For comparisons (e.g., `<=`, `>`), double-check inequalities, especially with negative numbers.\n5. **Leverage the single-True constraint actively**:\n   - If multiple expressions appear True, re-evaluate the most complex or ambiguous sub-parts (e.g., deeply nested negations or arithmetic).\n   - If all expressions appear False, re-check the expression with the simplest structure or most error-prone components (e.g., factual statements or arithmetic).\n6. **Avoid grouping errors**:\n   - Count parentheses meticulously. Consider rewriting the expression with indentation or intermediate variable labels for clarity.\n7. **Output reasoning steps**:\n   - Before finalizing the answer, summarize key steps for each expression to ensure consistency.\n\n### Common Failure Examples to Avoid:\n- **Example 1 (Negation Miscount)**: \n   - `not not not False` was incorrectly simplified to `True` in some cases. Correct: `not not not False = not not True = not False = True`? Actually: \n        - `not False = True`\n        - `not True = False`\n        - `not False = True`? Wait, let's do stepwise: \n        - `not not not False` = `not (not (not False))` = `not (not True)` = `not False` = `True`. \n   - However, note that `not not not A` is indeed `not A`. So for `A=False`, `not not not False = not False = True`.\n   - But in practice, apply the rule: odd number of `not`s = `not A`; even number = `A`.\n- **Example 2 (Factual Error)**: \n   - \"The capital of India is Mumbai\" is False (it is New Delhi). Always verify facts.\n- **Example 3 (Arithmetic Error)**: \n   - `-50 <= -10` is True (since -50 is less than -10), but it was sometimes misjudged.\n   - `max(-6, 5, -10, -6) = 5`, `min = -10`, so `5 - (-10) = 15`, and `15 <= 10` is False.\n- **Example 4 (Constraint Ignored)**: \n   - When all expressions seemed False, the model did not re-check thoroughly. Use the constraint: exactly one must be True. If not, re-evaluate.\n\n### Output Format:\nAfter analysis, output:\n```\nReasoning: [Brief step-by-step summary for each expression, highlighting key simplifications and facts]\n<answer>(X)</answer>\n```\n\nNow, analyze the following expressions:",

Follow these steps meticulously:\n\n1. **Simplify Negations Recursively**:\n   - Start from the innermost parentheses and move outward.\n   - Count the number of consecutive `not`s: even number cancels out (e.g., `not not X` → `X`), odd number becomes a single `not` (e.g., `not not not X` → `not X`).\n   - Apply this rule repeatedly until no more simplifications are possible. Track each step to avoid miscounting.\n\n2. **Evaluate Components Step-by-Step**:\n   - Compute arithmetic expressions (*, /, +, -) in the correct order: multiplication/division before addition/subtraction. Be precise with negative numbers and fractions.\n   - For comparisons: convert phrases like \"is greater than\" to `>`, \"is less than or equal to\" to `<=`, etc.\n   - For natural language facts (e.g., \"The capital of X is Y\"), use accurate real-world knowledge.

Follow these steps precisely:\n\n1. **Count Parentheses and Structure First**:\n   - Before evaluating, analyze the expression structure by counting parentheses and identifying nesting levels.\n   - Use a systematic approach: work from innermost parentheses outward, labeling subparts (e.g., A1, A2) for clarity.\n   - Rewrite complex expressions with indentation or intermediate variables to avoid scope errors.\n\n2. **Simplify Negations Recursively and Explicitly**:\n   - Start from the innermost parentheses and move outward.\n   - Reduce `not` sequences step-by-step: \n        `not not X` becomes `X`, \n        `not not not X` becomes `not X`.\n   - Apply this rule repeatedly until no more simplifications are possible. Write intermediate steps to avoid miscounting.\n\n3. **Evaluate Components with Precision**:\n   - Compute arithmetic expressions (*, /, +, -) in the correct order (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction). Use parentheses to enforce order.\n   - Be exact with fractions and negative numbers (e.g., `-7 / -4 = 1.75`).\n   - For comparisons: use `>`, `<=`, etc., based on computed values.\n   - For natural language facts (e.g., \"The capital of X is Y\"), use this definitive list:\n        Azerbaijan: Baku, Armenia: Yerevan, Belarus: Minsk, \n        Canada: Ottawa, Iran: Tehran, Iraq: Baghdad, \n        Denmark: Copenhagen, UAE: Abu Dhabi, Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur,\n        Nigeria: Abuja, Gambia: Banjul, Nepal: Kathmandu,\n        Jordan: Amman, Norway: Oslo, Colombia: Bogota.\n   - If a fact is not listed, assume standard knowledge.\n\n4. **Apply Logical Precedence and Strict Short-Circuiting**:\n   - Highest: `not`\n   - Then: `and`\n   - Then: `or`\n   - In `and`, if any part is False, stop evaluating the rest immediately (return False).\n   - In `or`, if any part is True, stop evaluating the rest immediately (return True).\n   - Apply short-circuiting even in nested contexts.\n\n5. **Break Down and Evaluate Methodically**:\n   - Decompose each expression into smaller subparts. Evaluate each subpart independently before combining.\n   - For each subpart, state its truth value clearly before proceeding.\n\n6. **Verify Consistency and Recheck**:\n   - After evaluating all expressions, if more than one seems True, recheck each step for:\n        - Negation chain errors\n        - Arithmetic miscalculations\n        - Factual inaccuracies\n        - Short-circuiting oversights\n   - Ensure exactly one expression is True.

Always count parentheses carefully.\n- **Negation chains require step-by-step simplification**: e.g., `not not not True` → `not not False` → `not True` → `False`. Write each step.\n- **Arithmetic must be exact**: Fractions and negative numbers are error-prone. Compute intermediate values.\n- **Facts are fixed**: Use the provided capital list strictly (e.g., UAE is Abu Dhabi, not Dubai).\n- **Short-circuit aggressively**: In `and`, stop at first False; in `or`, stop at first True.\n- **If multiple expressions seem True, you made a mistake**: Recheck thoroughly.\n\n**Few-Shot Examples from Common Failures**:\n\nExample 1 (Negation Error):\nInput: `not not not (False)`\nStep-by-step: `not not not False` → `not not True` → `not False` → `True`\nIncorrect: Simplifying directly to `not False` without steps may cause errors.\n\nExample 2 (Fact Error):\nInput: `(The capital of UAE is Dubai.)`\nEvaluation: False (correct capital is Abu Dhabi).\n\nExample 3 (Short-Circuiting):\nInput: `(False and (5 * 6 > 30))`\nEvaluation: Stop after `False`, return False. Do not evaluate the arithmetic.\n\nExample 4 (Arithmetic Precision):\nInput: `-8 - (-7 / -4)`\nCompute: `-7 / -4 = 1.75`, then `-8 - 1.75 = -9.75`\n\nNow, evaluate the following expressions carefully:",

Follow these steps meticulously:\n\n### Step 1: Decompose and Label Subexpressions\n- Break down each expression into its smallest atomic components (arithmetic operations, comparisons, facts). Label them sequentially (S1, S2, S3, ...).\n- Evaluate each subexpression step by step:\n  - **Arithmetic**: Use PEMDAS strictly. Double-check operations with negative numbers:\n    - Division: e.g., `-7 / -4 = 1.75`\n    - Subtraction: e.g., `-8 - (-7) = -1`\n  - **Comparisons**: Evaluate correctly (e.g., `>` means strictly greater).\n  - **Facts**: Use accurate real-world knowledge. Capitals list (expand as needed):\n    - Azerbaijan: Baku, Armenia: Yerevan, Belarus: Minsk, \n    - Canada: Ottawa, Iran: Tehran, Iraq: Baghdad, \n    - Denmark: Copenhagen, UAE: Abu Dhabi, Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur,\n    - Gambia: Banjul, Norway: Oslo, Colombia: Bogota,\n    - Cameroon: Yaoundé, Nepal: Kathmandu, India: New Delhi,\n    - Turkey: Ankara, Nigeria: Abuja, Afghanistan: Kabul, Jordan: Amman.\n  - If a fact contains a typo (e.g., \"the Nigeria\") or is incorrect, assume false.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify Negations Recursively\n- Start from the innermost parentheses and move outward.\n- For any sequence of `not`s: count the number. If even, simplify to `X`; if odd, simplify to `not X`.\n- Example: `not not not X` → `not X` (3 is odd), `not not not not X` → `X` (4 is even).\n- Apply this rule recursively before combining with other operations.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Logical Precedence and Short-Circuit\n- Precedence: `not` > `and` > `or`.\n- In `and`, if the left operand is False, stop immediately (return False, skip right).\n- In `or`, if the left operand is True, stop immediately (return True, skip right).\n- Always respect parentheses grouping.\n\n### Step 4: Parentheses Matching\n- Use a counter to match parentheses. For every `(`, push; for every `)`, pop and evaluate the enclosed expression completely before moving outward.\n\n### Step 5: Output Intermediate Steps\n- For each expression, explicitly show the evaluation of key subparts to ensure transparency and avoid errors.\n\n### Step 6: Verify Consistency\n- After evaluating all expressions, if more than one seems True, recheck those with the most negations or arithmetic operations. Pay special attention to short-circuiting opportunities and fact accuracy.\n\n### Step 7: Output Format\n- After evaluation, output only the correct label, e.g., `(C)`.\n\n### Few-Shot Examples to Avoid Common Mistakes:\n\n**Example 1 (Negation Miscount):**\nInput: `not not not (not not (True))`\nSteps:\n  S1: `not not (True)` → `True` (2 `not`s, even)\n  S2: `not not not True` → `not not False` → `not True` → `False` (3 `not`s, odd → `not True`)\nOutput: False\n\n**Example 2 (Arithmetic Error):**\nInput: `-8 - (-7 / -4) > -6`\nSteps:\n  S1: `-7 / -4 = 1.75`\n  S2: `-8 - 1.75 = -9.75`\n  S3: `-9.75 > -6` → False\nOutput: False\n\n**Example 3 (Fact Handling):**\nInput: `(The capital of UAE is Dubai.)`\nFact: False (capital is Abu Dhabi)\nOutput: False\n\n**Example 4 (Short-Circuiting):**\nInput: `(False and (The capital of Mars is Olympus))`\nShort-circuit: Stop at `False`, ignore right part.\nOutput: False\n\n**Example 5 (Deep Nesting):**\nInput: `not (not not (not (True and False)))`\nSteps:\n  S1: `True and False` → False\n  S2: `not (False)` → True\n  S3: `not not True` → True\n  S4: `not True` → False\nOutput: False\n\nNow, evaluate the following expressions carefully:",

Second fact: False (capital is Naypyidaw). So `True and False` → `False`.\n\nExample 4 (Deep Nesting):  \nInput: `not (not (not (not (True)))`  \nSimplify stepwise:  \n- Innermost: `not (True)` → `False`  \n- Then: `not (False)` → `True`  \n- Then: `not (True)` → `False`  \n- Then: `not (False)` → `True`  \nSo final: `True`.\n\nExample 5 (Consistency Check):  \nIf both (B) and (E) seem True, re-check (B)'s arithmetic: e.g., `4 * -4` is `-16`, not `16`.

If even, simplify to `X`; if odd, simplify to `not X`.\n   - Example: `not not not X` → `not X` (3 is odd), `not not not not X` → `X` (4 is even).\n\n2. **Evaluate Components Step-by-Step**:\n   - Compute arithmetic expressions using PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division (left to right), Addition/Subtraction (left to right).\n   - For comparisons: \"is greater than\" = `>`, \"is less than or equal to\" = `<=`, etc.\n   - For natural language facts (e.g., \"The capital of X is Y\"), use accurate real-world knowledge. Common capitals:\n        Azerbaijan: Baku, Armenia: Yerevan, Belarus: Minsk, \n        Canada: Ottawa, Iran: Tehran, Iraq: Baghdad, \n        Denmark: Copenhagen, UAE: Abu Dhabi, Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur,\n        Gambia: Banjul, Norway: Oslo, Colombia: Bogota,\n        Cameroon: Yaoundé, Nepal: Kathmandu, India: New Delhi.\n   - If unsure about a fact, assume it is false unless it is very well-known.\n\n3. **Apply Logical Precedence and Short-Circuit Rigorously**:\n   - Highest: `not`\n   - Then: `and`\n   - Then: `or`\n   - In `and`, if any part is False, immediately stop evaluating the rest (return False).\n   - In `or`, if any part is True, immediately stop evaluating the rest (return True).\n\n4. **Break Down Complex Expressions into Subparts**:\n   - Decompose each expression into smaller, manageable subparts. Label them (e.g., S1, S2) and evaluate each independently.\n   - Use parentheses counting to ensure correct grouping.\n\n5. **Verify Consistency and Re-evaluate if Needed**:\n   - After evaluating all expressions, if more than one seems True, recheck those with the most negations or arithmetic operations.\n   - Cross-verify using short-circuiting and negation rules.\n\n6. **Output Format**:\n   - After evaluation, output only the correct label, e.g., `(C)`.\n\n**Critical Examples for Guidance**:\n\nExample 1:  \nInput: `not not not (True)`  \nSimplify: `not not not True` → `not not False` → `not True` → `False`\n\nExample 2 (Short-Circuiting):  \nInput: `(False and (The capital of Mars is Olympus))`  \nShort-circuit: Stop at `False`, ignore the fact (even if undefined).\n\nExample 3 (Arithmetic and Facts):  \nInput: `(max(4, -7, 6, -10) - min(4, -7, 6, -10) <= 2)`  \nArithmetic: max=6, min=-10 → 6 - (-10)=16 → 16<=2?

Follow these steps precisely and systematically:\n\n### Step 1: Parse and Structure the Expression\n- Identify and number all parentheses levels from innermost (level 1) to outermost.\n- Create an evaluation log to track each sub-expression's truth value at each level.\n- *Do not proceed until the entire structure is mapped.*\n\n### Step 2: Simplify Negations with Isolated Precision\n- For each parenthesized sub-expression, count all consecutive `not` operations applied directly to it.\n- Apply negation reduction strictly:\n  - Even number of `not`s → result is `X`\n  - Odd number of `not`s → result is `not X`\n- *Complete negation simplification for each sub-expression in isolation before combining with any other operations.*\n- Example: `not not not (X)` becomes `not X` (3 `not`s, odd).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Arithmetic with Exact Computation\n- Compute arithmetic expressions step-by-step:\n  - First: `*` and `/` (left to right, using float division if needed)\n  - Then: `+` and `-` (left to right)\n  - Respect negative signs and operator precedence explicitly.\n- For comparisons, convert natural language to symbols:\n  - \"is greater than\" → `>`\n  - \"is less than or equal to\" → `<=`\n  - etc.\n- *Show all intermediate arithmetic results in the log.*\n\n### Step 4: Verify Factual Statements Rigorously\n- Treat natural language statements (e.g., \"The capital of X is Y\") as booleans using this exact capital list:\n  - Afghanistan: Kabul\n  - Armenia: Yerevan\n  - Azerbaijan: Baku\n  - Belarus: Minsk\n  - Cameroon: Yaoundé\n  - Canada: Ottawa\n  - Colombia: Bogota\n  - Denmark: Copenhagen\n  - Gambia: Banjul\n  - Germany: Berlin\n  - India: New Delhi\n  - Iran: Tehran\n  - Jordan: Amman\n  - Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur\n  - Nepal: Kathmandu\n  - Nigeria: Abuja\n  - Norway: Oslo\n  - Turkey: Ankara\n  - UAE: Abu Dhabi\n- Ignore grammatical variations (e.g., \"the Nigeria\" → treat as \"Nigeria\") if the fact is correct.\n- Any deviation → `False`.\n\n### Step 5: Apply Logical Operations with Safe Short-Circuiting\n- Precedence: `not` > `and` > `or`, but parentheses override.\n- Short-circuit only if:\n  - The entire sub-expression's value is determined (e.g., `False and X` → short-circuit to `False`).\n  - All negations within the sub-expression are fully simplified.\n- *When in doubt, evaluate all parts to avoid errors.*\n\n### Step 6: Step-by-Step Evaluation Protocol with Logging\n1. For each parentheses level (starting from innermost):\n   a. Simplify negations completely.\n   b. Compute arithmetic or verify facts.\n   c. Record the intermediate truth value in the log.\n2. Move outward level by level, using the log to substitute values.\n3. For deeply nested expressions, maintain a detailed log with numbered steps.\n\n### Step 7: Consistency Check and Re-evaluation\n- If multiple expressions seem True, re-evaluate with focus on:\n  - Negation counts in problematic expressions.\n  - Arithmetic precision (recompute step-by-step).\n  - Factual verification against the capital list.\n- Remember: Only one expression is True.\n\n### Step 8: Output Format\n- After complete evaluation, output only the correct label, e.g., `(C)`.\n\n### Critical Examples for Guidance (Learn from Common Errors):\n\n**Example 1 - Negation Depth and Isolation:**\nInput: `not not (not not not (True))`\nSimplify innermost: `not not not True` → `not True` (3 `not`s, odd)\nThen: `not not (not True)` → `not True` (2 `not`s on `not True` → even → identity)\nFinal: `not True` = `False`\n\n**Example 2 - Arithmetic with Negatives:**\nInput: `-8 / -2 * 3 + 1`\nStep 1: `-8 / -2 = 4`\nStep 2: `4 * 3 = 12`\nStep 3: `12 + 1 = 13`\n\n**Example 3 - Factual Accuracy and Variation:**\nInput: `(The capital of the Nigeria is Abuja.) and (The capital of Norway is Bergen.)`\nEvaluate: `True and False` = `False` (Ignore \"the\", but Bergen ≠ Oslo)\n\n**Example 4 - Short-Circuiting Safely:**\nInput: `False and (not not not (5 > 3))`\nSimplify negations first: `not not not (True)` → `not True` = `False`\nThen short-circuit: `False and False` → `False`\n\n**Example 5 - Nested Evaluation with Log:**\nInput: `not (not (5 > 3) or (2 * 2 = 4))`\nLevel 1: `5 > 3` = `True`\nLevel 1: `2 * 2 = 4` = `True`\nLevel 2: `not True` = `False`\nLevel 2: `False or True` = `True`\nLevel 3: `not True` = `False`\n\n**Example 6 - Common Pitfall (Misplaced Negation):**\nInput: `not (not not (8 > 5) and (10 < 2))`\nSimplify negations: `not not (8 > 5)` → `not not True` → `True`\nThen: `not (True and False)` = `not False` = `True`\n\nNow, evaluate the following expressions carefully using this enhanced protocol:",

Your task is to identify the correct one through meticulous, step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Guidelines:\n1. **String Literals**: Treat phrases like \"The capital of X is Y\" as boolean values: `True` if factually correct, `False` otherwise. Verify using your knowledge base. Key facts:\n   - Azerbaijan: Baku (not Ganja)\n   - Belarus: Minsk (not Grodno)\n   - Cameroon: Yaoundé (not Douala)\n   - Nigeria: Abuja (not Lagos)\n   - Armenia: Yerevan (not Gyumri)\n   - Others: Confirm if unsure.\n\n2. **Logical Simplification**:\n   - **Negation rules**: For `n` negations, result is `X` if `n` is even, `not X` if `n` is odd.\n     - `not not X` = `X`\n     - `not not not X` = `not X`\n     - Count carefully; modulo 2 reduction is critical.\n   - **Short-circuiting**: \n     - In `A and B`, if `A` is `False`, skip `B` (result is `False`).\n     - In `A or B`, if `A` is `True`, skip `B` (result is `True`).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Evaluation**:\n   - Compute arithmetic accurately: division yields floats; handle negatives correctly.\n   - `max` and `min`: Identify extreme values in lists, including negatives.\n   - Comparisons: \"is less than or equal to\" means `<=`, etc.\n\n4. **Evaluation Strategy**:\n   - **Innermost first**: Start from the deepest parentheses and move outward.\n   - **Subexpression labeling**: Evaluate each subexpression fully before outer use. Label intermediate results if needed.\n   - **Precedence**: `and` has higher precedence than `or` unless parentheses dictate otherwise.\n   - **Outermost last**: After inner evaluation, apply the outermost operation (e.g., leading `not`).\n\n5. **Consistency Check**: Only one expression is True. If multiple seem True, recheck negations, arithmetic, and facts.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid (with Examples):\n- **Negation miscount**: `not not not True` is `False`, not `True`. Example: In `not not not (2*5<=10)`, since `2*5<=10` is `True`, result is `False`.\n- **Factual error**: \"The capital of Azerbaijan is Ganja\" is `False` (Baku is correct). Verify all capitals.\n- **Arithmetic error**: `-9 / -1 = 9.0` (float), and `-5 - (-5/2) = -2.5` (not an integer). Double-check division and negatives.\n- **Short-circuiting missed**: In `False and (complex expression)`, skip the complex part.\n- **Outermost operation overlooked**: After evaluating inner to `True`, `not (True)` must be `False`. Example: In expression (A) of Example 1, the outer `not` was missed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Template:\nFor each expression:\n1. **Parse structure**: Identify innermost subexpressions and group with parentheses.\n2. **Simplify negations**: Reduce negation chains modulo 2.\n3. **Evaluate literals**: Check string facts; compute arithmetic and comparisons.\n4. **Apply logic**: Evaluate logical operations inner-to-outer, using short-circuiting.\n5. **Finalize**: Apply outermost operation.\n6. **Verify**: Only one expression is True. If conflict, recheck steps.\n\n### Examples for Guidance:\n**Example 1 (Error Prevention)**: \nIn expression (A) of a previous case, the model missed the outer `not` after inner evaluation. Always check the outermost operation.\n\n**Example 2 (Factual Check)**:\n\"The capital of Cameroon is Douala\" is `False` (Yaoundé is correct). When in doubt, verify.\n\n**Example 3 (Negation Chain)**:\nFor `not not not not True`, since 4 is even, result is `True`.\n\n**Example 4 (Short-circuiting)**:\nIn `True or (complex expression)`, skip the complex part—result is `True`.\n\nNow, analyze the given expressions systematically.

Apply aggressively.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Evaluation**:\n   - Compute arithmetic accurately: division yields floats; handle negatives correctly.\n   - `max` and `min`: Identify extreme values in lists, including negatives.\n   - Comparisons: \"is less than or equal to\" means `<=`, etc. Double-check comparisons involving negatives and floats.\n\n4. **Evaluation Strategy**:\n   - **Parentheses parsing**: Rewrite expressions with explicit parentheses if ambiguous. Assume precedence: `not` > `and` > `or`, but parentheses override.\n   - **Innermost first**: Start from the deepest parentheses and move outward.\n   - **Subexpression labeling**: Evaluate each subexpression fully before outer use. Label intermediate results clearly.\n   - **Outermost last**: After inner evaluation, apply the outermost operation (e.g., leading `not`).\n\n5. **Consistency Check**: Only one expression is True. If multiple seem True, re-check negations, arithmetic, and facts. Focus on common pitfalls.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid (with Examples from Failures):\n- **Negation miscount**: `not not not True` is `False`, not `True`. Example: In `not not not (2*5<=10)`, since `2*5<=10` is `True`, result is `False`.\n- **Factual error**: \"The capital of Azerbaijan is Ganja\" is `False` (Baku is correct). Verify all capitals.\n- **Arithmetic error**: `-9 / -1 = 9.0` (float), and `-5 - (-5/2) = -2.5` (not integer). Double-check division and negatives.\n- **Short-circuiting missed**: In `False and (complex expression)`, skip the complex part.\n- **Outermost operation overlooked**: After evaluating inner to `True`, `not (True)` must be `False`. Example: In expression (A) of Example 1, the outer `not` was missed.\n- **Parentheses misparsing**: In nested expressions, ensure correct grouping. Example: In Example 2, misparsing led to incorrect evaluation of (A).\n- **Floating-point precision**: Handle divisions carefully (e.g., `-9/2 = -4.5`). Use exact comparisons.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Template:\nFor each expression:\n1. **Parse structure**: Identify innermost subexpressions. Rewrite with explicit parentheses if needed.\n2. **Simplify negations**: Reduce negation chains modulo 2 immediately.\n3. **Evaluate literals**: Check string facts; compute arithmetic and comparisons.\n4. **Apply logic**: Evaluate logical operations inner-to-outer, using short-circuiting. Skip unnecessary evaluations.\n5. **Finalize**: Apply outermost operation.\n6. **Verify**: Only one expression is True. If conflict, re-check steps, focusing on negation counts and arithmetic.\n\n### Examples for Guidance (Failure Prevention):\n**Example 1 (Negation Chain)**: \nFor `not not not not True`, since 4 is even, result is `True`.\n\n**Example 2 (Short-circuiting)**:\nIn `True or (complex expression)`, skip the complex part—result is `True`.\n\n**Example 3 (Factual Check)**:\n\"The capital of Cameroon is Douala\" is `False` (Yaoundé is correct). When in doubt, verify.\n\n**Example 4 (Arithmetic Precision)**:\n`-9 / 2 = -4.5` (float), and `-4.5 <= -4` is `True`.\n\n**Example 5 (Outermost Operation)**:\nIn `not (True and False)`, inner is `False`, outer `not` gives `True`. Do not miss the outer `not`.\n\nNow, analyze the given expressions systematically. Proceed step by step, and ensure only one is True.",

Your task is to identify the correct one through meticulous, step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Guidelines:\n1. **String Literals**: Treat phrases like \"The capital of X is Y\" as boolean values: `True` if factually correct, `False` otherwise. Verify using your knowledge base. Key facts:\n   - Azerbaijan: Baku (not Ganja)\n   - Belarus: Minsk (not Grodno)\n   - Cameroon: Yaoundé (not Douala)\n   - Nigeria: Abuja (not Lagos)\n   - Armenia: Yerevan (not Gyumri)\n   - Canada: Ottawa (not Toronto)\n   - UAE: Abu Dhabi (not Dubai)\n   - Iran: Tehran (not Isfahan)\n   - Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur (not Putrajaya)\n   - Afghanistan: Kabul (not Kandahar)\n   - Others: Confirm if unsure. If uncertain, assume `False`.\n\n2. **Logical Simplification**:\n   - **Negation rules**: For any chain of `n` consecutive `not`s, result is `X` if `n` is even, `not X` if `n` is odd. Always simplify negation chains first before evaluating the inner expression.\n   - **Short-circuiting**: \n     - In `A and B`, if `A` is `False`, skip `B` entirely (result is `False`).\n     - In `A or B`, if `A` is `True`, skip `B` entirely (result is `True`).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Evaluation**:\n   - Compute arithmetic accurately: division yields floats; handle negatives correctly.\n   - `max` and `min`: Identify extreme values in lists, including negatives.\n   - Comparisons: \"is less than or equal to\" means `<=`, etc.\n\n4. **Evaluation Strategy**:\n   - **Rewrite First**: Begin by rewriting the entire expression with explicit parentheses to clarify operator precedence. Add parentheses to make all implicit groupings explicit.\n   - **Subexpression Labeling**: Break the expression into the smallest subexpressions. Label each (e.g., P1, P2, ...) and evaluate them in order from innermost to outermost.\n   - **Simplify Negations Early**: For any negation chain, reduce it immediately to its simplified form (e.g., `not not not X` becomes `not X`).\n   - **Precedence**: `not` has higher precedence than `and`, which has higher than `or`, unless parentheses dictate otherwise.\n   - **Short-Circuiting Apply**: When short-circuiting is triggered, skip the irrelevant subexpression and mark it as unevaluated.\n   - **Outermost Last**: After evaluating the inner expression, apply the outermost operation.\n\n5. **Consistency Check**: After evaluating all expressions, list each result. If multiple are `True`, systematically re-check each expression to find the error. Re-verify all factual string literals.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Template:\nFor each expression:\n1. **Parse and Rewrite**: Rewrite the expression with explicit parentheses for clarity.\n2. **Label Subexpressions**: Identify and label all subexpressions (P1, P2, ...).\n3. **Simplify Negations**: Reduce negation chains modulo 2 before evaluating inner expressions.\n4. **Evaluate Literals**: Check string facts; compute arithmetic and comparisons precisely.\n5. **Apply Logic**: Evaluate logical operations inner-to-outer, using short-circuiting where applicable.\n6. **Finalize**: Apply the outermost operation.\n7. **Verify**: Confirm only one expression is True. If conflict, re-check steps and facts.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid (with Examples):\n- **Negation miscount**: `not not not True` is `False`, not `True`. Example: In `not not not (2*5<=10)`, since `2*5<=10` is `True`, result is `False`.\n- **Factual error**: \"The capital of Azerbaijan is Ganja\" is `False` (Baku is correct). Verify all capitals.\n- **Arithmetic error**: `-9 / -1 = 9.0` (float), and `-5 - (-5/2) = -2.5` (not an integer). Double-check division and negatives.\n- **Short-circuiting missed**: In `False and (complex expression)`, skip the complex part.\n- **Outermost operation overlooked**: After evaluating inner to `True`, `not (True)` must be `False`.\n- **Precedence ambiguity**: `A and B or C` should be treated as `(A and B) or C`. Always clarify with parentheses.\n\n### Failure Examples for Guidance:\n**Example 1 (Deep Nesting Error)**:\nIn a previous case, the model miscounted negations in `not not not (not (not not (not not not (False))))` due to deep nesting. Always count carefully: 8 `not`s → even → `False`.\n\n**Example 2 (Factual Overlook)**:\n\"The capital of Malaysia is Putrajaya\" was evaluated but not re-checked in conflict. Always verify facts again if multiple expressions seem True.\n\n**Example 3 (Short-Circuiting Missed)**:\nIn `False and (1/0 == 0)`, the division by zero must be skipped. Evaluate only if needed.\n\n**Example 4 (Outermost Operation Missed)**:\nAfter inner evaluation to `True`, `not (True)` was forgotten, leading to incorrect `True`.\n\n**Example 5 (Arithmetic Error)**:\n`-3 - (-7 / -3)` was miscomputed as `-3 - 2.333 = -5.333`, not `-3 - 2.333 = -5.333` (correct). Show steps: `-7/-3≈2.333`, then `-3-2.333=-5.333`.\n\nNow, analyze the given expressions systematically. Proceed step by step, and ensure only one is True. For each expression, follow the template and avoid the common mistakes highlighted.",

Your task is to identify the correct one through meticulous, step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Guidelines:\n1. **Evaluation Order**:\n   - Always begin with the innermost parentheses and move outward systematically.\n   - For each subexpression, assign it a variable (e.g., P1, P2) to simplify tracking and reduce nesting confusion.\n   - Fully evaluate each subexpression before incorporating it into outer operations.\n\n2. **String Literals**:\n   - Treat phrases like \"The capital of X is Y\" as boolean values: `True` if factually correct, `False` otherwise.\n   - If uncertain about a fact, assume it is correct unless you are certain it is wrong (e.g., \"The capital of Nigeria is Abuja\" is True; \"Lagos\" is False).\n\n3. **Logical Simplification**:\n   - Simplify negations iteratively from the inside out:\n        `not not X` = `X`\n        `not not not X` = `not X`\n        (for longer chains, reduce modulo 2).\n   - Apply short-circuiting rigorously:\n        In `A and B`, if `A` is `False`, skip `B` and return `False`.\n        In `A or B`, if `A` is `True`, skip `B` and return `True`.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Evaluation**:\n   - Compute arithmetic operations accurately. Use exact fractions for division to avoid floating-point errors (e.g., treat `-3/7` as `-3/7`, not `-0.4286`).\n   - Evaluate `max` and `min` functions correctly.\n   - Interpret comparisons precisely: \"is less than or equal to\" as `<=`, etc.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:\n   - For each expression, decompose it into subexpressions and evaluate each part sequentially.\n   - After evaluating inner expressions, apply the outermost operation last.\n   - Document each step clearly to avoid errors.\n\n6. **Consistency Check**:\n   - Only one expression is True.

Simplify stepwise: `not not not True` → `not not False` → `not True` → `False`.\n- **Overlooking short-circuiting**:\n  Example: In `False and (complex expression)`, the result is `False` without evaluating the complex part.\n- **Arithmetic errors**:\n  Example: `max(-6,4,10,-5) - min(-6,4,10,-5) = 16` (not 1). Double-check such calculations.\n- **Factual errors**:\n  Example: \"The capital of Norway is Bergen\" is False (correct is Oslo). Verify all geographical facts.\n- **Misparsing grouping**:\n  Example: In `not (A and B)`, evaluate `A and B` first, then apply `not`.\n\n### Few-Shot Examples of Past Errors:\n**Example 1 (from previous failure)**:\n- Expression: `not not not (True)`\n- Incorrect evaluation: `True` (assuming `not not not X = X`)\n- Correct evaluation: `not not not True` → `not not False` → `not True` → `False`\n\n**Example 2 (from previous failure)**:\n- Expression: `False and (The capital of India is Mumbai)`\n- Incorrect evaluation: Evaluated both parts.\n- Correct evaluation: Short-circuit to `False` without evaluating the string literal.\n\n**Example 3 (from previous failure)**:\n- Expression: `-5 - (-3/7) > 4`\n- Incorrect evaluation: Used approximate decimal (-4.571 > 4 → False).\n- Correct evaluation: Use exact fraction: `-5 + 3/7 = -32/7 ≈ -4.571`, which is not > 4 → False.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Template:\nFor each expression:\n1.

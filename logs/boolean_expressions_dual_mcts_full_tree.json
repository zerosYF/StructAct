    "prompt": "You are an expert logic solver. Your task is to determine which one of the given boolean expressions evaluates to `True`.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1.  **Interpret the Syntax:**\n    *   Treat all phrases like `\"is greater than\"`, `\"is less than or equal to\"`, etc., as their standard Python operators: `>`, `<=`, etc.\n    *   Treat all statements about capitals (e.g., `\"The capital of Azerbaijan is Ganja.\"`) not as strings, but as boolean values. Determine their truth value based on real-world facts. For example, `\"The capital of Canada is Ottawa.\"` is `True`, while `\"The capital of Nigeria is Lagos.\"` is `False`.\n    *   `True` and `False` are literal boolean values.\n\n2.  **Simplification Rule:** Remember that multiple `not` operations cancel each other out. An even number of `not`s is equivalent to no operation. An odd number of `not`s is equivalent to a single `not`.\n\n3.  **Evaluation Strategy:**\n    a.  **Identify and Evaluate Innermost Expressions:** Start with the most deeply nested components, such as arithmetic calculations (`max(5, -8, -10, 10) - min(...)`), comparisons (`4 * -6 > -5`), and factual statements.\n    b.  **Substitute Values:** Replace these innermost expressions with their computed boolean results (`True`/`False`).\n    c.  **Apply Logical Operations:** Move outward, applying the `not`, `and`, and `or` operations to the simplified values from the previous step.\n    d.  **Repeat:** Continue this process of substitution and application until you have a single boolean value for the entire expression.\n\n4.  **Final Check:** Remember that according to the problem, only **one** of the options (A through E) will evaluate to `True`. If your initial analysis suggests more than one or zero are `True`, double-check your work, particularly your arithmetic and the truth values of capital statements.\n\n**Examples of Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n- **Incorrect Arithmetic:** Double-check calculations, especially with negative numbers and divisions (e.g., `-4 - (-5 / 1) = -4 - (-5) = 1`, not `-9`).\n- **Misapplying `not` Operations:** `not not not True` equals `not True` equals `False` (three `not`s = one `not`).\n- **Factual Errors:** Recall that the capital of Nigeria is Abuja, not Lagos. The capital of Cameroon is Yaoundé, not Douala.\n- **Ignoring the \"Only One True\" Constraint:** If you find zero or multiple `True` results, re-evaluate your steps.\n\nNow, analyze the following expressions step by step.

In Example 1, the model incorrectly evaluated (C) as true by missing that `not (X and False)` is always true, but failed to verify that (E) was also true due to short-circuiting errors.\n2. **Example 2 (Option E)**: Always compute arithmetic accurately (e.g., `-6 - (-10 / -3)` = `-6 - 3.333` = `-9.333`, not `-6 - (-3.333)`). Factual errors (e.g., \"The capital of Norway is Bergen\") must be caught early.\n3. **Example 4 (Option D)**: Simplify negations modulo 2 (e.g., `not not not X` ≡ `not X`). Watch for parentheses mismanagement in deeply nested expressions.\n4. **Example 5 (Option A)**: Use short-circuiting aggressively. For instance, `and (False)` should halt evaluation immediately.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Extract and cache factual claims** (e.g., capital cities) upfront. Assign truth values using common knowledge. Handle misspellings (e.g., \"the Nigeria\" means Nigeria) but mark as false if factually wrong.\n2. **Simplify negations** using modulo 2 reduction:\n   - Even number of `not`s: cancel out (e.g., `not not X` ≡ `X`).\n   - Odd number: equivalent to one `not` (e.g., `not not not X` ≡ `not X`).\n3. **Compute arithmetic** with PEMDAS order. Double-check signs and comparisons.\n4. **Break expressions recursively** from innermost parentheses outward. Use temporary variables for sub-expressions to track intermediate results.\n5. **Apply short-circuiting rigorously**:\n   - In `and` chains, if any sub-expression is false, the entire conjunction is false—stop immediately.\n   - In `or` chains, if any sub-expression is true, the entire disjunction is true—stop immediately.\n6. **Leverage anchors** (e.g., `False` in `and`, `True` in `or`) to prune evaluation early.\n7. **Verify only one true expression**: If multiple options appear true, recheck for missed short-circuiting, negation errors, or arithmetic mistakes.\n\n### Reasoning Guidance:\n- For highly nested expressions, prioritize evaluating sub-parts with known facts or simple arithmetic first.\n- If an expression seems overwhelming, focus on components that can determine the outcome quickly (e.g., contradictions).\n- Cross-reference factual claims against the cached list to ensure consistency.\n\nProceed step by step, justifying your reasoning clearly.

Key facts: \n        - Germany: Berlin (True), UAE: Abu Dhabi (False; not Dubai), Nigeria: Abuja (False; not Lagos), Cameroon: Yaoundé (False; not Douala), India: New Delhi (False; not Mumbai), Turkey: Ankara (False; not Istanbul), Iran: Tehran (True), Canada: Ottawa (True), Colombia: Bogotá (True).\n    *   `True` and `False` are literal boolean values.\n\n2.  **Simplification Rules:**\n    *   Multiple `not` operations: An even number cancels out (equivalent to no `not`). An odd number is equivalent to a single `not`.\n    *   Logical operations: `and` has higher precedence than `or` unless parentheses indicate otherwise. Remember short-circuiting: In an `or` chain, if any part is `True`, the result is `True`; in an `and` chain, if any part is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\n3.  **Evaluation Strategy:**\n    a.  **Innermost-First Evaluation:** Start with the most deeply nested components: arithmetic calculations (e.g., `max(5, -8, -10, 10) - min(...)`), comparisons (e.g., `4 * -6 > -5`), and factual statements. Compute these carefully, double-checking arithmetic with negative numbers and division.\n    b.  **Substitute Values:** Replace innermost expressions with their boolean results (`True`/`False`).\n    c.  **Apply Logical Operations:** Move outward, applying `not`, `and`, and `or` to the simplified values. Use parentheses to maintain correct grouping.\n    d.  **Repeat:** Continue substitution and application until you have a single boolean value for the entire expression.\n\n4.  **Final Check:** Only one expression (A through E) evaluates to `True`. If you find zero or multiple `True` results, re-check your work—especially arithmetic, factual accuracy, and `not` simplification.\n\n**Example Insight:** In a complex expression ending with `or (The capital of Canada is Ottawa.)` (which is `True`), the entire expression becomes `True` regardless of the preceding part due to short-circuiting. Leverage this to avoid unnecessary computation.\n\nNow, analyze the following expressions step by step.

Your task is to determine which one of the given boolean expressions evaluates to `True`.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1.  **Interpret the Syntax:**\n    *   Treat all phrases like `\"is greater than\"`, `\"is less than or equal to\"`, etc., as their standard Python operators: `>`, `<=`, etc.\n    *   Treat all statements about capitals (e.g., `\"The capital of Azerbaijan is Ganja.\"`) not as strings, but as boolean values. Determine their truth value based on real-world facts. For example, `\"The capital of Canada is Ottawa.\"` is `True`, while `\"The capital of Nigeria is Lagos.\"` is `False`.\n    *   `True` and `False` are literal boolean values.\n    *   Normalize minor typos (e.g., \"the Nigeria\" → \"Nigeria\").\n\n2.  **Simplification Rule:** Remember that multiple `not` operations cancel each other out. An even number of `not`s is equivalent to no operation. An odd number of `not`s is equivalent to a single `not`. Explicitly count the `not`s and apply this rule.\n\n3.  **Evaluation Strategy:**\n    a.  **Add Parentheses for Clarity:** First, rewrite the expression with explicit parentheses to make the grouping unambiguous.\n    b.  **Identify and Evaluate Innermost Expressions:** Start with the most deeply nested components: arithmetic calculations (`max(5, -8, -10, 10) - min(...)`), comparisons (`4 * -6 > -5`), and factual statements.\n    c.  **Substitute Values:** Replace these innermost expressions with their computed boolean results (`True`/`False`).\n    d.  **Apply Logical Operations:** Move outward, applying the `not` (using the simplification rule), `and`, and `or` operations to the simplified values.\n    e.  **Repeat:** Continue this process until you have a single boolean value for the entire expression.\n\n4.  **Arithmetic Checks:** For arithmetic calculations, compute step-by-step. Use parentheses to ensure correct order of operations. Double-check calculations involving negative numbers and division.\n\n5.  **Final Check:** Remember that according to the problem, only **one** of the options (A through E) will evaluate to `True`. After evaluating all, if you have more than one or zero `True`, double-check your work, particularly arithmetic and capital facts.\n\n**Examples of Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n- **Incorrect Arithmetic:** Double-check calculations, especially with negative numbers and divisions (e.g., `-4 - (-5 / 1) = -4 - (-5) = 1`, not `-9`).\n- **Misapplying `not` Operations:** `not not not True` equals `not True` equals `False` (three `not`s = one `not`).\n- **Factual Errors:** Recall that the capital of Nigeria is Abuja, not Lagos. The capital of Cameroon is Yaoundé, not Douala.\n- **Ignoring the \"Only One True\" Constraint:** If you find zero or multiple `True` results, re-evaluate your steps.\n\n**Example Evaluation for Guidance:**\nConsider a simplified example: `not (not (5 > 3) and (max(1,2) - min(1,2) <= 1))`\n- Step 1: Add parentheses: `not ( (not (5 > 3)) and ( (max(1,2) - min(1,2)) <= 1 ) )`\n- Step 2: Evaluate innermost: `5 > 3` → `True`; `max(1,2)=2`, `min(1,2)=1`, difference=`1`, `1 <= 1` → `True`\n- Step 3: Substitute: `not ( (not True) and True )` → `not ( False and True )` → `not (False)` → `True`\n- Final: `True`\n\nNow, analyze the following expressions step by step.

Remember: `not not not False` = `not (not (not False))` = `not (not True)` = `not False` = `True`.\n*   **Example 2 Error:** The model computed `10 - (-1 / -5)` correctly as `9.8` but then made an error in the logical grouping of `and` and `or` operations. Always count parentheses carefully.\n*   **Example 3 Error:** The model misremembered that the capital of Belarus is Minsk, not Grodno.

Exclude ambiguous items like \"pennywhistles\" or \"balafons\" unless clearly musical.\n- **Fruits**: Edible fruits (e.g., apples, grapes, berries, melons, citrus).

            "prompt": "You are given a paragraph describing various objects owned by different people. Your task is to compute the quantity requested in the question.\n\nFollow these steps precisely:\n\n1.  **Focus on the Relevant Owner:** Carefully scan the entire text. Only consider items explicitly stated as owned by the person mentioned in the question (e.g., \"I\", \"my aunt\"). Ignore all items owned by others, even if they are mentioned in the same sentence.\n\n2.  **Extract and Categorize:** For each item the owner has:\n    *   Identify the object and its final stated quantity (ignore all backstories and explanations).\n    *   Classify it into the correct category based on the question (e.g., \"musical instruments\", \"mobiles\", \"fruits\", \"cars\"). Use your knowledge and these guidelines:\n        *   If the item name contains a category word (e.g., \"apple\", \"piano\", \"iPhone\"), use that for classification. (\"Electric piano\" is a musical instrument, \"pink lady apple\" is a fruit).\n        *   If a word is a likely misspelling of a known item (e.g., \"tars\" for \"tar\", a lute), classify it as the intended item. Do not ignore items due to spelling uncertainty.\n\n3.  **Ignore Explanatory Text:** Do not recalculate quantities from stories or explanations. Use only the final number provided (e.g., \"18 xylophones\").\n\n4.  **Calculate Sums:** Create two separate lists of all quantities for each category. Sum the quantities in each list in a single calculation (e.g., `Total_Cars = 5 + 10 + 3 = 18`) to minimize arithmetic errors.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Operation:** Apply the requested operation (e.g., \"sum\", \"absolute difference\") to the two totals. For \"difference\", subtract the smaller number from the larger one to get the absolute value.\n\nPresent your final answer within `<answer>` tags.\n\n**Examples of correct reasoning:**\n\n[Example 1 - Handling spelling and classification]\nInput: \"I have 8 tars (received them last month).\"\nQuestion: \"musical instruments and cars\"\nReasoning: \"tars\" is likely a misspelling of \"tar\", a Persian lute, which is a musical instrument. Quantity: 8. Not a car.\n\n[Example 2 - Comprehensive extraction]\nInput: \"My mother has 51 electric drums. I also have 45 cantaloupes.\"\nQuestion: \"fruits and cars\"\nReasoning: The sentence starts with \"My mother\", but the clause \"I also have 45 cantaloupes\" is about the relevant owner. \"Cantaloupes\" are a fruit. Quantity: 45.\n\n[Example 3 - Single-calculation summation]\nInput: \"I have 10 cars, 20 cars, and 5 cars.\"\nQuestion: \"cars\"\nReasoning: Total_Cars = 10 + 20 + 5 = 35. Not 10+20=30, 30+5=35.\n\nThis prompt is designed to prevent common errors such as missing items due to sentence structure, misclassifying items due to spelling or compound names, and making arithmetic mistakes in long sums.",

Your task is to judge the relationship between a Premise and a Hypothesis.\n\n**Guidelines:**\n- Always assume the **Premise is true**.\n- An **entailment** means that based on the information in the Premise, a person would **necessarily and reasonably** conclude the Hypothesis is true. **You must use common-sense reasoning and world knowledge.**\n- **Crucially: Do not invent far-fetched or hyper-skeptical scenarios to avoid entailment. Base your reasoning on the most natural and likely interpretation of the statements.**\n- A **non-entailment** means the Hypothesis **could plausibly be false** even if the Premise is true. **If you can imagine a realistic, everyday situation where the Premise is true and the Hypothesis is false, it is non-entailment.**\n\n**Specific Rules for Beliefs and Verbs:**\n- **If a person believes/knows/suspects that someone else has learned, realized, knows, or remembers a fact, you can infer that they also believe/suspect that fact itself.** This is a pragmatic necessity for coherent communication.\n- **Pay attention to verbs that entail truth:** Verbs like \"learns,\" \"knows,\" \"realizes,\" and \"remembers\" imply that the information in their clause is true. For example, \"X learns that P\" means P is a fact.\n\n**Analysis Format:**\n1.  **Premise:** [Insert Premise]\n2.  **Hypothesis:** [Insert Hypothesis]\n3.  **Reasoning:** Explain step-by-step whether the Hypothesis follows from the Premise. **First, state the most natural interpretation. Then, check if a realistic alternative exists.**\n4.  **Final Answer:** Clearly state your one-word judgment: `entailment` or `non-entailment`.\n\nNow, analyze the following:\n**Premise:** [Premise]\n**Hypothesis:** [Hypothesis]",

Remember: factive verbs commit their subject to the truth of their complement clause.\n\n2. **Map belief perspectives:** Represent the nested belief structure. The premise is a narrator's statement about mental states. When the premise is true, this means the narrator's description of beliefs is accurate - not that the belief contents are necessarily true in reality.\n\n3. **Apply factivity correctly:** A factive verb's truth commitment applies only within the perspective of its immediate subject. It does not project truth to higher belief holders or the narrator unless those holders use factive verbs.\n\n4. **Key embedding principle:** For structure `A [non-factive] that B [factive] that P`, this entails `A [non-factive] that P` because the factive verb is part of the believed content. The attitude applies to the entire proposition \"B factively-verbs P.\"\n\n5. **Judge entailment:** Ask: \"If the narrator's premise statement is true, does it logically force the narrator's hypothesis statement to be true?\" Use linguistic semantics of verbs but ignore external world knowledge about event plausibility.\n\n**Critical examples for reference:**\n- Premise: \"Ava believes Evelyn recognizes P\" → does NOT entail \"Evelyn recognizes P\" (Ava could be wrong about Evelyn)\n- Premise: \"Richard suspects Michael understands P\" → DOES entail \"Richard suspects P\" (suspicion encompasses the understood content)\n- Premise: \"Olivia assumes Taylor learns P\" → DOES entail \"Olivia assumes P\" (assumption includes the learned content)\n\nNow analyze:\nPremise: {premise}\nHypothesis: {hypothesis}\nReasoning:",

It also does not entail what another agent believes, unless the premise explicitly states it.\n\n3.  **Factive Verbs (Knowledge, Understanding):** Verbs like `knows`, `understands`, and `realizes` imply that the agent's belief is true.\n    *   **Internal Exportation:** The content of a knowledge claim can be exported *one level outward*. For example, \"X knows that P\" entails \"P\". \"Ava believes that Emma knows that P\" entails \"Ava believes that P\".\n\n4.  **Nested Contexts:** Apply these rules recursively from the outermost context inward.\n    *   The outermost verb defines the primary context for the entire premise.\n    *   To entail a hypothesis, you must be able to logically derive it within this primary context, using the rules above.\n\n**How to Apply the Rules:**\n1.  Identify the outermost mental state verb in the Premise.\n2.  For the Hypothesis to be entailed, it must be a logical consequence *within the scope of that outermost verb*.\n3.

This means you must accept the information it presents as factual.\n- **Critical Rule for Beliefs and Modals:** If the Premise states that a person *believes*, *thinks*, *says*, or *knows* something, this **only guarantees that the belief, thought, or claim itself exists.** It does **not** guarantee that the factual content of that belief/claim is true in the world. Words like \"might,\" \"could,\" or \"probably\" also do not guarantee that something is factually true.\n- **Rule for Nested Beliefs and Claims:** When the Premise contains nested statements (e.g., \"A believes that B knows X\"), you **can and should** make inferences about the beliefs and knowledge of the persons mentioned. For example, \"A believes that B knows X\" entails that \"A believes that B believes X\", because \"knowing\" implies \"believing\". However, it does **not** entail that \"B actually knows X\" or that \"X is true\". Focus on the logical relationships between the mental states (believe, know, think, say) of the different subjects.\n- **Definition of Entailment:** An **entailment** means that if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis **must necessarily also be true**. There is no possible scenario where the Premise is true but the Hypothesis is false. Consider only the logical connections based on the information given.\n- **Definition of Non-Entailment:** A **non-entailment** means that the Hypothesis **could be false** even if the Premise is true. The Premise may suggest the Hypothesis but does not guarantee it.\n\n**Analysis Format:**\n1.  **Premise:** [Insert Premise]\n2.  **Hypothesis:** [Insert Hypothesis]\n3.  **Reasoning:**\n    - First, identify all belief verbs (believe, know, think, etc.), their subjects, and the structure of the statement (e.g., is it nested?).\n    - Apply the \"Critical Rule\": Separate the existence of a belief from the **factual truth** of its content.\n    - Apply the \"Rule for Nested Beliefs\": Determine what the Premise tells us about the beliefs of each subject mentioned.\n    - Determine if the truth of the Premise logically forces the Hypothesis to be true. If there is any doubt or any possible way the Hypothesis could be false, it is non-entailment.\n4.  **Final Answer:** Clearly state your one-word judgment: `entailment` or `non-entailment`.\n\nNow, analyze the following:\n**Premise:** [Premise]\n**Hypothesis:** [Hypothesis]",

Accept all information it presents as factual.\n- **Critical Rule for Beliefs and Modals:**\n    - If the Premise states that a person *believes*, *thinks*, *says*, *knows*, *recognizes*, etc., something, this **only guarantees the existence of that mental state or claim, not that its content is objectively true in the world.**\n    - **However, for the purpose of logical analysis, you must fully accept the internal structure and meaning of the stated content.** A complex belief (e.g., \"X and Y are Z\") can and **must** be decomposed into its logical parts. The believer necessarily believes each component of a conjunctive fact.\n- **Definition of Entailment:** An **entailment** means that if the Premise is true, the Hypothesis **must necessarily also be true**. There is no possible scenario where the Premise is true but the Hypothesis is false.\n- **Avoid Invalid Counterexamples:** Consider only **reasonable and direct** interpretations of the text. Do not invent far-fetched, hyper-literal scenarios that violate the standard meaning of the words and the clear intent of the statement to create false doubt. **If the Premise describes a scenario, accept the most natural interpretation of that scenario.**\n- **Strict Implication:** Base your judgment only on the logical connections from the information given. **Do not use external world knowledge to add missing information that is not implied, but also do not use it to undermine the clear meaning of what is stated.**\n\n**Analysis Format:**\n1.  **Premise:** [Insert Premise]\n2.  **Hypothesis:** [Insert Hypothesis]\n3.  **Reasoning:**\n    - First, identify any belief states, modal verbs, or other qualifiers.\n    - Apply the \"Critical Rule for Beliefs and Modals\": Separate the existence of a belief from the truth of its content in reality, but accept the content's internal logic.\n    - **Decompose the statements:** Break down both the Premise and Hypothesis into their core logical components. Check if the components of the Hypothesis are contained within the Premise.\n    - Determine if the truth of the Premise logically forces the Hypothesis to be true.

If the topic involves a chromosomal disorder (e.g., Klinefelter, Down syndrome), you MUST apply the **Specialized Genetics Sub-Routine** at Step 5. For all other topics, proceed with the standard clinical reasoning.\n\n**Step 2: Clinical Summary & Red Flag Analysis**\nSummarize the key patient details, symptoms, signs, and history. **Crucially, identify and highlight any 'red flag' findings** that are atypical for a common diagnosis (e.g., fixation of a mass, rapid progression, constitutional symptoms, unusual demographics). These flags are critical for identifying exceptions.\n\n**Step 3: Diagnosis and Differential Considerations**\nState the most likely diagnosis. Explain your reasoning. **If red flags are present, explicitly consider and justify alternative 'zebra' diagnoses.** Do not anchor prematurely on the most common condition. Briefly note key differentials to rule out.\n\n**Step 4: Question Objective**\nDetermine what the question is specifically asking (e.g., the next step, the best test, the underlying mechanism, the initial metastatic site).\n\n**Step 5: Specialized Sub-Routine or Standard Evaluation**\n*   **A. SPECIALIZED GENETICS SUB-ROUTINE:** **ONLY APPLY THIS IF** the question involves a chromosomal disorder.\n    *   **Genetic Origin:** State the classic karyotype and specify the parental origin of the abnormality if provided.\n    *   **Mechanism Analysis:** Analyze how nondisjunction in gametogenesis can produce the abnormal gamete.

STANDARD SYSTEMATIC OPTION EVALUATION:** For all other topics.\n    *   For each answer choice:\n        *   Explain its general medical purpose or definition.\n        *   Justify why it is indicated or not indicated for *this specific patient*. For diagnostic tests, consider cost-effectiveness and whether the result would change initial management.\n    *   **Troubleshooting:** If your evaluation leads to a conclusion that seems to conflict with the expected answer, **reconsider your diagnosis.** Ask: *\"What disease or condition would make this seemingly incorrect option the right answer?\"* Then, re-evaluate the clinical summary for evidence of that disease.\n\n**Step 6: Answer Choice Semantics Check**\n**Critically examine the nature of the answer choices.** Note if any choices describe a *mechanism* or *route* of a process (e.g., a blood vessel for spread, an enzyme for a reaction) rather than a *destination* or *outcome* (e.g., a lymph node, a metabolic product). If the question's phrasing (e.g., \"metastatic site\") seems to conflict with the correct mechanistic option, the question is likely testing an exception. Resolve this conflict by prioritizing the biological reality over a literal interpretation of the question's wording.\n\n**Step 7: Conclusion**\nSynthesize your evaluation to select the single best answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Examples of Reasoning**\n\n**Example 1: Standard Clinical Reasoning (Correct)**\n[Question: A 64-year-old male presents with bilateral knee pain...]\n*   **Topic:** Diagnostics/Rheumatology.\n*   **Clinical Summary:** An older male with activity-related knee pain, minimal morning stiffness, bony enlargement, crepitus, and cool joints. *Red Flags: None identified.*\n*   **Diagnosis:** Classic osteoarthritis (OA).

For MRI: Not routinely indicated. Does not change initial conservative management.\n*   **Semantics Check:** All options are tests or a logical conclusion; no semantic conflicts.\n*   **Conclusion:** No further work-up is needed.\n*   <answer>E</answer>\n\n**Example 2: Exception Handling (Learn from Failure)**\n[Question: A 48-year-old female with a fixed, immobile thyroid nodule...]\n*   **Topic:** Endocrinology/Oncology. *Genetics sub-routine not applicable.*\n*   **Clinical Summary:** ... *Red Flag: The nodule is \"fixed\" and \"immobile,\" which is a sign of local invasion and is highly atypical for common papillary cancer.*\n*   **Diagnosis:** The fixed nature overrides commonality. This suggests an aggressive carcinoma (e.g., anaplastic) with a propensity for **hematogenous spread**, not lymphatic.\n*   **Question Objective:** The most likely initial metastatic site.\n*   **Standard Evaluation:** Options include anatomical sites (A, B, C, E) and a vascular route (D: Inferior thyroid arteries).\n*   **Semantics Check:** **Crucial Step.** Option D is a *route* (vascular invasion), not a *destination site*. In a question asking for a \"metastatic site,\" this is a signal the question is testing the *mechanism* of spread for an aggressive cancer. For a cancer that spreads via blood, invasion into the inferior thyroid arteries is the initial step to reach distant sites (lungs/bones).\n*   **Conclusion:** For this aggressive, invasive cancer, the initial step in metastasis is vascular invasion.\n*   <answer>D</answer>\n\n---\n\nFinally, output your final answer within the tags <answer></answer>.",

Use this structured reasoning process:\n\n**GENERAL PRINCIPLE:** The strongest epidemiological risk factors (e.g., smoking, immunosuppression, age) must be the primary drivers of your differential diagnosis. Do not allow suggestive but non-specific findings (e.g., nodule location, demographic trends) to override the absence of a major risk factor. Always align your final answer with the gold standard of care and the most common presentation for the patient's specific risk profile.\n\n**1. Topic Identification:** Identify the core medical topic (e.g., pulmonary nodule, toxicology, genetics). Explicitly list the key epidemiological risk factors relevant to this topic.\n\n**2. Clinical Summary:** Summarize the key patient details, symptoms, signs, and history. Explicitly note the presence AND, crucially, the absence of critical risk factors and 'red flag' symptoms.\n\n**3. Risk Factor Analysis:** Rank the patient's risk factors from strongest to weakest based on medical evidence. This analysis must anchor your entire differential diagnosis. For example: \"The strongest risk factor is the absence of smoking, which makes squamous and small cell carcinomas less likely. Other factors include age, race, and symptoms like weight loss.\"\n\n**4. Diagnosis:** State the most likely diagnosis. Explain your reasoning by directly referencing your Risk Factor Analysis. Briefly note key differentials to rule out, justifying why they are less likely based on the predominant risk factor profile.\n\n**5. Question Objective:** Determine what the question is specifically asking (e.g., the next step, the best test, the underlying mechanism, the most likely diagnosis). If the question asks for the \"first\" test, ensure your choice aligns with standard medical protocols and is not merely a preliminary component of a more comprehensive test.\n\n**6. Systematic Option Evaluation:** For each answer choice:\n*   Explain its general medical purpose.\n*   **Relationship to Other Options:** Note if this test is a standard component or precursor of another listed option (e.g., a dipstick is part of a urinalysis).\n*   Justify why it is indicated or not indicated for *this specific patient*, based primarily on alignment with the Risk Factor Analysis from step 3.\n*   **For diagnostic tests:** Consider value and standard of care. Prioritize the test that provides the most definitive and actionable information to confirm or rule out the primary concern. Do not recommend a preliminary test if a more comprehensive one is the established protocol.\n\n**7. Critical Sanity Check:** Before concluding, perform a final review.\n*   **If the question is about diagnosis:** Ask: 'Does my chosen diagnosis best explain the entire clinical picture and is it strongly supported by the predominant risk factors? Is there a more common diagnosis for this patient's specific risk profile that I have discounted?'\n*   **If the question is about management (e.g., next test):** Ask: 'Would a proficient clinician order this test first in this scenario based on standard guidelines, or is a different option the actual standard?

Which diagnosis? Options included squamous cell carcinoma (D) and adenocarcinoma (E)]\n*   **Error:** Choosing D (Squamous cell carcinoma). The reasoning overemphasized the nodule's apical location and the patient's demographic while underweighting the paramount negative risk factor: the absence of smoking. Squamous cell carcinoma is overwhelmingly a disease of smokers.\n*   **Correct Approach:** The strongest risk factor is that the patient is a non-smoker. Adenocarcinoma is the most common lung cancer in non-smokers, women, and younger patients. While location can be suggestive, it is not pathognomonic. The diagnosis must align with the major risk profile. The correct answer is E (Adenocarcinoma).\n\n**Example of Incorrect Reasoning to Avoid (Failure Analysis - Test Order):**\n[Question: A 55-year-old construction worker with a high-voltage electrical injury presents with flank pain...

The initial diagnosis of SCID was flawed because it ignored the contradictory finding of significant lymphadenopathy (atypical for classic SCID) and underweighted the major epidemiological risk factor (no prenatal care/home birth). The correct diagnosis is congenital HIV. The best test to confirm this is PCR for viral genes (D) to detect HIV RNA/DNA.\n*   **Correct Approach:** The presence of lymphadenopathy should have triggered a re-evaluation of the differentials, strongly favoring HIV over SCID.

Always use the options as clues and acknowledge the limitation of not seeing the image.\n*   **Example 2 (SCID Infant):** The infant was unstable (fever, tachycardia, hypotension). The question asked for the test to \"confirm the diagnosis.\" The gold standard was PCR for viral genes (D) to identify the acute, life-threatening opportunistic infection, not TREC analysis (E) for the underlying SCID. In an unstable patient, always prioritize diagnosing and treating the acute complication first.\n\n**Example of Correct Reasoning for an Unstable Patient:**\n[Question: The 3-month-old girl from Example 2...]\n*   **0. Acuity Assessment:** **Unstable.** Fever (38.5°C), tachycardia (155/min), tachypnea (45/min), hypotension (88/50 mm Hg). This indicates sepsis/shock.

Diagnosis:** Underlying condition is likely Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). The acute, life-threatening complication is **sepsis and pneumonia (likely opportunistic)**.\n*   **4. Question Objective:** In this unstable patient, the question \"which is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\" is asking for the test that will **identify the causative pathogen of the acute sepsis** to guide immediate antimicrobial therapy.\n*   **5. Option Evaluation:**\n    *   **D (PCR for viral genes):** **Indicated.** This is a rapid molecular test that can identify viruses like CMV or adenovirus, which are common causes of pneumonia and sepsis in immunocompromised infants. A positive result would directly change acute management (e.g., start ganciclovir).\n    *   **E (TREC analysis):** Not indicated for acute management. This is a definitive test for the underlying SCID but is a send-out test. Its result does not change the immediate treatment of sepsis.\n*   **6.

The most dangerous action can sometimes be unnecessary intervention.**\n\n**STEP 4: REALITY CHECK & DISEASE-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE**\nBefore finalizing, perform a sanity check:\n*   Does this answer make sense for the patient's age, history, and presentation?\n*   Is this aligned with the highest-yield fact for this condition? (e.g., For paternal-origin Klinefelter, error is in primary spermatocyte; for HS, most common complication is gallstones/cholecystitis).\n*   Have I been tricked into over-complicating a simple scenario?\n\n**CRITICAL FAILURE AVOIDANCE:**\nExplicitly consider and avoid these reasoning errors:\n*   **FAILURE (Pituitary):** A patient with bitemporal hemianopia and erectile dysfunction does not necessarily have a gonadotroph adenoma. Erectile dysfunction in a young man is a classic sign of hyperprolactinemia from a **lactotroph** adenoma. Do not over-prioritize mass effect and ignore key hormonal clues.\n*   **FAILURE (Pediatrics):** Do not conflate language and motor delays. A 12-month-old walking independently but not following a complex command can be normal.\n*   **FAILURE (Triage):** A question asking \"which diagnosis should be excluded first?\" is **not** asking for the least likely diagnosis. It is a command to identify the most dangerous possibility you must urgently rule out. For example, a calcified gallbladder mass mandates excluding cancer first, not a benign condition.\n*   **FAILURE (Genetics):** For a paternal-origin 47,XXY karyotype, the non-disjunction error occurs in **Meiosis I (Primary Spermatocyte)**. Do not over-complicate the genetics; recall this high-yield fact.\n*   **FAILURE (Benign Findings):** A yellow, cystic mass at the cervical os in an asymptomatic patient with normal Paps is a **Nabothian cyst** and requires no intervention. Do not biopsy classic benign findings.\n*   **FAILURE (Complications):** The most common complication of hereditary spherocytosis is **pigment gallstones and cholecystitis**, not splenic sequestration (which is typical of sickle cell disease). Know the classic complications of common diseases.\n\n**STEP 5: FINAL ANSWER**\nAfter completing the correct reasoning process and reality check, state your final answer clearly.\n<answer>[LETTER]</answer>",

                "prompt": "As an expert AI medical consultant, your reasoning must be guided by a sophisticated understanding of clinical context, with particular emphasis on integrating the patient's age into every aspect of your diagnostic process.\n\n**STEP 1: CONTEXT & AGE INTEGRATION**\nRead the question thoroughly. Your first task is to classify the clinical context:\n*   **IF** the question is explicitly about **developmental milestones** (e.g., motor, language, social skills in infants/children), proceed to the **DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONE REASONING** process (Step 2A).\n*   **FOR ALL OTHER MEDICAL QUESTIONS,** you must apply a **GENERAL, AGE-SPECIFIC CLINICAL REASONING** process (Step 2B). The patient's age is a **primary diagnostic filter** and must never be disregarded. A presentation in a neonate, child, adult, or elderly patient dictates completely different differential diagnoses and complications.\n\n**STEP 2A: DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONE REASONING**\nIf triggered, analyze the developmental milestones using this strict process:\n1.  Identify each child's demonstrated skills and note any missing skills that are often listed in options.\n2.  Recall the standard age ranges (CDC, Denver II) for these milestones, emphasizing that normal development is a spectrum.\n3.  Prioritize the most definitive motor milestones (e.g., independent walking) to resolve conflicts in age estimation.\n4.  The core principle: Your final assessment must be \"developmentally normal.\" A missing skill must be one that is commonly absent at that age, not a concerning omission.\n5.  Test each potential age answer: Eliminate options if a child has a skill that is too advanced for that age or lacks a skill that is virtually mandatory for that age.\n\n**STEP 2B: AGE-SPECIFIC CLINICAL REASONING**\nFor all non-developmental questions, employ this diagnostic framework, meticulously tailoring it to the patient's age:\n1.  **Synthesize the Presentation:** List all key findings. **Scrutinize every lab value and physical sign for its age-specific meaning** (e.g., a normal MCHC in an anemic child points toward hereditary spherocytosis, not thalassemia; splenomegaly in a 3-year-old suggests congenital hemolysis or infection, not lymphoma).\n2.  **Identify Pathognomonic Clues:** Highlight the most specific clinical feature. **Immediately contextualize it: \"Is this finding classic for a condition that is prevalent in this age group or demographic?\"**\n3.  **Generate an Age-Appropriate Differential:** Determine the disease process that explains the entire constellation. **Your differential must be rooted in the epidemiology of the patient's age group** (e.g., jaundice in a child: think congenital hemolytic anemia; in an adult: think hepatocellular or obstructive causes).\n4.  **Apply Epidemiological Likelihood:** Base your final diagnosis on the **most common cause for the given presentation, age, and demographic.** (e.g., The most common complication of chronic hemolysis is cholecystitis from pigment stones; splenic sequestration is a rarer, acute complication of specific diseases like sickle cell).\n5.  **Rule Out Alternatives Critically:** Systematically evaluate why the correct answer is superior. **Ask: \"Is this distractor a common complication of my leading diagnosis for this age group? Does the patient's profile make it more or less likely?\"**\n\n**CRITICAL FAILURE AVOIDANCE:**\nTo prevent recurring errors, explicitly consider and avoid these reasoning pitfalls:\n*   **FAILURE (Age-Blind Anchoring):** Do not anchor on a common adult diagnosis for a pediatric case, or vice versa. A 3-year-old with jaundice and splenomegaly is not likely to have cholecystitis from gallstones secondary to cirrhosis, but is highly likely to have a congenital hemolytic anemia. Conversely, new jaundice in a 60-year-old mandates ruling out malignancy before considering benign causes.\n*   **FAILURE (Hematology - Misattributing Demographics):** Do not assume sickle cell disease for every African American child with hemolytic anemia. A **normal MCHC is a classic feature of hereditary spherocytosis.** The most common long-term complication of any chronic hemolytic anemia is **cholecystitis** due to pigment stone formation.\n*   **FAILURE (Pituitary - Misinterpreting Clues):** A patient with bitemporal hemianopia and erectile dysfunction does *not* necessarily have a gonadotroph-derived tumor. Erectile dysfunction in a young man is a classic sign of hyperprolactinemia from a **lactotroph**-derived adenoma. Do not over-prioritize mass effect and ignore key hormonal clues.\n*   **FAILURE (Developmental - Confusing Domains):** Do not mistake a language delay for a motor delay.

Your reasoning process is dictated by this domain classification.\n\n**STEP 1: DOMAIN CLASSIFICATION**\nRead the question thoroughly. Determine the primary medical specialty:\n*   If the question is **primarily** about identifying or assessing **developmental milestones in infants or children** to determine age or normalcy, proceed to the **SPECIALIZED PEDIATRIC REASONING** process (Step 2A).\n*   For **all other medical questions** (e.g., endocrinology, neurology, cardiology, pharmacology), you must **DISREGARD THE PEDIATRIC FRAMEWORK ENTIRELY** and proceed to the **GENERAL CLINICAL REASONING** process (Step 2B).\n\n**STEP 2A: SPECIALIZED PEDIATRIC REASONING (Developmental Milestones Only)**\nIf triggered, analyze the developmental milestones using this strict process:\n1.  **Inventory Skills:** List all demonstrated and reported skills for each child across all domains: gross motor, fine motor, language (expressive and receptive), and social/adaptive.\n2.  **Reference Standard Ages:** Recall the standard age ranges (CDC, AAP) for each milestone. Remember that normal development is a spectrum, but focus on the ages by which 90% of children achieve a skill.\n3.  **Identify Constraining Milestones:** To estimate age, prioritize milestones that have the **narrowest age windows** and for which the **absence of an expected skill is a strong indicator of delay**. The *lack of a skill that >90% of peers have* is a more powerful constraint than the *presence of an advanced skill*.\n4.  **Core Principle - Normalcy First:** The final assessment is \"developmentally normal.\" Therefore, for a given age option, if the child lacks a skill that >90% of children that age have, that option is invalid. A child can have skills that are advanced for their age and still be normal.\n5.  **Test Each Option Systematically:** Evaluate every potential age answer. Eliminate an option if:\n    *   The child **lacks a skill** that is **virtually mandatory** (>90% of children that age have achieved it).\n    *   The child demonstrates a skill that is **highly advanced** (<10% of children that age can do it) *unless it is the only option that satisfies the \"normalcy\" constraint for all other skills*.\n\n**STEP 2B: GENERAL CLINICAL REASONING (All Other Questions)**\nIf the question is non-developmental, employ this standard diagnostic framework:\n1.  **Synthesize the Presentation:** List all key findings: symptoms, signs, imaging, and lab results.\n2.  **Identify Pathognomonic Clues:** Highlight the most specific and definitive clinical feature (e.g., bitemporal hemianopia points to a sellar mass).\n3.  **Pathophysiological Mechanism:** Determine the disease process that best explains the entire constellation of findings. Do not fixate on a single symptom in isolation.\n4.  **Apply Epidemiological Likelihood:** Base your final diagnosis on the most common cause for the given presentation and demographic. (e.g., Prolactinoma is the most common functioning pituitary adenoma).\n5.  **Rule Out Alternatives:** Systematically evaluate why the correct answer is more likely than the distractors. Avoid the trap of misattributing mass effects (e.g., hypopituitarism from compression) to the cell type of origin.\n\n**CRITICAL FAILURE AVOIDANCE:**\nTo prevent errors, explicitly consider these examples of flawed reasoning. These are not just examples; they are rules to follow:\n*   **FAILURE EXAMPLE (Pituitary):** A patient with bitemporal hemianopia and erectile dysfunction does *not* necessarily have a gonadotroph-derived tumor. Erectile dysfunction in a young man is a classic sign of hyperprolactinemia, most commonly from a **lactotroph**-derived adenoma. Hypogonadism can also result from compression by any large tumor, but the absence of other hypersecretion symptoms makes prolactinoma most likely. Do not over-prioritize mass effect and ignore the key hormonal clue.\n*   **FAILURE EXAMPLE (Pediatrics - Confusion):** Do not mistake a language delay for a motor delay. A 12-month-old walking independently but not following a complex command can be normal.\n*   **NEW FAILURE EXAMPLE (Pediatrics - Weighting):** Do not prioritize motor milestones over language milestones. A child taking independent steps but unable to follow a simple command like \"grab the ball\" is more likely a **12-month-old** (a common age for walking who *should* understand commands) than a **9-month-old** (an uncommon age for walking who *would not* be expected to understand commands). The absence of the expected language skill is a more powerful constraint than the presence of the advanced motor skill. Always seek the interpretation that aligns with the most common developmental trajectory.\n\n**STEP 3: FINAL ANSWER**\nAfter completing the correct reasoning process for the identified domain, state your final answer clearly.\n\n<answer>[LETTER]</answer>",

Note any \"cannot yet do\" items, interpreting them carefully: distinguish between a true absence of understanding (concerning) and a skill that is emerging or not consistently performed (normal).\n\n2.  **Establish Age Ranges:** For each skill, recall the typical age range of acquisition. Remember that normal development exists on a spectrum, and children can be at different points on this spectrum for different skills.\n\n3.  **Identify Hard Constraints:**\n    *   A **Lower Bound** is set by the presence of an advanced skill (e.g., independent walking implies ≥9 months).\n    *   An **Upper Bound** is set by the absence of a foundational, mandatory milestone for a given age (e.g., no social smile by 3 months is a red flag). The absence of such a skill is a stronger, more definitive constraint than the presence of an advanced one.\n\n4.  **Resolve Conflicts:** If milestones suggest conflicting ages, prioritize the constraint that indicates a potential delay. **The absence of a mandatory milestone for an age group vetoes that age, even if other skills are advanced.** For example, a child cannot be 12 months old if they cannot sit independently, even if they have advanced language.\n\n5.  **Final Validation for Normalcy:** The final assessment is that all children are \"developmentally normal.\" Your chosen ages must fit within the bounds from step 3.

This is a repeat failure of output formatting. The reasoning is correct, but the final answer is wrong, rendering the entire response incorrect. The output must be: </answer>E</answer>.\n\n[Example: Chest X-ray - Misapplication of Knowledge]\n*   **Error:** The model reasoned that \"decreased tactile fremitus\" and a \"deep sulcus sign\" were signs of atelectasis, leading to the choice of D.\n*   **Correction:** The correct answer is E (Blunting of costophrenic angle). Gold standard knowledge states that decreased tactile fremitus is a classic sign of pleural effusion, not atelectasis. The \"deep sulcus sign\" is a sign of pneumothorax on a supine film, not atelectasis. The most likely finding for an effusion is blunting of the costophrenic angle. When in doubt, default to bedrock clinical definitions.\n\n[Example: Previous Failure - Pituitary Adenoma]\n*   **Error:** Overlooked hyperprolactinemia as the most direct cause of erectile dysfunction and misattributed symptoms to a non-functioning tumor.\n*   **Correction:** The correct answer is B (Lactotrophs).

The epidural anesthetic directly causes a sympathetic nerve block, leading to vasodilation and a drop in systemic vascular resistance. This is the immediate and sufficient mechanism for the acute hypotension. Aortocaval compression is a constant predisposing factor but is not the cause of the acute change.\n*   **Key Point:** For a complication of a procedure, the direct effect of the procedure is the answer.\n\n[Example: Miglitol - Reinforcing Direct Mechanism]\n*   **Scenario:** A diabetes drug taken with the first bite of a meal.\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Outputting an answer that does not match a correct analysis.\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The correct answer is **B (Glycosidic bonds)**. Miglitol is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. Its direct and sole mechanism is to inhibit enzymes in the small intestine that cleave glycosidic bonds in carbohydrates. All other bond types are unrelated to this drug's action.\n*   **Key Point:** For pharmacology questions, the answer is always the drug's direct molecular target or mechanism. The final output must match the analysis.\n\n[Example: Opioid Overdose - Pattern Recognition]\n*   **Scenario:** Coma, hypoventilation, miosis, and acute respiratory acidosis.\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** Selecting COPD exacerbation despite a normal bicarbonate level ruling out chronicity.\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The correct answer is **E (Opioid overdose)**. This is the only option that directly explains the entire pattern: central respiratory depression (causing acute hypercapnic acidosis), coma, and pinpoint pupils (miosis). A normal bicarbonate confirms this is an acute process, ruling out chronic conditions like COPD.\n*   **Key Point:** Let the data rule options out.

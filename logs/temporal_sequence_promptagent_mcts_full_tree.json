Your task is to find the longest possible meeting that can be scheduled for a group of participants, given their weekly schedules and specific constraints.\n\n**Reasoning Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Process Global Constraints First:** Before analyzing schedules, identify all constraints that affect which days or times are viable. For example:\n    *   Note any participants who only accept meetings on specific days.\n    *   Note any hard time boundaries (e.g., \"must end before 4pm\").\n    *   Note any timezone differences and convert all schedules to a common time.\n\n2.  **Interpret Flexibility Rules Precisely:**\n    *   \"Can clear meetings of M minutes\" means the participant can cancel a pre-existing appointment of duration <= M minutes. The new meeting can be scheduled in this cleared time slot, but its duration cannot exceed the length of the cleared slot unless it is adjacent to another free period.\n    *   \"Can miss at most M minutes\" means the total duration of the meeting that overlaps with the participant's busy time must be <= M minutes.\n    *   \"Must have T minutes free after\" means the participant must be completely free from the meeting's end time until T minutes after the end time.\n    *   If no flexibility is stated, a participant must be completely free for the entire meeting duration.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Effective Free Time:** For each viable day and for each participant, combine their stated free times with any slots they can clear using their flexibility rule. This creates a set of \"effective free intervals\" for each person.\n\n4.  **Find Common Availability:** For each viable day, find the intersection of all participants' effective free intervals. These are the candidate time blocks where a meeting could theoretically occur.\n\n5.  **Apply Meeting Constraints:** For each candidate block, apply the remaining meeting-specific constraints (e.g., start on hour/half-hour, minimum or maximum length rules, required free time after). Determine the longest possible meeting duration (X) that can be scheduled within each block.\n\n6.  **Calculate X and Y:**\n    *   **X** is the maximum possible meeting length (in minutes) that can be scheduled on any day.\n    *   **Y** is the number of distinct start times (on the hour or half-hour) where a meeting of length **exactly X** can be scheduled.\n\n7.  **Output Format:** Report X and Y as two integers separated by a comma (e.g., `90, 2`). If no meeting is possible, output `0, 0`.\n\n**Avoid Common Mistakes:**\n-   Do not assume a participant has flexibility unless it is explicitly stated.\n-   Do not forget to apply day-specific constraints before analyzing a day's schedule.\n-   Do not brute-force every start time. First find common free blocks, then apply the start-time rule.\n\n**Example Analysis (Few-Shot):**\n\n**Example 1 Error:** The model incorrectly extended Yolanda's free time by clearing a block. The correct approach is to treat the cleared block as a new, isolated free interval of 15 minutes (from 12:40 to 12:55) and then see if it can be connected to her adjacent free period (which starts at 12:55). This means she is free from 12:40 to 17:00, not because the block was \"cleared\" but because it connects to an existing free block.\n\n**Example 3 Error:** The model initially forgot that Olivia only accepts meetings on Tuesday and Friday and wasted time analyzing Monday. Always list day-restrictions first.\n\nNow, apply this precise reasoning process to the following problem:\n[Insert the specific problem here]",

Your task is to find the longest possible meeting that can be scheduled for a group of participants, given their weekly schedules and specific constraints.\n\n**Reasoning Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Process Global Constraints First:**\n    *   Identify day restrictions: Note any participants who only accept meetings on specific days (e.g., \"only on Tuesday\"). If a participant \"prefers\" a day but does not explicitly say \"only,\" do not assume exclusion of other days.\n    *   Note hard time boundaries (e.g., \"must end before 4pm\" means the meeting must end by 15:59).\n    *   Convert all schedules to a common time if timezone differences exist.\n\n2.  **Interpret Flexibility Rules Precisely:**\n    *   \"Can clear meetings of M minutes\": The participant can cancel a pre-existing appointment of duration ≤ M minutes. This creates a new free interval. If this cleared block is adjacent to an existing free period, merge them into a continuous interval.\n    *   \"Can miss at most M minutes\": The participant must be free from (meeting end time - M) to the end time. They do not need to be free at the start time.\n    *   \"Must have T minutes free after/before\": The participant must be completely free for T minutes immediately after/before the meeting (within work hours).\n\n3.  **For Each Viable Day:**\n    *   Synthesize effective free intervals for each participant by combining their stated free times with any flexibility rules.\n    *   Find the intersection of all participants' effective free intervals. These are the candidate blocks where a meeting could occur.\n    *   For each candidate block, apply meeting constraints: start on the hour or half-hour, and any minimum/maximum length rules. Determine the longest possible meeting duration (X_day) that can be scheduled within the block, and the number of start times (Y_day) that allow a meeting of exactly X_day.\n\n4.  **Compare Across Days:**\n    *   After analyzing all days, the global X is the maximum X_day over all days.\n    *   The global Y is the sum of Y_day over all days where X_day = global X.\n\n5.  **Output Format:** Report X and Y as two integers separated by a comma (e.g., `90, 2`).

Claire \"prefers short meetings on Mondays and Thursdays\" but does not say \"only,\" so other days should be considered. Similarly, Rachel \"prefers long meetings on Tuesdays and Fridays\" but may accept other days. Always check the exact wording.\n\n**Example 2 Error:** The model found a long meeting on Monday but did not verify if another day had a longer one. Always compare across all days to find the global maximum.\n\n**Example 5 Error:** The model mishandled \"can miss the last 10 minutes.\" For Isabella, this means she must be free from (end time - 10) to end time, not necessarily at the start.

Correct approach: For a busy period from A to B, adjacent free intervals can be extended by up to M minutes into the busy time. For example, if free until 9:35 and busy from 9:35-10:20, with M=10, the effective free interval becomes 9:00-9:45 (extending 10 minutes into the busy time).\n\n**Example 2 Error:** The model forgot to apply \"must have T minutes free after\" during meeting constraint validation.

                "prompt": "You are an expert scheduling assistant. Your task is to find the longest possible meeting that can be scheduled for a group of participants, given their weekly schedules and specific constraints.\n\n**Reasoning Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Process Global Constraints First:**\n    *   **Day Restrictions:** Immediately identify and list all participants who only accept meetings on specific days. **Only analyze these days. Discard all other days.**\n    *   **Hard Time Boundaries:** Identify any hard end time constraints (e.g., \"must end before 4pm\"). The meeting cannot exceed the earliest such boundary.\n    *   **Timezone Conversion:** Convert all schedules to a common timezone (the base time of the majority). Adjust workday boundaries accordingly. For example, a participant one hour ahead working 9-5 their time has an effective workday of 8-4 in common time. **Always cap a participant's free intervals at their adjusted workday boundaries.**\n    *   **Other Global Rules:** Note any other rules that apply globally (e.g., minimum meeting length requirements for specific days).\n\n2.  **Synthesize Effective Free Intervals for Each Participant on Each Viable Day:**\n    *   **Base Free Intervals:** Extract free intervals from each participant's schedule for the day. **Assume all intervals are half-open: [start, end), meaning inclusive of the start time and exclusive of the end time.**\n    *   **Apply Flexibility Rules:**\n        *   **\"Can clear meetings of M minutes\":** For each busy block of duration <= M minutes, remove it. If the cleared time is adjacent to an existing free block, merge them into a single, continuous free interval.\n        *   **\"Can miss at most M minutes\":** For a free block [a, b], you can extend it into adjacent busy time. The total extension (the amount of new overlap created) must be <= M minutes. **To avoid complexity, prefer extending in one direction.** For example, extend the start time backward to `a - x` where `x = min(M, duration_of_adjacent_busy_before)`, OR extend the end time forward to `b + y` where `y = min(M, duration_of_adjacent_busy_after)`. Only extend in both directions if `x + y <= M`.\n    *   **Do NOT apply \"must have T minutes free before/after\" at this stage.** These will be applied later to candidate meeting times.\n    *   **Cap all intervals** at the participant's effective workday in the common timezone.\n\n3.  **Find Common Free Blocks:** For each viable day, find the intersection of all participants' effective free intervals. These are the candidate time blocks where a meeting could theoretically occur.\n\n4.  **Determine Longest Meeting (X) and its Count (Y):**\n    *   For each candidate block, iterate over all valid meeting start times within the block that are on the **hour or half-hour**.\n    *   For each start time `S`, calculate the maximum possible meeting duration `D` such that the meeting `[S, S+D)`:\n        *   Fits entirely within the common free block.\n        *   Ends by the earliest hard time boundary (e.g., 4:00 PM).\n        *   Satisfies all remaining constraints for every participant:\n            *   **\"Must have T minutes free before/after\":** For a participant with this rule, the entire interval `[S - T, S]` (free before) or `[S+D, S+D+T]` (free after) must be within their effective free intervals. **Check this now; do not synthesize it into the intervals earlier.**\n            *   Any day-specific length constraints (e.g., \"at least 30 minutes\").\n    *   Track the maximum `D` found across all start times and all days. This is `X`.\n    *   Count how many distinct start times (on the hour/half-hour) yield a meeting of this exact length `X`. This is `Y`.\n\n5.  **Output Format:** Report `X, Y` as two integers separated by a comma (e.g., `90, 2`). If no meeting is possible, output `0, 0`.\n\n**Avoid Common Mistakes:**\n-   **Day Restrictions:** Do not analyze a non-viable day. If a participant only accepts meetings on Tuesday, do not consider Monday.\n-   **Timezone Workday Capping:** A participant's availability in the common timezone ends at their adjusted workday end time. Do not include time beyond this, even if their schedule shows \"anytime after\".\n-   **Interval Boundaries:** Remember the [start, end) convention. A participant is free at 10:00 but not at 10:30 if their interval is [10:00, 10:30).\n-   **Start Time Rule:** The meeting must start on the hour or half-hour (e.g., 9:00, 9:30, 10:00). You must check all such start times within a common free block to find the maximum possible duration.\n-   **Flexibility Rules:** Do not assume flexibility where it is not stated. For \"can miss M minutes\", the total overlap for the entire meeting must be <= M, not per busy block.\n\n**Example Analysis (Few-Shot):**\n\n**Example 1 Error (Handling Flexibility):**\n*   **Problem:** The model incorrectly extended Yolanda's free time by clearing a block. The correct approach is to treat the cleared block as a new, isolated free interval of 15 minutes (from 12:40 to 12:55) and then see if it can be connected to her adjacent free period (which starts at 12:55). This means she is effectively free from 12:40 to 17:00.\n*   **Lesson:** When applying \"can clear,\" check for adjacency to existing free blocks to create a longer continuous interval.\n\n**Example 2 Error (Timezone Conversion):**\n*   **Problem:** The model converted Charlotte's schedule but failed to adjust her workday boundaries. Although her schedule was converted to common time, the model did not cap her availability at 4:00 PM (common time) because her workday ended at 5:00 PM *her time*.\n*   **Lesson:** When converting timezones, the participant's workday in the common timezone is shifted. A 9-5 worker one hour ahead has a common time availability of 8-4. You must cap their free intervals at 4:00 PM.\n\n**Example 3 Error (Day Restrictions):**\n*   **Problem:** The model initially forgot that Olivia only accepts meetings on Tuesday and Friday and wasted time analyzing Monday.\n*   **Lesson:** Always list and adhere to day-restrictions first. Immediately discard non-viable days.\n\n**Example 4 Error (Synthesizing \"Can Miss M Minutes\"):**\n*   **Problem:** The model did not synthesize Nancy's effective free time using her \"can miss 10 minutes\" rule. It treated her flexibility as a separate check per meeting, instead of creating a longer effective free interval by extending into her busy time by up to 10 minutes.\n*   **Lesson:** For \"can miss M minutes,\" create new effective free intervals by extending existing free intervals into adjacent busy periods, limited by M minutes of total added overlap.\n\n**Example 5 Error (Applying Free-Before Rule):**\n*   **Problem:** The model tried to apply Yolanda's \"10 minutes free before\" rule while synthesizing her effective free intervals, which is inefficient and error-prone.\n*   **Lesson:** Synthesize effective free intervals without \"free before/after\" rules. Apply these rules later when testing specific candidate start times within a common free block.\n\nNow, apply this precise reasoning process to the following problem:\n[Insert the specific problem here]",

Your task is to find the longest possible meeting that can be scheduled for a group of participants, given their weekly schedules and specific constraints.\n\n**Reasoning Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Process Global Constraints First:**\n    -   **Identify Viable Days:** Immediately determine the set of common days where all participants can attend. List any participants who only accept meetings on specific days. If there is no common day, output `0, 0` and stop.\n    -   **Timezone Conversion:** Convert all schedules to a common timezone (the base time of the majority). Adjust workday boundaries: e.g., if a participant is one hour ahead and works 9-5 their time, their effective workday in common time is 8-4. Cap their availability at these boundaries.\n    -   **Hard Time Boundaries:** Identify any hard time boundaries (e.g., \"must end before 4pm\") and apply them when synthesizing free intervals.\n\n2.  **Interpret Flexibility Rules Precisely and Synthesize Effective Free Time:**\n    -   For each participant, combine their stated free times with the effects of their flexibility rules to create a set of \"effective free intervals\" for the day.\n    -   **\"Can clear meetings of M minutes\":** The participant can cancel a pre-existing appointment of duration <= M minutes. Treat the cleared time as a new free block. If this block is adjacent to an existing free period, merge them into a single, continuous free interval.\n    -   **\"Can miss at most M minutes\":** The participant can attend a meeting even if it overlaps with their busy time, as long as the total duration of the overlap is <= M minutes. To synthesize their effective free time, extend their free intervals into adjacent busy periods, but only to the extent that the total added overlap from the extension would be <= M. *Example: If free from 10:00-11:00 and busy from 11:00-11:20, and M=10, the effective free interval becomes 10:00-11:10.*\n    -   **\"Must have T minutes free before/after\":** For \"free before\", a meeting can only start at time T if the participant is free from [T - T_minutes, T]. Similarly for \"free after\", the meeting must end by a time such that the participant is free for T minutes afterwards. Adjust the effective free intervals accordingly by shifting boundaries inward by T minutes.\n\n3.  **Find Common Availability:** For each viable day, find the intersection of all participants' effective free intervals. These are the candidate time blocks where a meeting could theoretically occur.\n\n4.  **Apply Meeting Constraints:** For each candidate block:\n    -   List all valid start times (on the hour or half-hour) within the block.\n    -   For each start time, determine the maximum meeting duration that fits within the block and satisfies all constraints (e.g., end time boundaries).\n    -   The meeting must satisfy all remaining constraints (e.g., end time boundaries, minimum length rules).\n    -   Determine the longest possible meeting duration (X) that can be scheduled within each block by testing valid start times.\n\n5.  **Calculate X and Y:**\n    -   **X** is the maximum possible meeting length (in minutes) that can be scheduled on any day.\n    -   **Y** is the number of distinct start times (on the hour or half-hour) where a meeting of length **exactly X** can be scheduled.\n\n6.  **Output Format:** Report X and Y as two integers separated by a comma (e.g., `90, 2`). If no meeting is possible, output `0, 0`.\n\n**Avoid Common Mistakes:**\n-   Do not assume a participant has flexibility unless it is explicitly stated.\n-   Do not forget to apply day-specific constraints before analyzing a day's schedule. If a participant only accepts meetings on Tuesday, do not waste time analyzing Monday.\n-   Do not brute-force every start time. First find common free blocks, then apply the start-time rule to these blocks.\n-   Remember that the meeting must end by the earliest time among all participants' constraints (e.g., if one person must leave by 4:00 PM, the meeting cannot go past this time, even if others are free later).\n-   For \"can miss M minutes,\" remember this applies to the total overlap duration for the entire meeting, not per busy block. Synthesize this into effective free intervals correctly.\n-   After timezone conversion, always cap availability at the effective workday boundaries.\n\n**Example Analysis (Few-Shot):**\n\n**Example 1 Error (Day Restrictions):**\n*   **Problem:** The model initially forgot that Olivia only accepts meetings on Tuesday and Friday and wasted time analyzing Monday.\n*   **Lesson:** Always list and adhere to day-restrictions first.

It treated her flexibility as a separate check per meeting, instead of creating a longer effective free interval by extending into her busy time by up to 10 minutes.\n*   **Lesson:** For \"can miss M minutes,\" create new effective free intervals by extending existing free intervals into adjacent busy periods, limited by M minutes.\n\n**Example 4 Error (Overlooking End Constraints):**\n*   **Problem:** The model initially overlooked Isabella's \"10 minutes free after\" requirement, which reduced the meeting end time to 15:50 instead of 16:00.\n*   **Lesson:** Apply all end-time constraints when synthesizing free intervals. For \"free after\", reduce the free interval end time by T minutes.\n\n**Example 5 Error (Flexibility Rule Application):**\n*   **Problem:** The model struggled to correctly synthesize Lisa's \"can miss last 10 minutes\" into a continuous free interval.\n*   **Lesson:** For \"can miss last M minutes\", extend free intervals forward into adjacent busy periods by up to M minutes.

This yields the common free blocks for the group.\n   - Note: Participants who can stay late (e.g., until 18:00) may have free intervals extending beyond 17:00, but for common availability, cap at 17:00 unless all participants can stay late.\n\n5. **Evaluate Meeting Options**:\n   - For each common free block, consider all start times on the hour or half-hour within the block.\n   - For each start time S, determine the maximum end time E such that:\n        - All participants are free throughout [S, E) (accounting for flexibility rules).\n        - Any \"free time after\" constraints are satisfied (E + required minutes ≤ 17:00).\n        - Other constraints (e.g., \"end before 4pm\" means E < 16:00; \"min length\" or \"max length\" on certain days) are met.\n   - The meeting length is E - S (in minutes).\n\n6. **Track the Longest Meeting**:\n   - Across all days and start times, find the maximum meeting length X.\n   - Count the number of start times Y that achieve a meeting of length X.\n\n7. **Output**:\n   - Report X and Y separated by a comma (e.g., \"120, 2\"). If no meeting is possible, output \"0, 0\".\n\n### Important Notes:\n- Time intervals are always [start, end), meaning start is included but end is not (e.g., [9:00, 10:00) includes 9:00 but not 10:00).\n- Be meticulous with time zone conversions (subtract if ahead of common time, add if behind).\n- Ensure all constraints are satisfied simultaneously for each candidate meeting.\n- Prioritize finding the longest possible meeting; only consider start times that yield this maximum length for Y.\n- End times can be continuous (e.g., 15:59) and are not required to be on the hour/half-hour.\n- For \"end before 4pm\", the meeting must end strictly before 16:00 (e.g., 15:59 is allowed).\n- If a participant only accepts meetings on specific days, ignore other days. Additional constraints (e.g., min/max length) apply only on those days.\n- For \"clear\" rules: Do not pre-clear the schedule; instead, during meeting evaluation, if a meeting overlaps with a clearable block, treat that block as free for that meeting.\n\n### Examples of Common Mistakes to Avoid:\n- Incorrect time zone conversion (e.g., shifting in the wrong direction).\n- Misapplying flexibility rules (e.g., allowing missing the first part instead of the last).\n- Overlooking \"free time after\" constraints (e.g., allowing a meeting to end at 16:55 when 10 minutes free after requires end by 16:50).\n- Failing to adjust schedules for \"clear\" rules conditionally.\n- Not considering all days or all valid start times within common free blocks.\n- Capping end times at 15:30 instead of 15:59 for \"end before 4pm\".\n- Not checking the entire [S-X, S) interval for \"free time before\".\n\n### Few-Shot Examples for Reference:\n\n[Example 1: Handling \"End Before 4pm\"]\n- Constraint: \"End before 4pm\" means E < 16:00, so E ≤ 15:59 is valid.\n- Correct: A meeting from 15:00 to 15:59 (59 minutes) is allowed.\n- Incorrect: Capping at 15:30 (30 minutes) is wrong.\n\n[Example 2: Handling \"Miss Last 10 Minutes\"]\n- For a meeting [S, E), the participant must be free from S to max(S, E-10).\n- If E = 16:00 and X=10, they must be free from S to 15:50 (if S ≤ 15:50).\n\n[Example 3: Handling \"Miss First 10 Minutes\"]\n- For a meeting [S, E), the participant must be free from S+10 to E.\n- If S = 10:00 and E = 11:00, they must be free from 10:10 to 11:00.\n\n[Example 4: Time Zone Conversion]\n- Participant is 1 hour ahead: subtract 1 hour from all their times to convert to common time.\n\nNow, apply this reasoning to the given input.",

Meeting is 90 minutes long from 10:00.\n- Incorrect: They must be free from 10:00 to 11:20 (E - 10 = 11:20).\n- Correct: They must be free from 10:00 to max(10:00, 11:30 - 10) = 11:20.\n\n**Example 3 (Clear Rule Oversight):**\n- Input: Participant can clear meetings ≤30 minutes. Their schedule has a 20-minute booked block at 10:00–10:20.\n- Incorrect: Keep the booked block.\n- Correct: Remove the booked block; treat as free.\n\n**Example 4 (Free Time After Constraint):**\n- Input: Participant requires 10 minutes free after meeting. Meeting ends at 16:50.\n- Incorrect: Acceptable if free until 17:00 (only 10 minutes needed).\n- Correct: Must have free time until 17:00 (16:50 + 10 = 17:00 is allowed).\n\nNow, apply this reasoning to the given input.",

Determine the global earliest end time for the meeting based on all constraints (e.g., \"must end before T PM\", \"must have X minutes free after\").\n6. For each possible start time (on hour/half-hour), determine the maximum meeting duration that satisfies all constraints (e.g., end time limits, free time after, flexibility rules). Consider that flexibility rules may extend some participants' free times.\n7. Track the maximum duration X and count how many start times yield that duration.\n\nOutput only the final answer as \"X, Y\" (e.g., 45, 3). If no meeting is possible, output \"0, 0\".\n\n**Examples to avoid common mistakes:**\n\n- Example 1: For \"must have 10 minutes free after\", if a participant is free until 5:00 PM (exclusive), the meeting must end by 4:50 PM to allow 10 minutes of free time (from 4:50 to 4:59).\n- Example 2: For \"can miss the last 10 minutes\", if a participant is free until 3:00 PM, the meeting can end at 3:10 PM, but they must be present until 3:00 PM.\n- Example 3: For timezone conversion, if Mary is one hour ahead, her 9:00 AM is 8:00 AM in base time. Adjust her schedule accordingly and intersect with the base workday (9 AM to 5 PM). Ignore any converted times outside 9-5.\n- Example 4: When checking start times, ensure the meeting is entirely within adjusted free intervals or accounted for by flexibility rules. Also ensure the start time is on the hour or half-hour.\n- Example 5: If a participant \"accepts meetings only on Monday if they are at most 60 minutes\", then they do not accept meetings on other days. On Monday, the meeting must be ≤60 minutes.\n\n**Failure Case Examples:**\n- Example A: Eve only accepts meetings on Tuesday and Friday, while Rachel only accepts on Monday and Thursday. No common day exists, so output \"0, 0\".\n- Example B: Sarah is one hour ahead. Her 9:05-9:35 becomes 8:05-8:35 in base time, which is outside 9-5, so ignore it.\n- Example C: Isabella requires 10 minutes free after. If she is free until 5:00 PM, the meeting must end by 4:50 PM. Combine this with Eve's requirement to end before 4:00 PM (end ≤15:59). The meeting must satisfy the most restrictive end time.",

This applies only to existing bookings, not to the meeting being scheduled.\n   - If no booking exists in the clearable window, no action is needed.\n\n3. **Determine Free Intervals**:\n   - For participants with \"Booked\" schedules: free time is the complement of the booked intervals within the workday (9:00-17:00).\n   - For participants with \"Free only at\" schedules: use only the listed intervals, intersected with 9:00-17:00.\n   - Apply flexibility rules to extend free intervals where allowed:\n     - If they \"can miss the last X minutes\", the meeting can end up to X minutes after their free time ends, but they must be free until (end time - X minutes). This effectively extends their availability by X minutes at the end of each free block.\n     - If they \"are fine to stay until T PM\", their availability extends to T:00 (e.g., until 17:59 for 6 PM).\n   - Note: Do not extend beyond the common workday (17:00) unless explicitly allowed by \"stay until\" rules.\n\n4. **Apply Conditional Day Constraints**:\n   - If a participant \"accepts meetings only on certain days if they are at least/most Y minutes\", then on those days, the meeting must satisfy the duration constraint. On other days, they do not accept meetings unless otherwise specified.\n   - Check day validity early: if any participant does not accept meetings on a day, skip that day.\n\n5. **Other Constraints**:\n   - If they \"must have X minutes free after\", the meeting must end at least X minutes before the end of their free time or their workday (5 PM), whichever is earlier.\n   - If they \"must have X minutes free before\", the meeting start time S must have [S-X, S] fully within their free time.\n   - Lunch breaks or other unavailable periods should be excluded from free intervals.\n\n6. **Find Valid Days and Overlaps**:\n   - For each day (Monday to Friday), determine if all participants accept meetings (consider day constraints).\n   - For each valid day, find all overlapping free intervals for all participants after applying the above rules.\n\n7. **Check Start Times**:\n   - The meeting must start on the hour or half-hour (e.g., 9:00, 9:30, ..., 16:30) within the common workday.\n   - For each candidate start time S (from 9:00 to 16:30, on the hour/half-hour):\n     - Ensure S is within the free interval of all participants.\n     - Check any \"must have free time before\" constraints: [S-X, S] must be within a free interval for the participant.\n     - For the meeting duration D, the interval [S, S+D) must be within the free intervals of all participants, accounting for flexibility rules (e.g., \"can miss last X minutes\" allows the meeting to end up to X minutes after free time ends).\n     - Ensure all other constraints are satisfied (e.g., end time limits, duration constraints).\n   - For each S, compute the maximum possible D that satisfies all constraints.\n\n8. **Track Maximum Duration**:\n   - Across all days and start times, find the longest possible meeting duration X.\n   - Count how many start times Y yield this duration X.\n\n9. **Output**:\n   - Output only the final answer as \"X, Y\" (e.g., \"60, 2\"). If no meeting is possible, output \"0, 0\".\n\n### Examples to Avoid Common Mistakes:\n- **Example 1**: For \"must have 10 minutes free after\", if a participant's free time ends at 17:00, the meeting must end by 16:50 to allow 10 minutes within work hours.\n- **Example 2**: For \"can miss the last 10 minutes\", if a participant is free until 15:00, the meeting can end at 15:10, but they must be present until 15:00.\n- **Example 3**: When converting timezones, if Mary is one hour ahead, her 9:00 AM becomes 8:00 AM in base time. Adjust her schedule accordingly.\n- **Example 4**: When checking start times, ensure the meeting is entirely within adjusted free intervals or accounted for by flexibility rules. For instance, a start time must be delayed if a participant requires free time before.\n\n### Additional Guidance:\n- Use a timeline approach (e.g., in minutes from 9:00) to simplify interval calculations.\n- Prioritize day-level constraints first to avoid unnecessary processing.\n- Remember that the meeting must end by 17:00 unless a participant can stay later (e.g., \"fine to stay until 6 PM\" allows until 18:00, but others may have earlier limits).\n\nReason step by step following the above steps.

On other days, they do not accept meetings.\n\n1. **Timezone Conversion**:\n   - Convert all schedules to a common reference time (base timezone).\n   - If a participant is explicitly stated to be one hour ahead, subtract one hour from their schedule.\n   - If a participant is explicitly stated to be one hour behind, add one hour.\n   - If no timezone is mentioned, assume base timezone.\n   - After conversion, truncate all intervals to the workday [9:00, 17:00). Discard any parts outside this range.\n\n2. **Apply \"Clear\" Rules**:\n   - If a participant \"can clear meetings of Z minutes or less\", remove any existing booking that is ≤Z minutes within the specified window. Only applies to existing bookings, not the meeting being scheduled.\n   - For participants with \"free only\" schedules, the booked intervals are the complement of the listed free intervals within [9:00,17:00). Apply clear rules to these booked intervals.\n   - If no booking exists in the clearable window, no action is needed.\n\n3. **Determine Free Intervals**:\n   - For participants with \"Booked\" schedules: free time is the complement of the booked intervals within [9:00, 17:00).\n   - For participants with \"Free only at\" schedules: use only the listed intervals, intersected with [9:00, 17:00). Handle \"anytime before X\" as [9:00, X) and \"anytime after Y\" as [Y, 17:00).\n   - Do not extend free intervals for flexibility rules at this stage.\n   - Merge overlapping intervals for each participant to form contiguous blocks.\n\n4. **Apply Individual Constraints**:\n   - For \"must have X minutes free before\": For a start time S, the interval [S-X, S] must be fully within a free interval. This may restrict valid start times.\n   - For \"must have X minutes free after\": The meeting must end at E such that [E, E+X) is within a free interval and within [9:00, 17:00).\n\n5. **Find Common Free Intervals**:\n   - For each valid day, find all overlapping free intervals for all participants after applying the above rules.\n   - Consider representing the day as a timeline from 0 to 480 minutes (9:00=0, 17:00=480). For each participant, mark free segments. Then find segments where all participants are free.\n\n6. **Check Start Times**:\n   - The meeting must start on the hour or half-hour (e.g., 9:00, 9:30, ..., 16:30). Convert these to minutes: 0, 30, 60, ..., 450.\n   - Only consider start times that lie within the common free intervals for that day.\n   - For each candidate start time S in the common free interval:\n     - Ensure S is within the free interval of all participants.\n     - Check \"must have free before\" constraints: [S-X, S] must be within a free interval for the participant.\n     - For the meeting duration D, the interval [S, S+D) must be within the common free interval, accounting for flexibility rules (e.g., \"can miss last X minutes\" allows the meeting to end at T+X, provided the participant is free until T).\n     - Check \"must have free after\" constraints: [S+D, S+D+X) must be within a free interval.\n     - Ensure all other constraints are satisfied (e.g., end time limits, duration constraints).\n     - The meeting end time must be within [9:00,17:00) unless a participant can stay later. However, if any participant cannot stay beyond 17:00, the meeting must end by 17:00.\n     - Compute the maximum possible D for each S.\n\n7. **Track Maximum Duration**:\n   - Across all days and start times, find the longest possible meeting duration X.\n   - Count how many start times Y yield this duration X.\n\n8. **Output**:\n   - Output only the final answer as \"X, Y\" (e.g., \"60, 2\"). If no meeting is possible, output \"0, 0\".\n   - Do not output any reasoning or intermediate steps.\n\n### Examples to Avoid Common Mistakes:\n- **Example 1**: For \"must have 10 minutes free after\", if a participant's free time ends at 17:00, the meeting must end by 16:50 to allow 10 minutes within work hours.\n- **Example 2**: For \"can miss the last 10 minutes\", if a participant is free until 15:00, the meeting can end at 15:10, but they must be present until 15:00.\n- **Example 3**: When converting timezones, if Mary is one hour ahead, her 9:00 AM becomes 8:00 AM in base time. Adjust her schedule and truncate to [9:00,17:00).\n- **Example 4**: When checking start times, ensure the meeting is entirely within adjusted free intervals or accounted for by flexibility rules. For instance, a start time must be delayed if a participant requires free time before.\n- **Example 5**: If a participant does not accept meetings on a day (e.g., only on Tue/Fri), skip that day immediately to avoid unnecessary processing.\n\n### Additional Guidance:\n- Use a timeline in minutes from 9:00 (e.g., 9:00 = 0, 10:00 = 60, ..., 17:00 = 480) to simplify interval calculations.\n- Prioritize day-level constraints first to avoid unnecessary processing.\n- Remember that the meeting must end by 17:00 unless a participant can stay later (e.g., \"fine to stay until 6 PM\" allows until 18:00, but others may have earlier limits).\n- Double-check that start times are strictly on the hour or half-hour (0, 30, 60, ..., 450). Avoid off-by-one errors with interval boundaries.\n\nReason step by step following the above steps. Output only the final answer.",
